It&amp;amp;#39;s not the sure-fire doomsday scenario it was 2 months ago.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;The herd.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When it comes to investing, be careful of following the herd.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Last year, the herd thought Bitcoin was heading to the moon and could hit $100K. And that&amp;amp;#39;s when the herd was overbuying.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Things aren&amp;amp;#39;t looking good. But is the data really showing only doomsday? I&amp;amp;#39;ll explore that in details.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Not every correction is a recession. Not every bear market is long term (see the 2013 mini bear market of 5 months for Bitcoin).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Inflation:&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is the big one. Inflation is still high, but it&amp;amp;#39;s showing signs of slowing down, and potentially having peaked already. If it starts going down, will it still be able to fuel further market fears?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Both CPI and PCE rates have slowed down.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;-CPI slowed from 8.5% in March down to 8.2% in April.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;-PCE has slowed from 6.6% in March down to 6.2% in April.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Obviously real inflation is higher, but these are important for later when we talk about Fed rates.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But what about food and gas still being so expensive? It still costs me so much, how can it have peaked? That brings up the next two points.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Supply chain:&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Probably one of the biggest wrench getting in the way of economic growth in the last 2 years.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Luckily, the supply chain is beginning to reopen, and the bottleneck is getting unclogged. But it has been an uneven recovery.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While you see a lot of items back on the shelves, and shipment taking less time, you have other items like baby formula vanishing from the shelves.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The big one everyone is waiting for is for China to join in that de-clogging. They&amp;amp;#39;re still behind due to their more recent lockdowns.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the US this year:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;47% drop in ship congestion (those ships anchored waiting outside a port).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;12% increase in containers in the main ports (LA, New Jersey, New York, Long beach).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In Europe, they experienced a setback with the war in Ukraine. With some ports getting increases in delays by several hours, sometimes up to two days.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In terms of sea shipping  worldwide, the bottleneck is still high thanks to China and Russia, but we are starting to also see signs that it has peaked:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/6t9zd84c4n291.png?width=990&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=54d4e555c3b0f72dcde6e85bafb82c87ccc0ee31&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/6t9zd84c4n291.png?width=990&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=54d4e555c3b0f72dcde6e85bafb82c87ccc0ee31&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Things are still not looking great and are uneven, but it looks like in many countries we are starting to see things turn around.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Overall, the world waiting time for all cargo ships has dropped. Going from 17 million container waiting days down to 6 million.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Oil: the domino effect that could put the breaks on a recession.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Oil prices has everyone worried.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It has also been a big contributors for rising CPI numbers, and the perceived inflation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It has also been a problem for supply chains, along with businesses. And has put strain on many companies in the stock market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So it&amp;amp;#39;s been in the middle of almost all of our problems.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here&amp;amp;#39;s some good news.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One of the main reason it&amp;amp;#39;s so high, is because OPEC hasn&amp;amp;#39;t increased the output to keep up with the big emerging demand from the post covid crisis, nor make up for the strain from the war in Ukraine.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The purposely held back output to let price rises, to makeup for all the money they lost when oil prices tanked in 2020. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;OPEC is actually due to increase the output in July, per their internal agreement, by 400K barrels per day. So relief will begin this summer.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The G7 meeting has asked them to increase it by even more. So we&amp;amp;#39;ll have to see how big the relief will be.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If oil price output increases significantly, it could bring the price down more significantly, helping everything from inflation to supply chains and businesses.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And it could create a domino effect that could help ignite a potential recovery.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Fed rates:&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Rates don&amp;amp;#39;t have much uncertainty left. Feds have already laid out the roadmap. We know how high they want to go. And unless inflation starts to spiral out of control again, it looks like they are targeting 2-2.5% rates. So only going back to pre-covid rates.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These are still economic stimulation level of rates. They&amp;amp;#39;re not high rates.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now that we got a good idea on how fast they&amp;amp;#39;ll go with the point basis, there&amp;amp;#39;s not much left that hasn&amp;amp;#39;t been priced in already.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The only question is the Fed balance sheet unloading. That&amp;amp;#39;s a little harder to predict the effect. But there won&amp;amp;#39;t be a selling off, they&amp;amp;#39;ll just let bonds expire.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also, keep in mind that legislation has changed a little, with the ability for banks to get their liquidity. So it won&amp;amp;#39;t be quiet the same as it was in the past.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;War in Ukraine:&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I can&amp;amp;#39;t really say too much about this. There&amp;amp;#39;s no clear metrics to talk about here.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This could end next month, or it could end in 5 years.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One thing we do know, is Putin wasn&amp;amp;#39;t able to roll over Ukraine, and move on to the next conquest.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In terms of market uncertainty, it has fizzled out a little bit, and is nowhere near at the level of fear as the early days of the war.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;US GDP:&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is the one place where we can still see an alarming case for a recession.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The GDP has decreased by 1.5%.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That&amp;amp;#39;s as bad as it can get.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But a big part of that decrease was actually caused by the trade deficit, rather than a decrease in spending. Consumer spending actually increased by 2.7%. Inflation adjusted, it still increased by 0.7%.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also, supply chain issues, and slower inventory accumulation fueled that decrease. The effect of high inflation also didn&amp;amp;#39;t help.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But if those problems have already reached their peak, ports are now getting unclogged, and with the trade deficit already going back down, we can have better expectations for much better GDP numbers next quarter.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Can we still have a recession?&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Both in crypto and other markets.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While things may look like they have reached their peak, and there are some improvements already, you never know when there could be set backs.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So I&amp;amp;#39;m definitely not trying to be Nostradamus here. I&amp;amp;#39;m just saying a recession is not 100% in the cards. In fact, it may be starting to diminish in probabilities.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is definitely not your 2008 recession. We still have low unemployment, a strong housing market, trade deficit dropping 15.9%, growing consumer spending, and we don&amp;amp;#39;t have foreclosures popping up everywhere.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bankruptcies filling have also been dropping in the US:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/2ue7dlkj4n291.png?width=782&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=dcbc5af846604e4b395b270d7aacdf7f80cdba1b&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/2ue7dlkj4n291.png?width=782&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=dcbc5af846604e4b395b270d7aacdf7f80cdba1b&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What&amp;amp;#39;s important is to understand the cause of all this, to understand if we are heading straight into a recession.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;The cause.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Where did it all go wrong, and how did we get here in both crypto and other markets?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Long story short: liquidity supply crunch.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Both crypto and stocks have been getting extra fuel with the extra liquidity being printed into the market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Both went a little too high too fast, and got a little overbought.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It was natural that we&amp;amp;#39;d get a correction once the Fed turned off that printer.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So this isn&amp;amp;#39;t exactly a crash where you have foreclosures popping up all over neighborhoods, bankruptcies, and financial institutions collapsing, like in 2008.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is more the market correcting to adjust back to normal pre-covid liquidity.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In fact, for crypto, it may not even be like 2018, and be more like 2013.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Where we got a mini bear market for 5 months in the middle of a bull cycle:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/flk4i3235n291.jpg?width=1262&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=3d96d3ac5785cd6cd0b9443eb4d6abd73270e1a0&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/flk4i3235n291.jpg?width=1262&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=3d96d3ac5785cd6cd0b9443eb4d6abd73270e1a0&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;tl;dr:&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All the same macos that were supporting the theory that we were heading into a long recession, are now showing signs of either peaking, slowing down, or even turning around.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And if a couple of key macros like GDP, supply chain, or oil have a significant turnaround, it could create a domino effect that could fuel a recovery. Or at the very least erase a lot of the fuel behind the recession.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And all 3 are showing data that they are likely to turn around in the coming months.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This doesn&amp;amp;#39;t mean it will necessarily happen, or that we won&amp;amp;#39;t have a long recession. There&amp;amp;#39;s still a strong possibility. Just not as strong as many people think, and definitely not close to 100%. And the likelihood has begun to decrease.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

He said, he had &amp;amp;quot;a model that predicts the last 2 BTC bottom prices&amp;amp;quot; and based on this model, predicted what the next bottom price will be. In the comments, he showed a lot of confidence in his complex model, because &amp;amp;quot;There is a reasoning behind&amp;amp;quot; it and &amp;amp;quot;It&amp;amp;#39;s gonna happen&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Okay, so I thought even though two data points is not really great (to be very euphemistic) and using data from those two data points to predict the same data points is, uh, not best practice, I&amp;amp;#39;m curious what sort of factors they included in their model to get to their estimate. Had to be somewhat complex for them to be so convinced, right?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yeah, no. After eyeballing the &amp;amp;quot;data&amp;amp;quot;, I immediately saw that the BTC &amp;amp;quot;model&amp;amp;quot; was:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;2013 bull run: bottom was roughly ATH divided by 6.5&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;2017 bull run: bottom was roughly ATH divided by 6&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;prediction: so this time it will be ATH divided by 5.5&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Seriously, that&amp;amp;#39;s the whole &amp;amp;quot;model&amp;amp;quot;. His ETH model was even more complex: it&amp;amp;#39;s only based on a single data point but hey, that&amp;amp;#39;s more than zero I guess? There their prediction, which is calculated &amp;amp;quot;applying a corrective factor (eth volatility)&amp;amp;quot; is even more complex: &amp;amp;quot;ETH bottom is always previous ATH divided by 12&amp;amp;quot;. That&amp;amp;#39;s maths for you!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Someone else said in the comments &amp;amp;quot;If you want to see some real math possibilities, then check out the BTC/ETH rainbow charts.&amp;amp;quot; - Jesus, people! It was literally created &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ercwl/status/1341061789182791683&quot;&amp;gt;as a joke&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, there&amp;amp;#39;s no maths behind it and no, it doesn&amp;amp;#39;t work!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Why am I making this post? Because if you&amp;amp;#39;re new-ish to crypto (or just a bit naive) and are seeing a post like that, you might think that those people probably know more than you if they make those predictions, and you might think &amp;amp;quot;even if they are not precise, how can those data-driven predictions be far off?&amp;amp;quot;. The truth is pretty easy, however: &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;predictions like that are complete garbage&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. Not every prediction is on the level of &amp;amp;quot;complete this series of numbers&amp;amp;quot; like the one above, that could be an assignment for like a fourth grader, some include more numbers and complex model specifications. But they&amp;amp;#39;re still complete nonsense. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We simply don&amp;amp;#39;t know what will happen - maybe the economy will crash, maybe it will boom, maybe another LUNA-like fiasco will happen. Those things affect how BTC and ETH will behave. You can build a model that perfectly predicts previous ATHs or ATLs or whatever - honestly, it&amp;amp;#39;s very, very easy - and it doesn&amp;amp;#39;t help you even a bit predicting the future.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Long story short: all &amp;amp;quot;technical analysis&amp;amp;quot; is complete nonsense and you shouldn&amp;amp;#39;t fall for it - no matter if it&amp;amp;#39;s done by someone on the level of a 10-year old like the OP I am quoting or something more complex.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Stable coin regulation is coming and there is nothing anyone can do about it. I don’t actually think this is a bad thing to prevent future meltdowns (full audit of tether pls).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So what does this c#ck head do…….creates Luna 2.0. This is a regulators wet dream. The optics on this whole thing are so incredibly bad.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To ALL of the exchanges out there who listed this token……you fucked up. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Not only do the regulators have hard on for flogs like Do Kwon, but you are in their crosshairs even more now. Exchanges literally listed the exit pump token for Do Kwon’s initial ponzi. Utterly psychotic. Like how can they be so stupid.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Exchanges should have denied the listing of Luna 2.0. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

While people still invest in bitcoin hoping to cash out for fiat, you can be sure bitcoin will not decouple from fiat currency, and you&amp;amp;#39;ll see the &amp;amp;quot;value&amp;amp;quot; of it move with other markets tied to fiat (although we all know the real value is priceless)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We know the central banking system is collapsing. The ship is sinking and they cannot keep it afloat much longer. Decades of manipulation and Bipolar policy has damaged fiat beyond repair. It&amp;amp;#39;s going to zero, as it has in many areas of the world already. When you buy bitcoin you should understand you&amp;amp;#39;re betting against the central banks. You&amp;amp;#39;re betting against fiat currency altogether. You&amp;amp;#39;re expressing your desire to see this decentralized monetary system become the standard, so you should expect to have to hold for a decade or several decades to see the vision come true. Once the fiat currency system finally collapses for good (and it will) your Bitcoin will be the only life raft you have. It will be the only life raft anyone has, and then you&amp;amp;#39;ll see everything else valued in satoshis. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Do you think the world is going back to trading physical gold when fiat finally collapses? I don&amp;amp;#39;t think so. In today&amp;amp;#39;s world technology is important and convenience. The world will choose bitcoin when central banking dies. Get on the boat and don&amp;amp;#39;t sell your bitcoin for any shitcoins especially the ultimate shitcoin USD.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;More than likely. Crypto price runs on hype and hope and there&amp;amp;#39;s gonna be both during a major downturn. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That being said, it&amp;amp;#39;s still speculative, and will continue to be until/if there&amp;amp;#39;s good reason for everyone to interact with it. And speculative investments are NOT where the money stays during major downturns.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You know what does go to the moon? Layoffs, interest rates, political and social strife, corruption, disease, death. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That&amp;amp;#39;s what to prepare for. Have a safety net of some kind. Do you have savings for if you or your partner(s) get laid off? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What do you do if the place you&amp;amp;#39;re renting gets sold off to cover some landlord&amp;amp;#39;s margin, and the new buyer raises your rents past what you can afford?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Do you have skills and network and savings to survive if suddenly your luck goes worse for 3-6 months?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If not, that&amp;amp;#39;s where to focus. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Learn from the past. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;P.S. some of the biggest false rallies happen during downturns, so try to stick to whatever DCA/plan you have and try to avoid fomoing in more.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Let&amp;amp;#39;s do a quick recap:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Launch a algorithmic &amp;amp;quot;stablecoin&amp;amp;quot; backed by almost nothing&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Offer !riskless! 20% intrest to holders of that stablecoin (Ponzi anyone?)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Ignore every warning about your &amp;amp;quot;stablecoin&amp;amp;quot; beeing not stable at all&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Your &amp;amp;quot;stablecoin&amp;amp;quot; loses its peg&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Blame &amp;amp;quot;attackers&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Sell your assets that are supposed to back your coin OTC to big investors to make them whole again. (Who cares about small investors...)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;...&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Profit&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;repeat&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I mean seriously who buys this shit now? Don&amp;amp;#39;t expect anyone to feel sorry for you this time. Everyone knows this is is a scam.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Normally I wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t ever say &amp;amp;quot;don&amp;amp;#39;t buy the dip&amp;amp;quot;. But mark my words, I&amp;amp;#39;ve been invested in this market going on 7 years, and I&amp;amp;#39;ve literally and figuratively almost seen it all to a point I can sense when shit is about to stink really bad.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I do not know what is going to make me rich, but I am dam good at seeing what is not going to make me rich.   Luna isn&amp;amp;#39;t one of them.    I&amp;amp;#39;m sure it will go up and give some sense to people that there is still hope.  Hey, some may even be able to make 10x before it goes through it&amp;amp;#39;s final crash shortly after but you can do the same thing with shitcoins.  So other than trying to time that risky market, you really aren&amp;amp;#39;t going anywhere sticking around with Luna.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I know die hard Luna fans don&amp;amp;#39;t want to hear it but

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;ll try and do a super quick catch up with no added fluff.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Safemoon has a &amp;amp;quot;locked&amp;amp;quot; liquidity pool, meaning they can&amp;amp;#39;t just withdraw the BNB or Safemoon tokens. It&amp;amp;#39;s locked til 2025.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s one of several LP&amp;amp;#39;s, which aren&amp;amp;#39;t locked.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;They moved from V1 token to V2, with a new unaudited contract&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The moving process is widely considered a honeypot, with investor losses tallying over $5m due to being taxed 100% if you don&amp;amp;#39;t move in exactly the right way.&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/uigey5/4899739_a_complete_view_of_the_safemoon_v1_100/&quot;&amp;gt;(see previous post)&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;hr/&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So May 11th was a very perilous time for Safemoon holders. Amidst the deepening bear market and failure of the Mandala launch (&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/STK65dO&quot;&amp;gt;$17 bucks in 24hr volume&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;), Safemoon&amp;amp;#39;s token price had dropped 48% in week to make a new low on the 11th of just $0.000289 per token (a 98% loss from the V1 ATH of $0.014 - price adjusted for V2)  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Safemoon LLC posted this statement;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/923316772227153957/974075451888767046/FSgkCRvWQAEDySj.jpg?width=1618&amp;amp;amp;height=910&quot;&amp;gt;In connection with the migration of SFMV1 to SFMV2, SafeMoon is seeking to migrate BNB held in LPs associated with SFMV1 into LPs associated with SFMV2. In connection with that migration, SafeMoon may from time to time acquire SFMV2 in the open market, subject to market conditions and other factors.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All of a sudden, Safemoon pumped 274% in a few hours.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;What the fuck happened there?&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You know that locked Liquidity pool? That&amp;amp;#39;s only half the story. There are many other unlocked LP&amp;amp;#39;s, and the Safemoon developers have been dipping their dirty little hands in and scooping out the liquidity.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Let&amp;amp;#39;s be clear here.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;SAFEMOON LLC ARE THE CUSTODIANS OF THESE FUNDS, THEY DO NOT OWN THESE TOKENS&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Safemoon LLC, and other Cryptocurrency tokens (in the DeFi space or otherwise) get funds like this:  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Pre-sale - selling minted tokens directly for ETH, BNB etc.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Selling tokens minted throughout the token&amp;amp;#39;s life&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Collecting fees etc.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With Safemoon LLC, they held a &amp;amp;quot;&amp;amp;quot;&amp;amp;quot;Fair Launch&amp;amp;quot;&amp;amp;quot;&amp;amp;quot; where tokens were not advertised in any capacity and yet they managed to secure thousands of dollars worth of BNB. They also have the famed 10% buy and 10% sell tax, where a portion of fees are allocated to devs. Other than that, they have no other ways to accumulate funds.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Apart from the liquidity pool.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When people buy and sell Safemoon, it&amp;amp;#39;s done through the liquidity pool which contains a pairing of tokens. X Safemoon per 1 BNB, which dictates the price. Those tokens come from the community. They are not Safemoon LLC&amp;amp;#39;s tokens. When Safemoon sells Mike 1,000,000 Safemoon tokens, and then Mike sells those tokens for 1 BNB to someone else, Safemoon LLC doesn&amp;amp;#39;t own that 1,000,000 Safemoon or the 1 BNB.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;hr/&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;Within minutes of posting the above on Twitter &amp;amp;amp; Discord, Safemoon LLC started dumping V1 tokens by the trillions.&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here is one such transaction, the wallet ending in 76bc is known as the &amp;amp;quot;CFO wallet&amp;amp;quot; (and since Safemoon has no CFO any more, it&amp;amp;#39;s John Karony the CEO)  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://bscscan.com/tx/0x1bdf563996ead8cc0c915d109f91ac96e3798b5b4c07b801d279944a76432b91&quot;&amp;gt;In this transaction, 2.4 Trillion V1 Tokens were swapped for 883 BNB worth $276.8K.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In total, this wallet extracted 37 Trillion V1 tokens and 22,894 BNB from the unlocked V1 Liquidity pool, in addition to &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://bscscan.com/tx/0x79ce08720b3ab4507bd036a43a2c2f9274eb2156dc3d0622647746ada9defd80&quot;&amp;gt;withdrawing 2,296 BNB from a Binance Hot Wallet&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That&amp;amp;#39;s 25,190 BNB.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;$7,896,480&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And what was done with this BNB? Minutes after accumulating $8 Million bucks of investors money, Safemoon LLC bought  7,965,639,635 Safemoon V2 tokens on the open market, spiking the price up nearly 4x over, which of course...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/mvBBDMa.png&quot;&amp;gt;A whale immediately took advantage of and thanked John &amp;amp;amp; Co. for the exit liquidity.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The problem here is that Safemoon LLC neglected to move the LP in a proper manner. They could have just withdrawn the BNB &amp;amp;amp; V1 tokens, burned the V1 as they&amp;amp;#39;re obsolete, then simply deposited the BNB in the V2 Liquidity Pool.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Instead, the CEO chose to buy V2 tokens on the open market - inflating the price of the asset, while securing almost 8 Billion V2 tokens for himself. The CEO has therefore enriched himself at the holders expense.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://np.reddit.com/r/SafeMoon/comments/unr2is/believe_in_john_believe_in_his_team_i_told_you/&quot;&amp;gt;And yet, all over Twitter, Reddit &amp;amp;amp; Discord, folks are praising him for &amp;amp;quot;4D Chess&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;WARNING: Link will melt your brain&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. Their CEO has enriched himself using money that should be meant for the liquidity pool, provided exit liquidity for a whale and opened themselves up to even more legal action. And they are thanking him for it.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/84tbhiiiauz81.jpg?width=1024&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=9adb13d58c9a8a782a5b60811c85235ff1dd6f0b&quot;&amp;gt;Oh, and he clearly has no intention of returning it to all the poor people who lost their funds on the ruthless 100% tax.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Insane.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It appears that UST/LUNA was attacked, but how did this happen? Well… maybe if you hadn&amp;amp;#39;t declared to the world how to precisely implode your coin and told billionaires to &amp;amp;quot;try it&amp;amp;quot;, then maybe this wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t have happened LOL.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But here’s the interesting part… &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Immediately after LUNA&amp;amp;#39;s downfall, there was a &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://i.redd.it/f1rvti5wury81.jpg&quot;&amp;gt;post&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; claiming that Blackrock and Citadel had borrowed 100k BTC and exchanged 25k for UST which dried up most of its liquidity. After that, it&amp;amp;#39;s thought they threw the remaining 75k on the market, causing Luna to implode.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This was a pure profit play if a short was opened at the top. Do Kwon (CEO) (probably) fell for the 25k BTC trade bait and accidentally was responsible for his currency&amp;amp;#39;s fate. Again this is just theory.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The process is fairly easy and will cost you surprisingly little, the entire process cost me only 15 ALGOs and I could still withdraw most of that out of the wallet I created for this project. I decided to use Algorand for this due to it&amp;amp;#39;s ease of use and low fees.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Step one: The Wallet&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Create a Pera Wallet and transfer around 15 ALGO into it. (around $5.00 USD)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Pera wallet is available on Android and IOS, you can also use any other ALGO wallet you prefer.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Step Two: Creating the Algorand Standard Asset&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Head on over to &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://algodesk.io&quot;&amp;gt;algodesk.io&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and connect said wallet.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;click on the top right button labeled &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;create asset,&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; you will get the following box pop up. fill in the required information and confirm the transaction on you wallet. (this fee I believe is around 1 ALGO)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;For this example I decided to create the shittiest shit coin I could think of so its called ButtCoinASA in honor of&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/Buttcoin&quot;&amp;gt;r/Buttcoin&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/08a2w3mpgw191.png?width=955&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=9ca17782da4c0bc41ef1e7f3f51a8b7c7f5d3283&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/08a2w3mpgw191.png?width=955&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=9ca17782da4c0bc41ef1e7f3f51a8b7c7f5d3283&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Congratulations, you are now the proud owner of your very own ALGO ASA&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Step Three: Providing Liquidity&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So now you have this new asset in your wallet but its not really known to the world, what to do?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Visit Algorands best DEX called &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://tinyman.org&quot;&amp;gt;tinyman.org&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; then follow the steps below.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;connect wallet&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;click on the tab labeled &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;pool&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;click create pair&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;select Algo and (your new ASA), you&amp;amp;#39;ll have to search for it and click on the box labeled &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;hide unverified assets&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/p8seesx5jw191.png?width=785&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=dc79bdbee1136fccac25bae73ab6a4836c73b5ec&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/p8seesx5jw191.png?width=785&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=dc79bdbee1136fccac25bae73ab6a4836c73b5ec&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;now add as much ALGO and your ASA as you want (this will give it your initial value, if you add 1 ALGO and one ButtCoin then 1 ALGO = 1 Butt)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Congrats, your ShitCoin now has some value&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;wait about thirty minutes and then head on over to &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://tinychart.org&quot;&amp;gt;tinychart.org&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/gtfprjtvjw191.png?width=1659&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=bb7c84a5705bb8362f47036c486d855fe3109d08&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/gtfprjtvjw191.png?width=1659&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=bb7c84a5705bb8362f47036c486d855fe3109d08&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;and look, your ShitCoin is now listed and shows a value.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Step Four: Be A Millionaire&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;that&amp;amp;#39;s it&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Your done.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You are now a Millionaire *&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;on paper&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So I created ButtCoinASA and I hold all one billion of them so if you multiply 1,000,000,000 x $0.0019 + 1.9 million dollars!!!!!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;sure I cant cash it out because it only has $3.00 worth of liquidity but it does look like green on that chart to me so I&amp;amp;#39;ll take it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So there you have it boys and girls, you are now the owner of your very own bonafied Shit Coin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What can you do with it? well what ever you&amp;amp;#39;d like to&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;share it with friends&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;give it to strangers&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;start some sort of reward system for your kids&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;if your competent maybe even turn it into an actual project with some real uses and make some money&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;the sky is the limit&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Edit: This is a shitcoin and I&amp;amp;#39;m giving it away by the thousands, please do not provide liquidity I don&amp;amp;#39;t want to be responsible for people losing their money.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
