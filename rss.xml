&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here&amp;amp;#39;s what Tesla &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;will&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; be accepting DOGE for:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) will accept meme-based cryptocurrency dogecoin as payment for its &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;merchandise&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; such as the &amp;amp;quot;Giga Texas&amp;amp;quot; belt buckle and mini models of electric vehicles, Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said in a tweet on Friday.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In other words, you can buy a few Tesla toys and a belt buckle like this one (835 DOGE):&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://shop.tesla.com/product/giga-texas-belt-buckle?sku=1758879-00-A&quot;&amp;gt;https://shop.tesla.com/product/giga-texas-belt-buckle?sku=1758879-00-A&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;DOGE had a predictable and modest 20% gain following the non news &amp;amp;#39;news&amp;amp;#39;, which probably enabled Elon to lighten his bags yet again.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/technology/tesla-merchandise-buyable-using-dogecoin-musk-says-tweet-2022-01-14/&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.reuters.com/technology/tesla-merchandise-buyable-using-dogecoin-musk-says-tweet-2022-01-14/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To see that this really is becoming a joke, the EXACT SAME news was reported on the EXACT SAME DAY last month (14th December):

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If anyone’s interested in the full un-summarized version the link is here: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/j5cEdmAeICU&quot;&amp;gt;https://youtu.be/j5cEdmAeICU&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Preface&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the top 40 tokens ranked by market cap only 6 aren’t on Ethereum, with those being on the Binance smart chain, but this makes sense, if you were opening a shop in real life, you’d want to do it where the people are, and not in the middle of the countryside. Ethereum, while long maintaining it’s position as the largest smart contract chain does have its problems, those being gas fees and congestion.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This means that while anything built on Ethereum gets the benefits of decentralisation and security, it inherits those problems too.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;DEXs are in my opinion though are some of the most important aspects to the free trade of crypto, allowing for swapping between any on chain, or wrapped asset, but if you wanted to perform a trade on uniswap now you’d be paying well over $150 in fees.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And this is where loopring comes in, aiming to not only solve these existing problems and provide a completely new take on how DEX’s should function.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Foundation&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Like a lot of the current markets most promising protocols, Loopring, created by Daniel Wang an ex google software engineer, first appeared in the form of an ICO in the 2017 bull run raising 45 million. Unfortunately, Daniel and his team are based in Shanghai, and as we all know China loves to flip flop on their crypto regulation, coming out with new laws outlawing ICO’s forcing the Loopring Foundation to refund most of the funds earnt. However, from the ICO there was 20k Ethereum not refunded, which at the time was worth around 7.5 million, and with this they forged on with the creation of the Loopring protocol.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Unlike a lot of projects in the crypto space that start their marketing extremely early to try and hook investors sometimes before the product even has a working first version, Looping’s focus was on creating the product and then letting it sell itself. Arguably had the market not become so crowded with people almost acting like salesmen trying to shove any half-baked crypto project down people’s throats this strategy probably would’ve worked.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This isn’t to say that the company isn’t starting to move towards providing a greater feature set such as Ethereum virtual machine compatibility but given how tight lipped they’ve been on the topic shows that they don’t want this to dominate the narrative of what the platform actually currently does.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Loopring Protocol&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Loopring aims to give anyone the tools to build their own DEX but without needing to go through any of the problems in actually starting a DEX, Loopring is to decentralised exchanges what the Tendermint SDK is to Proof of stake. Its certainly not the only way to do it, but it cuts out a large portion of the groundwork required.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At the core of Loopring is a Zero Knowledge Proof rollup layer built on top of the Ethereum base chain, since not many people know what this actually is or entails, I thought Id briefly explain it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Zero Knowledge proof is not unique to crypto, it in fact pre-dates it by over 25 years, and is a cryptographic protocol that allows a party to prove that a statement is true to a recipient party, what makes it significant though is that the recipient party doesn’t need to be privy to any potentially secret information that goes into proving the statement.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Think of it like a magic trick, if a magician said he could predict the suit and number of a card we will draw from a deck of cards, and then proceeds to do it and get it right, we can assume that it wasn’t just sheer luck, and that he can in fact do what he says he can, but we as the second party have no idea how the trick was done.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So when we apply this to crypto we get the ability to prove to the base chain that something happening on a side chain or layer 2 is verifiably true, which as we all know is extremely important in a trustless environment like a blockchain.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So now we move onto the rollup part, on the base chain, in this case Ethereum, a transaction is a single monetary transfer from a to b, this means that to process 100 transfers, you need 100 transactions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A much more efficient way of doing this would be to process 100 transfers and put them all through at once under a single transaction. The problem with doing this however is the blockchain can only verify the transaction and not data within the event log of the transaction and so in this case it would assume the 100 transactions are all invalid and reject them unless it could be proven otherwise.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So, to combine this all together, a zkRollup works by performing transactions off chain, and then submitting them back to the main chain as a single transaction with the proof required to confirm that what happened off chain still conforms to the base chain’s rules, and that they’re all valid transactions so that the base chain can process them accordingly as though it had done the work itself.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This technology is what Loopring uses along with Relayers to allow anyone to create a DEX and keep gas fees low.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At the core of everything is the loopring relayer. The relayer is in charge of virtually everything in the ecosystem, from generating the proofs, building blocks, matching orderbooks and more.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The loopring protocol will work with any relayer, however there is currently a single canonical relayer being used which is run by the Loopring foundation, now I do have some concerns about this which I will, as usual, cover at the end, but all you need to know is that the Loopring protocol is entirely non-custodial.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Token Supply and Distribution&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There’s currently 1.2 billion LRC in circulation, which is 100 million less than the max supply of 1.3 billion which is due to the fact that a portion of the supply has been burnt.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Any operation the loopring protocol will incur a fee, same as performing any action on the blockchain, in the case of Loopring this is just 0.3% of the transaction value, where 0.2% is returned to the liquidity providers as incentive and 0.1% goes to the loopring DAO.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The use of the LRC value held by the Loopring DAO is voted on, with the options for its use being grants to incentivize partnerships, impermanent loss protection, liquidity incentives on top of the 0.2% fee, and then finally burning LRC.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Concerns&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Firstly, despite the protocol being Relayer agnostic, that is to say that anyone can build a relayer and start to perform network actions, the only current Relayer operated by the Loopring foundation. This unfortunately does mean that there’s a centralised aspect to the network as it currently stands.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now, hopefully I’ve done a good enough job of explaining why this isn’t an immediate red flag for the platform, given that the entire point is to be non-custodial and have layers on layers of protocol specifics to ensure that control is always entirely in the user’s hands, I just personally don’t like the fact that the security of an investment into LRC would depend on the Loopring foundation upkeeping that relayer.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And my second concern is to do with marketting.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As it stands currently loopring has $450m locked within the contract, which for a project sitting at 2.1 billion market cap is lower than I would’ve expected. Take Curve for example, which is sitting only 100 million dollars higher in market cap but has over 20 billion dollars locked by it’s contract on Ethereum alone.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This on its own might not be cause for concern but the DEX created by the Loopring foundation was born out of being unable to secure partners to build their own DEX’s and show off the platform. This to me shows that for the platform to survive, more of an emphasis needs to be placed on getting the protocol out into the wider DeFi audience and not just within the retail space where it currently seems to be sitting.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Executive Order 6102&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; is an &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States&quot;&amp;gt;executive order&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;) signed on April 5, 1933, by &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_President&quot;&amp;gt;US President&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt&quot;&amp;gt;Franklin D. Roosevelt&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; &amp;amp;quot;forbidding the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoarding_(economics&quot;&amp;gt;hoarding&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;) of &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_coin&quot;&amp;gt;gold coin&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_bullion&quot;&amp;gt;gold bullion&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, and &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_certificates&quot;&amp;gt;gold certificates&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; within the continental United States.&amp;amp;quot; The executive order was made under the authority of the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trading_with_the_Enemy_Act_of_1917&quot;&amp;gt;Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, as amended by the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Banking_Act&quot;&amp;gt;Emergency Banking Act&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; in March 1933.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The stated reason for the order was that hard times had caused &amp;amp;quot;hoarding&amp;amp;quot; of gold, stalling economic growth and worsening the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression&quot;&amp;gt;depression&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; as the US was then using  the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard&quot;&amp;gt;gold standard&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; for its currency.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

See &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://explorer.harmony.one/blocks/shard/0&quot;&amp;gt;https://explorer.harmony.one/blocks/shard/0&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; for proof. I&amp;amp;#39;m super conflicted on how I feel about this. I have been a ONE supporter and fan from early 2021 onward, and I&amp;amp;#39;m super excited for the future since amazing dApps are being built on it as we speak. It seems so odd that they have dozens of people working on development, but somehow they can&amp;amp;#39;t figure out how to handle their RPC or prevent/fix spam attacks on the network.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The main reason I&amp;amp;#39;m going to stick around is the amazing group of people and developers that are in this space. The developer of &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://fuzz.fi&quot;&amp;gt;fuzz.fi&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; decided to run his own RPC and there&amp;amp;#39;s a couple of other groups/people as well that try to support the Harmony Ecosystem in any way they can.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Props to the people that are working on this 24/7, but it&amp;amp;#39;s time to grow up and fix stuff. We&amp;amp;#39;re a Top50 coin now, time to move forward, onwards and upwards!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Today there are 5525 campaigns effectively running and being seen by the users!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These number is a new ATH!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/h4fzamv48nb81.png?width=720&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=398e4817bbbf0c7b7e821fa30e710c2930005165&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/h4fzamv48nb81.png?width=720&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=398e4817bbbf0c7b7e821fa30e710c2930005165&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The increase of campaigns is massive: on this day in 2021 there were 1359 campaigns running.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This means a plus of over 300% in one year!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Calculated for half a year, taking the 14th of June 2021 as the day, we see 4085 campaigns.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Which in turn gives us a growth of over 35% in 6 month!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Of course not all the regions have the same amount of ads shown. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;the top 10 regions are as following:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/gsxkcgjg8nb81.jpg?width=1030&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=6d3aacaa3133c0de75773268e33d6ed876b1aead&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/gsxkcgjg8nb81.jpg?width=1030&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=6d3aacaa3133c0de75773268e33d6ed876b1aead&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To find out how many and what ads are being shown in your region, visit  &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://sampson.codes/brave/ads/my_region/&quot;&amp;gt;Brave Ads in My Region (sampson.codes)&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; .&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To see examples of ads run around the world, visit  &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://brave.photos/&quot;&amp;gt;Home - Brave browser sponsored image archive&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Ad campaigns are bought with BAT or the any other currency, which will be exchanged to BAT by Brave. Brave in turn will redistribute the earned BAT as rewards to the users.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The digital ad industry today is worth hundreds of billions, and will grow to a trillion+ dollar industry this decade.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Those numbers are really bullish for the future of Brave and its token BAT, and i feel like the future is really bright for this project!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Of course a few of them might have the potential to give you great returns, but a lot of people completely end up ignoring the risk factor. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;CryptoMoonShots vs &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/Cryptocurrency&quot;&amp;gt;r/Cryptocurrency&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/azvhoo2o3nb81.png?width=1099&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=d6668d709c5ff7f2f82bd1a4ef1ce276700af48d&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/azvhoo2o3nb81.png?width=1099&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=d6668d709c5ff7f2f82bd1a4ef1ce276700af48d&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The CryptoMoonShots subreddit has even started to outpace the Cryptocurrency subreddit in terms of growth. It is a terrible thing to see considering the vast majority of the cryptocurrencies advertised there there are complete scam projects. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Don&amp;amp;#39;t get me wrong. Some low market coins do have great utility and great future potential, but when you start going lower into the low millions or hundreds of thousands, the risk far outweighs their benefits.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you are new to Crypto, the best thing you can do in Crypto is DCA and accumulate larger projects for the long term. Crypto is not the stock market, and deviating away from trusted projects or trying to rely on technical analysis is very risky.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TLDR: Unfortunately a lot of the newbies that are joining Crypto are completely ignoring even top 100 coins and are choosing to put their money in these shady &amp;amp;quot;get rich quick&amp;amp;quot; schemes which is nothing short of gambling.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

According to Alderoty, the SEC would deliberately try to delay the lawsuit between themselves and Ripple as long as possible.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Ripple lawsuit&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Ripple, meanwhile, has been embroiled in an infamous lawsuit with the US SEC for over a year. The SEC accuses Ripple of selling securities in the past without the necessary licenses. At the moment, Ripple is hopeful that the lawsuit will soon come to an end and the judge will finally issue a ruling. However, Alderoty lashed out at the SEC on Twitter. He believes that the SEC does not want the court case to end any time soon.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/jisowqdswhb81.png?width=498&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=4e9c680ce369d60ff1003268f0fa06d86912468a&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/jisowqdswhb81.png?width=498&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=4e9c680ce369d60ff1003268f0fa06d86912468a&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Gary Gensler&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the series of Twitter messages, Alderoty responds to a message from SEC Chairman Gary Gensler. Gensler revealed why, in his opinion, enforcement of rules is one of the SEC&amp;amp;#39;s most important tasks. Soccer without referees would turn into an unfair occupation in no time according to Gensler. If teams don&amp;amp;#39;t have to worry about penalties and enforcement of the rules, things will go wrong. The same goes for the markets, according to Gensler. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/dmwxeixuwhb81.png?width=509&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=0ef5caa037c3fe6e1f067f0eed849ae04b274c14&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/dmwxeixuwhb81.png?width=509&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=0ef5caa037c3fe6e1f067f0eed849ae04b274c14&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Alderoty argues that the SEC is guilty of &amp;amp;quot;regulation by enforcement.&amp;amp;quot; That by simply initiating a lawsuit against an entity they are trying to control certain markets. This is also why, according to Alderoty, the SEC does not seem to be in any particular hurry in the lawsuit.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Ripple&amp;amp;#39;s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, still seemed convinced in November of last year that the lawsuit will end this year. In addition, he is hopeful that the judge&amp;amp;#39;s ruling will also be in Ripple&amp;amp;#39;s favor.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I sort by New due to wanting to read and comment on brand new post and I have now seen this  post about Kim kardashian and Floyd Maywether getting sued over some crypto scam posted Dozens of times if not hundreds. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I would like to state up front that I am in favor of moon farming but feel like a little bit of effort should be put in, not just constantly posting news articles that have already been posted. I am not asking for much, just a quick search to see if its been posted ten times in the last hour already. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Is there a solution to this? Perhaps&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But I dont have any answers or the power to make any changes on this sub, I just wanted to let you guys know that Kim and Floyd are getting sued and its crypto related.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now that everybody knows this, please stop posting the same articles over and over and I will give every post after mine that is not a news article an award until I run out of my Reddit coins.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thank you for attending my Rant, and may you be blessed with awards and moons in this difficult time.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We also think there is very high stakes game theory at play here, whereby if bitcoin adoption increases, the countries that secure some bitcoin today will be better off competitively than their peers. Therefore, even if other countries do not believe in the investment thesis or adoption of bitcoin, they will be forced to acquire some as a form of insurance. In other words, a small cost can be paid today as a hedge compared to a potentially much larger cost years in the future. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;We therefore wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t be surprised to see other sovereign nation states acquire bitcoin in 2022 and perhaps even see a central bank make an acquisition.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I did this a few times actually without  issues. It seemed as reliable as any exchange - pancake swap, 1inch,  uniswap,  raydium, etc...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The site was even verified by Haze crypto when I used it months ago, but it has since been updated and now warns of the site as a scam. I&amp;amp;#39;m unsure if  I&amp;amp;#39;m allowed to post the name of the exchange site, a mod can tell me if its ok. I actually hadn&amp;amp;#39;t even used the site this year.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The scammers were patient. They waited until the wallet had more funds in it than it did when first connected. Around $1400 BUSD worth.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How did it happen?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I found the transaction on bscscan and traced the wallet address back to the exchange site. I remembered using it once last year, but not much more. So I decided to create another wallet and conducted some tiny transactions to try to figure out how the scam worked.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is what I believe happened.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The wallet was connected to the exchange like any other. The exchange was audited and seemed legit. I performed tiny transaction of some BUSD and the approval request from Metamask appeared. Looking carefully, I noticed that the approval button was designed to approve THREE (3) transactions. One was the transacrtion I had made, but one of the other transactions was &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;an authorisation for the exchange to withdraw up to $100000000 BUSD!&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What the hell? I never noticed a transaction like that before. I checked my main Metamask and found the same type of authorisation last year. Shit. Somehow hidden among normal transactions I had approved a request to allow this exchange to withdraw funds whenever they fucking wanted. All they had to do was watch my wallet transactions and determine a point when they thought I currently had a lot more money than usual stored.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How to prevent in the future?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Naturally, I was concerned that I had conducted similar type transaction approval requests in the past, so I started to research how to check who/what else has access to my wallet. I fortunately fopund nothing else of concern. But I wanted to share how to check it for yourselves.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Firstly, Make sure that existing connected sites are accurate.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anything   you don&amp;amp;#39;t use anymore, or worse, don&amp;amp;#39;t recognise should be immediately   removed. This is easy to do. Open your wallet, click the three dots  and  select &amp;amp;#39;connected sites&amp;amp;#39;, browse through the list and revoke  anything  that you don&amp;amp;#39;t want.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Secondly, revoke any tokens. This is likely something very few people do.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;And this is how I got scammed.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For Ethereum Mainnet/Binance Smart Chain, visit the site token checker on ethscan/bscscan. Enter your ETH/BSC wallet address and browse though the list. Revoke anything you no longer use.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;EDIT:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thank you to all the people who DMd and thanked me for alerting them to the issue of token approval. Some people said they found dozens of connected sites and tokens that they hadn&amp;amp;#39;t touched in a very long time. I&amp;amp;#39;m grateful some people found my experience beneficial.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The mod said it was ok to post a screenshot. See below. The issue that I was trying to raise was not so much the site itself, but the ability for most sites to connect your token with unlimited access.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But still, no centralized exchange will ever be as bad as Facebook’s Meta.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I despise them. They steal our private info to sell to companies for ad targeting.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Watch how the market will start getting littered with ads (even ones unrelated to crypto) once Meta starts monopolizing the crypto space.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I think the only way to avoid this would be through allowing publishers to motorize without ads through users’ processing power. Networks like Gather are already doing that so lets hope this swerves away companies like Facebook and Google.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

This upgrade is set to change the entire fee market operations on the Ethereum network, as it will be bringing a discrete fee base that is burned instead of being paid to the miners, and an elimination to the first-price auction mechanism.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This upgrade won’t be having a direct impact on the gas fees, but it will be allowing the users to estimate the costs better.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Another main impact of this upgrade is that it’ll be having a deflationary impact on MATIC. Since Polygon’s total supply of tokens is fixed at 10 billion, the reduction of the token number will be having a direct deflationary impact on the asset. A we know, 0.27% of the total supply will be burned annually, which means 27 million MATIC. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This upgrade is going to have a positive impact on the dApps users, as they’ll be enjoying even lower fees, and developers will be receiving a boost as well. Not to forget that the EIP 1559 will also minimize the number of spam transactions and the network congestion. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Finally, will this upgrade have a direct impact on MATIC’s price?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

However, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/technology/quarter-small-businesses-across-nine-countries-plan-offer-crypto-payments-visa-2022-01-12/&quot;&amp;gt;research from Visa&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; shows that 2022 has even more in store for mainstream crypto adoption. In fact, a whopping 25% of small businesses in 9 different countries plan to start accepting crypto payments this year.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Companies exceed consumer expectations&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The survey was conducted among 2,250 small businesses in 9 different countries. These are the United States, Canada, Brazil, Singapore, Germany, Ireland, Russia, the United Arab Emirates and Hong Kong. Also, 1,000 Americans and 500 residents in each country were asked for their opinions. In doing so, the survey covers almost all continents and provides a nice picture of the average sentiment worldwide.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Visa reports that 25% of these 2,250 businesses plan to accept crypto payments by 2022. This is while among consumers, only 13% expect companies to do so. Jeni Mundy, global head of merchant sales at Visa, states that more trust seems to be emerging:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;I think more people are more confident in crypto,&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Interest in crypto especially outside North America&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Furthermore, the survey revealed that it is mainly companies outside North America that are interested in accepting crypto payments. In North America, only 19% (US) and 8% (Canada) say they have these plans. In the United Arab Emirates, Singapore, Hong Kong and Brazil, the percentage is as high as 30%. Even companies that do not want to accept crypto this year may change tack later. Indeed, the survey also shows that three-quarters of companies believe that expanding payment options is &amp;amp;quot;fundamental&amp;amp;quot; to their business growth. Mundy argues that it is a &amp;amp;quot;natural evolution&amp;amp;quot; to accept crypto over time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Visa happy with results&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The results will be music to Visa&amp;amp;#39;s ears. After all, the payments giant is betting big on crypto. Last year, for example, it launched a crypto consulting service. In addition, the company made a promise to continue supporting crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Kraken and Avanti are two entities active in Crypto business ,both have received permission under Wyoming law to become Special Purpose Depository Institutions(SDPI)-a new type of financial entity that can transact in Crypto while also performing traditional banking services. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After receiving SDPI charter from authorities,next step is to require a master account at Federal Reserve to arrange payments with Central Bank and conduct settlements with other financial institutions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But here comes the main problem, Federal Reserve blocked the applications to open the master account without any legitimate reasons.Not only this, Federal Reserve sat on SDPI applications for more than a year and has been slow to communicate with Crypto Banks on why the whole process is taking so much time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fed Chair Jerome Powell defending the FED&amp;amp;#39;s decision to block Crypto Banks with this statement &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;if we start granting these, there will be a couple hundred of them soon.They are hugely precedential, which is why I am taking my time on this&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Even though Mr. Jerome Powell agreed that there are good arguments for treating them as eligible to receive accounts.Just because it&amp;amp;#39;s &amp;amp;quot;Crypto Bank&amp;amp;quot; they can&amp;amp;#39;t get the permission for master account.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And people think authorities are now realizing the potential of Crypto and ready to accept it as a part of financial system.They are just saying nice words so that their public image remain intact, and their actions are in the direction to stop Crypto at any cost. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The lawsuit in itself is not concerning but when you connect the dots on who filed the lawsuit and the purpose behind it- you see that this is but a malicious attempt of ridiculing crypto by only emphasizing a small proportion of use case. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It’s slowly but surely happening and I already bought some DeFi alts like Curve cause I think its the best DeFi project and some BitDAO considering how much they’ve been investing in the DeFi space recently.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Price hit the Top of the Loga Channel in July 2011, Dec 2013 and the Dec 2017. From a historical perspective we can say that it needs around 4 years to hit the top. If this repeats, we will hit around 150.000 within the next months. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Article has some other nice calculations, take the deep dive:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Find the full blog post with all the tables&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-48&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;here&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Welcome to your monthly no-shill data dump: Here&amp;amp;#39;s the FOUR YEAR REPORT for the 2018 Top Ten Experiment featuring &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BTC, XRP, ETH, BCH, ADA, LTC, NEM, DASH, IOTA,&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Stellar.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;tl;dr&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;What&amp;amp;#39;s this all about?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven&amp;amp;#39;t sold or traded, reporting every single month for four years. Did the same in 2019, 2020, 2021, and more recently, the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2022/&quot;&amp;gt;2022 Top Ten a few weeks ago&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;here&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Snapshots taken on the 1st of each month.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;December&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Highlights:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; A bloody, all-red month&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Overall since Jan. 2018:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;ETH&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; solidly in the lead, followed by &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BTC&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;ADA.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;  After briefly pulling ahead earlier in the year, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;the 2018 Top Ten are now significantly underperforming the S&amp;amp;amp;P 500&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; over the same time period.  Q: So, big crypto fail, right?&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A: Only if I stopped after the first year.  The &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;2018+2019+2020+2021 Combined Top Ten Portfolios are returning 406%, much, much better than traditional markets over the same time period (&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;fancy new chart at the very bottom of the post).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Some exciting new changes for&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2022/&quot;&amp;gt;2022&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;!&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;ll focus on 2022 Top Ten Portfolio reports + one other portfolio on a rotating basis (down to two reports per month)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Incorporated Decentralized Finance (DeFi) for the first time. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Factoring in stablecoin gains:  In past years, I have not included the ROI that is possible with stables in the monthly reports.  This year, I will detail ways to build on the $100 of USDC in the 2022 portfolio and gamify it a bit: my goal is to outperform as many as the other cryptos in the 2022 Top Ten Portfolio as possible (simple if it turns out to be a bear year, a bit more challenging if the 2022 market moons).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Giveaways: Who doesn’t love a good old fashioned giveaway? I’ll be giving away crypto during the year, either through Twitter, Reddit, or my email list. I’m still figuring out the details, but aim to give away around $100 a month in crypto.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Friendly competition: I will compare my homemade 2022 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment to a Total Crypto Market Cap Index Token ($TCAP &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/TotalCryptoMarketCap&quot;&amp;gt;r/TotalCryptoMarketCap&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;) to see which one outperforms.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And here we go!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Four Year Report – UP 34%&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/c3c6wlctpgb81.jpg?width=1056&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=380248b14486edaa5749fba7a390198bf81260a0&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/c3c6wlctpgb81.jpg?width=1056&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=380248b14486edaa5749fba7a390198bf81260a0&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Welcome to the four year report!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Portfolio is &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BTC, XRP, ETH, BCH, ADA, LTC, IOTA, NEM, Dash,&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Stellar&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;December highlights for the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;100% red month&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;IOTA&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; falls the least, only down -4% (on news that staking on the Firefly wallet will yield two cryptos, Assembly and Shimmer).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;ETH&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; maintains a solid overall lead, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BTC&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; in second place, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;ADA&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; in third.  Three coins in the green since January 2018.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;After four years, the 2018 Portfolio is +34%, behind the S&amp;amp;amp;P 500’s ROI over the same time period.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;December Ranking and Dropouts&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here’s a look at the movement in ranks since January 2018:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/ulc9dwgvpgb81.jpg?width=412&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=2eadc9a98ec75b726cef37af7cb716fddf3126db&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/ulc9dwgvpgb81.jpg?width=412&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=2eadc9a98ec75b726cef37af7cb716fddf3126db&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Top Ten dropouts since January 2018:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; After four years of the 2018 Top Ten Experiment, only 40% of the cryptos that &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/&quot;&amp;gt;started in the Top Ten&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; have remained.  &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;NEM, Dash, Stellar, Bitcoin Cash, IOTA&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Litecoin&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; have been replaced by &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Binance Coin, Tether&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;DOT, SOL&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;LUNA&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;USDC.  NEM&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; looks like it wants to be the first to drop out of the Top 100.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;December Winners and Losers&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;December Winners&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; –  &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;IOTA&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; outperformed the pack, dropping only -4% this month. 100% of the cryptos in the red.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;December Losers&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; –   Losing nearly a third of its value, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Litecoin&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; fell the most, down -30%. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;NEM&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; followed &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;LTC&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, dropping -27% in December.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Tally of Monthly Winners and Losers&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After four years, here’s a tally of the monthly winners and losers over the life of the 2018 Top Ten Experiment. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/lisz7rgxpgb81.jpg?width=411&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=cbf41f94e9716f0140f3a7dfff3f655fa9d21a59&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/lisz7rgxpgb81.jpg?width=411&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=cbf41f94e9716f0140f3a7dfff3f655fa9d21a59&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With 11, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Bitcoin&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; has two more monthly wins than second place &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Cardano&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.  &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;NEM&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; has finished last place most often (12 months out of 48).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Bitcoin&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; is still the only cryptocurrency that hasn’t yet lost a month since January 2018 (although it has come very close a couple of times).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Overall Update –  2021 ends with a whimper. After four years, ETH in first place, and Dash and NEM tied for worst overall performance.&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After reaching an All Time High (+72%) in &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-46&quot;&amp;gt;October&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio continued to lose value.  After four years of holding these cryptos, only 3 out of the 10 cryptos are in the green: &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BTC,&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;ETH,&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;ADA.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Overall, first place &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;ETH&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; (+413%) is well ahead of &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BTC&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; (+257%) and third place &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;ADA&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; (+99%).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The initial $100 invested in first place &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;ETH&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; four years ago?  It’s worth $515 today.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;DASH&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;NEM&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; are virtually tied at the bottom, both down over -86% since &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/&quot;&amp;gt;January 2018&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;  The initial $100 invested in each four ago is worth about $13 today.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Total Market Cap for the entire cryptocurrency sector:&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/mldnsr7zpgb81.png?width=582&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=d82435bc0e39657707f2143fb5dd1951f6ddcfd1&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/mldnsr7zpgb81.png?width=582&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=d82435bc0e39657707f2143fb5dd1951f6ddcfd1&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;End of December 2021 market cap: &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$2,211,626,655,207&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The total crypto market dropped significantly in December.  Crypto as a sector is still up +285% since &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/&quot;&amp;gt;January 2018&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There was no easy way to achieve this at the time, but if you were able to capture the entire crypto market since New Year’s Day 2018, you’d be doing much, much better than the Experiment’s Top Ten approach (+34%), the return of the S&amp;amp;amp;P (+78%) over the same period of time, and nine of the individual cryptos within the 2018 Top Ten (except for &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Ethereum)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto Market Cap Low Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$114B in&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-thirteen/&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;January 2019&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto Market Cap High Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$2.65T in&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-46/&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;October 2021&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Bitcoin dominance:&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/qygnx0a0qgb81.png?width=487&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=567958cf7214839fa7befa749d61125dade6a9a8&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/qygnx0a0qgb81.png?width=487&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=567958cf7214839fa7befa749d61125dade6a9a8&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BitDom&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; declined a bit in December, ending the month at 40.2%.  When looking at the entire four year 2018 Experiment time frame, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BTC&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; dominance is near the low end.  For context:   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Low Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;33% in January 2018&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;High Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-twenty/&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;70.5% in August 2019&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2018: &amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/cxtd9lb1qgb81.jpg?width=339&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=25b3da0034194812e2b66f977450fff1555b48fb&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/cxtd9lb1qgb81.jpg?width=339&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=25b3da0034194812e2b66f977450fff1555b48fb&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The 2018 Top Ten Portfolio lost $325 in December.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If I decided to cash out the 2018 Top Ten Experiment today, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;the $1000 initial investment would be worth $1,341&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, up 34% from &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/&quot;&amp;gt;January 2018&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Green is unfamiliar territory for the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio and a recent development.  Over the first four years of the 2018 Index Fund Experiment, thirty-eight months have been in the red, with only ten months of green.  And all ten of the green months have come in 2021. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here’s a look at the ROI over the life of the experiment, month by month, since the beginning of the 2018 Experiment four years ago:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/cbumx113qgb81.jpg?width=654&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=7bba9861143359ff6b70ff0ca8e6ba75de5d00d6&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/cbumx113qgb81.jpg?width=654&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=7bba9861143359ff6b70ff0ca8e6ba75de5d00d6&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The all time high for this portfolio is &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-46&quot;&amp;gt;October 2021&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; (+72%).  The lowest point was in January 2019 when the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio was down &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-thirteen/&quot;&amp;gt;-88%&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Remember: no one can predict the value of any crypto tomorrow, let alone next month or next year.  The 2018 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio was down -88% after one year, -80% after two years, -25% after three years.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Alright, that’s that for the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment recap.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But I didn’t stop the Experiment in 2018:  I invested another $1000 in the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;2019&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;2020,&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;2021&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Top Ten Cryptos as well (&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;(and, just announced,&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2022/&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;again in 2022&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;!)&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.  How are the other Crypto Index Fund Experiments doing?    &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-48&quot;&amp;gt;2018 Top Ten Experiment&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;: up +34% (total value $1,341)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-36&quot;&amp;gt;2019 Top Ten Experiment:&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; up +504% (total value $6,044)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-24&quot;&amp;gt;2020 Top Ten Experiment&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;: up +795% (total value $8,951)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-12&quot;&amp;gt;2021 Top Ten Experiment&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;: up +292% (total value $3,921)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So overall? Taking the four portfolios together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;bottom&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; line: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;After a $4,000 investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; the combined portfolios are worth &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$20,257&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; ($1,341 + $6,044 + $8,951 + $3,921).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;That’s up +406%&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; on the combined portfolios, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;down from&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-47&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;last month’s all time high&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiments.  Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/xcl80o35qgb81.jpg?width=511&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e2cd4923360a5492259faf606b3649c893fd4b16&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/xcl80o35qgb81.jpg?width=511&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e2cd4923360a5492259faf606b3649c893fd4b16&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;That’s a +406% gain by investing $1k in whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for four years in a row.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Comparison to S&amp;amp;amp;P 500:&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I’m also tracking the S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 as part of the Experiment to have a comparison point with other popular investments options.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/3uss07c8qgb81.png?width=582&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=3e68ae4c88a82ff35b70538ec11dd137e83447e2&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/3uss07c8qgb81.png?width=582&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=3e68ae4c88a82ff35b70538ec11dd137e83447e2&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After four years: the S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 is up +78% since January 2018, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/&quot;&amp;gt;January 1st, 2018&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; would be worth $1,780 had it been redirected to the S&amp;amp;amp;P.  That’s more than double the +34% return of the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio over the same period of time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;$1000 investment in S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1,780 today&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;$1000 investment in S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1,900 today&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;$1000 investment in S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,480 today&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;$1000 investment in S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,270 today&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Taken together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;bottom&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; line for a similar approach with the S&amp;amp;amp;P: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;After four $1,000 investments into an S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, my portfolio would be worth $6,430&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; ($1,780 + $1,900 + $1,480 + $1,270)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That is up &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;+61%&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/&quot;&amp;gt;since January 2018&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; compared to a &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;+406%&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here’s a fancy new chart showing the four year ROI comparison between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&amp;amp;amp;P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/gnkxsud9qgb81.png?width=575&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=3f94a09a11a36620fca7b8630d615420049141b2&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/gnkxsud9qgb81.png?width=575&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=3f94a09a11a36620fca7b8630d615420049141b2&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Conclusion:&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Many thanks to the long-time Experiment followers, appreciate you taking the time to follow along over the years.  For those just getting into crypto, welcome! I hope these reports can somehow give you a taste of what you may be in for as you begin your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, think long term, don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose, and try to enjoy the ride! Feel free to reach out with any questions and stay tuned for monthly progress reports. Keep an eye out for my parallel projects where I repeat the experiment, purchasing another $1000 ($100 each) of new sets of Top Ten cryptos as of &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-36&quot;&amp;gt;January 1st, 2019&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-24&quot;&amp;gt;January 1st, 2020&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-12&quot;&amp;gt;January 1st, 2021&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, and most recently, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2022/&quot;&amp;gt;January 1st, 2022&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I also want to add that they are far from perfect, their app is so ridiculously slow and I hate that I have to use a mobile phone instead of a desktop, both drive me mad. Also I know it&amp;amp;#39;s not decentralised so a lot of the crypto &amp;amp;#39;purists&amp;amp;#39; are not going to like it (even though no crypto coin where you can just buy a controlling quantity with the only limitation being having enough money was never truly decentralised in my opinion).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That said I think they have structured their business model perfectly towards the average person:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;1) You need to have almost zero knowledge to buy CRO and stake it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;2) Their pre paid debit card is the best bridge I&amp;amp;#39;ve seen so far between fiat and crypto, you just spend your fiat and get crypto in return. It doesn&amp;amp;#39;t require all the world&amp;amp;#39;s companies to change their payment systems and pricing structure. Everything stays in fiat and the user gets the reward. Also it looks super cool and makes people want to show it off.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;3) Their daily missions encourage a repeating $20 daily DCA which is perfect for teaching new investors to put in gradually and repeatedly rather than dumping a 4/5 digit lump sum all in on one price point, often near ATHs.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;4) They offer decent staking rewards although you do need a large bag of CRO to access it which I feel is a bit off-putting.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;5) They are doing real marketing, buying stadiums and paying Matt Damon to be in their adverts. Compare that to someone like LRC who also have a fait on ramp and wallet system and their marketing consists of a guy posting laser eye memes on twitter and discord and saying things like &amp;amp;quot;WAGMI&amp;amp;quot;. I know Matt Damon was just paid to be in an advert but I still trust any company that can actually afford to hire him far more than a company that cannot / will not spend that money.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;6) The coin price point is something that retail can understand, it&amp;amp;#39;s not a scary large number like BTC but it&amp;amp;#39;s also not 6 0s after a decimal like a lot of shitcoins.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;7) Their model is built around buying and holding their coin for other rewards which is, again, great at teaching retail to HODL rather than the only means of value to try and sell at a higher price point that pretty much the rest of the crypto market exists on.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I started in 2017 and saw my portfolio plummet to next to nothing after the big pump we all know.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I was in debts but I made it anyway and reloaded when the price was at its lowest during 2018/2019. Most were calling for the final death of crypto and a few saw a huge opportunity.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you become wealthy one day and they call you lucky, tell them it’s not about luck but you’re simply not the kind that gives up easily mostly when you have convictions about something.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Only 1% of the worldwide population uses crypto, we are still early and there’s still plenty opportunities to become &amp;amp;quot;lucky&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
