And on a long enough timescale there’s a good chance 80-90 percent of the current coins will be dead. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But if you had to put money on it, which one would are you certain will be dead by the next decade? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My choice is Solana, because whilst tech teething issues are part of the process, I don’t see them holding their shit together long enough to provide a safe alternative to other alt coins and Eth, regardless of how fast they are. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Knowing my luck, they’ll be worth 100k in 2030. But oh well.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Before youtube removed dislikes, we could understand if a video is legit or scam by it&amp;amp;#39;s dislike ratio. Now it has become impossible to determine. Now you need to be 10x more careful of possible scam videos on youtube.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Don&amp;amp;#39;t trust the videos from the channels that you are not familiar with. I think youtube gave an amazing opportunity to scammers by removing dislikes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Youtube removing dislikes aslo shows us the importance of decentralization.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;You&amp;amp;#39;re not gonna make it in crypto unless you know the bullshit &amp;amp;amp; secrets that go on beyond the scenes. In this thread i will tell you what you need to know. You may not like it, but it&amp;amp;#39;s important if you want to level up.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;INTRODUCTION&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Forget everything you think you know about cryptocurrency. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You need to realise crypto is a game. A game where, most likely, you will lose. A game filled with players with more experience than yourself. Players with far more influence, connection and often skill. The inconvenient truth is we aren’t all ‘gonna make it’ &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Beyond Bitcoin &amp;amp;amp; some credible projects there are countless failed ones. Some projects have good intentions but are grossly overvalued. Others are quite simply scams &amp;amp;amp; money grabs.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But before you get angry at me &amp;amp;amp; stop reading. Before you heckle ‘FUD’ or ‘You’re Not Gonna Make It’. Let me explain myself.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yes crypto is filled with scams &amp;amp;amp; scammers, but there is big money to be made. But only IF you understand how the rules of this game work &amp;amp;amp; how to play it successfully. At the moment  many of you are playing the game blindfolded. Giving others the upperhand. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That&amp;amp;#39;s why for this first post I will pull back the curtain. And reveal the rules of the game. The rules many don’t want you to know. If you’ve been in the game for a while you may know some of them. If you’re new, read it twice and let it all sink in.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Why am I doing this? Why am I revealing these secrets? Because before I teach you anything you need to know how this game works. You need to know these rules if you want to have a chance at actually winning. Because if you want to win this game, you must first know how it is played.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So you have two choices in front of you, do you want to learn the truth &amp;amp;amp; get better.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Or do you want to carry on, hopiuming for the best&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;THE FIVE SECRET RULES&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;1 BE WARY OF INFLUENCERS&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyone who has been in crypto for more than six months will likely be aware of the first rule. Many of you will have been wrecked by a big YouTube influencer, who shilled you some random alt coin. You were told it would x100, you aped in &amp;amp;amp; now it&amp;amp;#39;s down 80%. Don’t be embarrassed or ashamed of this. To tell you the truth the same happened to me. In fact it was the best thing that ever happened to me. It taught me to actually do my own research, think for myself &amp;amp;amp; find good people to teach me.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yes there are good people in this crypto game (i’ll share some at the bottom of this article) but you need to understand many are not your friend &amp;amp;amp; they don’t care about your bags. The problem is actually much bigger than you realize too. Many of the biggest YouTube influencers collude together in private telegram groups. They work together to hunt coins with a low market cap &amp;amp;amp; volume, ones that can easily be pumped (and then dumped) in price. They work together to cut deals on new crypto projects and ensure their bags get filled before anyone else. Only to dump on their ‘fans’ down the line. Do you think it’s a confidence that MoonCarl worked with BitBoy, Crypto Banter, MM Crypto &amp;amp;amp; Lark Davies to shill Kasta? I think not.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“But influencer xx is different &amp;amp;#39;&amp;amp;#39; I hear you cry. Well maybe you got lucky &amp;amp;amp; found a good one. Yet even then, you need to be careful. Because if the person has millions of followers on YouTube they may still invertedly pump the price, as their followers ape in. Like it or not, you need to be weary of big YouTube influencers. They aren’t your friend &amp;amp;amp; they don’t care about your god damn bags.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;2 BE CAUTIOUS OF BAD PROJECTS&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some projects will ‘make it’ &amp;amp;amp; usher in a new store value (Bitcoin), Economies (L1s), Defi, gaming (Play2Earn) &amp;amp;amp; digital ownership (NFTs). However most projects won&amp;amp;#39;t. Some projects will have good intentions and create a token to fund an exciting vision. But even then you have to ask the question…if the idea is so good &amp;amp;amp; so financially lucrative, why are they willing to give up so much equity? Would you give up guaranteed money in a lucrative project? I think not. Yes some are committed to a decentralized future but they are few and far between.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Much worse is a bunch of less honorable ‘founders’ and ‘VCs’ that spotted an opportunity for a quick cash grab. These folks, mainly from a sales background, realized pretty quickly that they could get very rich (with very little effort) by doing an ICO and marketing the hell out of it. Their primary business objective isn’t to build a decentralized future, it’s simply to market the hell out of a project and dump their bags on newbies. You need to tell who are the “good” VCs and who are the “bad ones”.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now all of this doesn&amp;amp;#39;t mean you can’t make good money on bad projects, some people made millions off them. But I think you need to be aware of what is going on here, so you can plan your strategy accordingly. Next week I will go into more detail on the strategy I take on finding altcoins and managing risk.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;3 DON&amp;amp;#39;T JOIN A CULT&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Perhaps one of the most dangerous aspects in crypto is the cult. It starts out innocently enough. A friend or someone you respect shills you a crypto project. You decide to read up on it via their website and whitepaper. You begin to follow the project on Twitter and join the Discord &amp;amp;amp; Telegram groups. But this is where the problems start. Because the deeper you go into a project &amp;amp;amp; the more involved you feel, the more dangerous it becomes. You are led to believe you are in a ‘community’ &amp;amp;amp; that you are all ‘gonna make it&amp;amp;#39;, when in fact you are joining a cult.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cult’s are incredibly dangerous in crypto, because they remove your objectivity &amp;amp;amp; critical thinking on a project. You&amp;amp;#39;re surrounded by people in Telegram groups &amp;amp;amp; Discords, who all hold the same biased belief system. And these belief systems &amp;amp;amp; subsequent emotions are amplified ten fold, because money is involved. Think about it, no one is going to doubt their own project when they have so much money invested.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You see cult members everywhere. They are your friends in whatsapp groups, desperately trying to shill you a coin they aped into. They are those random people on Twitter trying to constantly push a project onto you. Everyday I get so many requests to buy project ‘x’ or ‘x to the moon’ but i will never listen. I will always form my own strategy (which will change with time &amp;amp;amp; research) and evaluate accordingly. Some of you may not like my bluntness, but I am not here to tell you what you want to hear or sugar coat it. I want to help you &amp;amp;amp; tell you the truth.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In short, it’s essential you do four things:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Form your own strategy based on research (and always be willing to change it).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Don’t become a cult member, always be objective.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Don’t fall for random shills everyone is talking about.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Don’t listen to people who only believe in one project &amp;amp;amp; refuse to change their hypothesis.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;4 DONT HODL&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;HODL right? That&amp;amp;#39;s what we are told to do. Just HOLD and we are all going to make it. Nope. Outside of Bitcoin and maybe Etherum, you cannot blindly HODL a project. There is no guarantee it is going to make it or that it will be around in the next five years. The altcoin space is incredibly volatile, which is great for exponential gains but can also get you wrecked if you blindly hold onto your bags.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You need to stop falling in love with a project. Oh ‘but the tech is so good’ or ‘the founder is a genius’ I hear you cry. I really don’t care. You need to stop holding your bags for years and take profits when you can. Taking profits is not only essential to de-risk yourself, it is also a great way to release capital to invest in other projects. I recently wrote a thread on taking profits, which seemed to be popular, which you can read below.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;5 STACK BLUE CHIPS&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As I have said earlier, most altcoins won’t make it. Even if they run up x5 or x10 this bull run there is still a chance they could run to zero in the next bear market. Whether you like it or not, your primary objective should be to use the altcoins to increase your gains, take profits and layer into ‘less volatile’ projects like Bitcoin. For all the talk of ‘Bitcoin is a boomer coin’ the fact is, it is the project that has been around the longest and the one which almost certainly won’t fail. And let&amp;amp;#39;s be honest if someone offered you fifty Bitcoin, would you really say no?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Again many of you won’t like this point of view, but again i am not here to sugar coat things. The crypto game is tough and I want to help you by telling you the truth.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;CONCLUSION&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you made it this far, I salute you. Many will have got angry at the truths I laid out. Others may have become disillusioned that the whole game is rigged and there is no hope of winning. But this is not the case at all. As I mentioned at the beginning of this article you first need to know the rules of the game, if you want a chance to win it. This first article is essential because it sets the ground rules of what to avoid &amp;amp;amp; what to do; be weary of big influencers, don’t join a cult, don’t HODL alts &amp;amp;amp; always stack blue chips (Bitcoin).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now we have these rules in place, and truths exposed, we can begin to build our own strategy and figure out how to play this game better.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thank you for reading!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I have been in this space for over two years and learned about scams EARLY on, but just today I saw an advertised live chat between two well known crypto people and clicked it, saw 9k &amp;amp;#39;other people&amp;amp;#39; watching, was like wow, sent it to my friend but then thought, oh right, that channel logo was the wrong color, silly me.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now imagine a novice. People are surprised when they hear about people falling for these but &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;scams are getting more creative and realistic every passing month&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;! No one is immune. I search crypto topics and click websites and my MetaMask pops up like HELLLlloo! and I immediately exit out of the site; but imagine and UNDERSTAND that many people would just sign in without second thought.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;YouTube Live crypto scams netted $8m+ in October 2021 alone. Scammers posing as Michael Saylor have stolen over $1m+ in Bitcoin via YouTube in one go. The value of scamming is increasing and YouTube is doing LITTLE to solve this issue. ChainAlysis says Indians visited crypto scam websites 9.6 million times in 2021. YouTube comments with WhatsApp and Telegram numbers left by scammers to call and obtain your property. Accounts made by bots to host only this junk. YOUTUBE IS DOING LITTLE ABOUT THIS. All articles are just about &amp;amp;quot;raising awareness&amp;amp;quot; but not about waht they are going to do to stop this from continuing.   Try and searching &amp;amp;#39;YouTube&amp;amp;#39; online to research this topic without getting just a list of their videos. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://bitcoinist.com/youtube-crypto-scams-on-the-rise-as-victims-lose-millions/&quot;&amp;gt;There was an article two months ago,&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; but it says NOTHING about YouTubes responsibility in this and I haven&amp;amp;#39;t heard/found much since. There are ways the platform could be ramping up and stopping this type of crap but they take little to no responsibility.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The largest Dogecoin wallet, which currently holds $5 Billion in Doge of its $21 Billion market cap is very mysterious. It was thought to be Robinhood or some other exchange but that has previously been dismissed by the Robinhood CEO himself.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Any wallet that holds over 23.17% of the current supply has more than enough to rug pull an entire coin to near zero. Even half of that can cause the price to crash to unrecoverable levels due to how liquidity and market caps work.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For new cryptocurrencies, if the top 10 wallets hold &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;more than 20% of the&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; token, or worse, a large percentage of the token is held in a single wallet, then this is a dangerous sign of a potential rug pull.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;For Doge, the top 14 wallets own  46.11% of all Dogecoin.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TLDR: Avoid any Cryptocurrency that has wallets capable of rug pulling the entire project. Don&amp;amp;#39;t let a false sense of security take over just because Doge is popular. It still does not make Doge immune to rugpulls. Never let yourself be at the mercy of a single wallet.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;EDIT: The amount of people on the comments claiming it to be the Robinhood wallet DESPITE Robinhood&amp;amp;#39;s CEO publicly stating the company does not hold that much Doge as far back as May is the same argument Shib shillers make. It is careless copium. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketwatch.com/story/a-25-billion-dogecoin-whale-lurks-but-robinhood-ceo-says-we-dont-have-significant-positions-in-any-of-the-coins-we-keep-11620326508&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.marketwatch.com/story/a-25-billion-dogecoin-whale-lurks-but-robinhood-ceo-says-we-dont-have-significant-positions-in-any-of-the-coins-we-keep-11620326508&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Moreover the fact that some people find safety in a company like Robinhood is just stupid. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

At this years conference Intel is set to outline a new &amp;amp;quot;Bonanza Mine&amp;amp;quot; processor, a new chip described as an &amp;amp;quot;ultra-low-voltage energy-efficient Bitcoin mining ASIC.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This means that they will soon compete with the likes of Bitmain in the market for specialized ASICs for Bitcoin mining.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Last year Intel&amp;amp;#39;s Systems and Graphics Architect, Senior Vice President and GM Raja Koduri said this about crypto mining:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;“Being able to do much more efficient blockchain validation at a much lower cost, much lower power, is a pretty solvable problem. And you know, we are working on that, and at some point in time, hopefully not too far into the future, we will kinda share some interesting hardware for that.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We will know more details after the presentation on 23rd February, 2022.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;The full blog post with all the tables is&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-36&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;here&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Welcome! This is the monthly report for my homemade 2019 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund. This group contains &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BTC, XRP, ETH, BCH, EOS, XLM, USDT, LTC, BSV&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Tron.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;tl;dr:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;What&amp;amp;#39;s this all about?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, no selling or trading, reporting monthly for 4 years. Did the same in 2019, 2020, 2021, then again into the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2022/&quot;&amp;gt;2022 Top Ten a few weeks ago&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Learn more about the history, rules, and FAQs of the Experiments (including the answer to the &amp;amp;quot;WHY TETHER?!?!&amp;amp;quot; question)&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;here&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Snapshots taken on the 1st of each month.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;THREE YEAR UPDATE (since Jan. 2019):&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;ETH&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; more than double second place &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BTC&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; (+1,408).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;2019 Top Ten Portfolio up &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;+504%, all coins in the green.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Total market &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;+1,638%&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; over same time period.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;2018+2019+2020+2021 Combined Top Ten Portfolios are returning +406%.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Some exciting new changes for&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2022/&quot;&amp;gt;2022&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;!&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Less spamming the sub with data (down to two reports/month)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Incorporated Decentralized Finance (DeFi) for the first time.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Factoring in stablecoin gains&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;: In the past, I have not included ROI that is possible with stables in the monthly reports. This year, I will detail ways to build on the $100 of USDC in the 2022 portfolio and gamify it a bit: my goal is to outperform as many as the other cryptos in the 2022 Top Ten Portfolio as possible (simple if it turns out to be a bear year, a bit more challenging if the 2022 market moons).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Giveaways: I’ll be giving away crypto during the year, either through Twitter, Reddit, or my email list. I’m still figuring out the details, but aim to give away around $100 a month in crypto.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Friendly competition (or Battle Royale?): I will compare my homemade 2022 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment to a Total Crypto Market Cap Index Token ($TCAP &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://np.reddit.com/r/TotalCryptoMarketCap/&quot;&amp;gt;r/TotalCryptoMarketCap&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;) to see which one outperforms.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On to the report!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Three Year Report – UP 504%  &amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/xu1n8ddlxfc81.png?width=1053&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=7ef47eaab6e80e5674bf779c66fa243d7ab2d6da&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/xu1n8ddlxfc81.png?width=1053&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=7ef47eaab6e80e5674bf779c66fa243d7ab2d6da&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The 2019 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund consists of: &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BTC, XRP, ETH, BCH, EOS, Stellar, USDT, Litecoin, BSV,&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Tron&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;December highlights for the 2019 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A very bloody December&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Ethereum&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; in the overall lead, up +&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;2,608%&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; since January 2019, more than double the ROI of second place &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Bitcoin&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;After three years, the 2019 Portfolio is &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;+504%&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;December Ranking and Dropout Report&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here’s the difference in rank since January 2018:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/uwm00uhmxfc81.png?width=409&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=ebc8d1d4c192ea163f5ab57763d5b1fb2c29e30f&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/uwm00uhmxfc81.png?width=409&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=ebc8d1d4c192ea163f5ab57763d5b1fb2c29e30f&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Top Ten dropouts since January 2019:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; After three years, 60% of the cryptos that &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-one/&quot;&amp;gt;started in the Top Ten in January 2019&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;  have been knocked out.  &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;EOS&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Litecoin, BSV, Stellar, Bitcoin Cash,&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Tron&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; have been replaced by &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Binance Coin, Cardano&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;DOT, SOL&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Luna,&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;USDC.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BSV&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; has fallen the furthest so far (#61) – it is the only crypto that has dropped out of the Top &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Sixty&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;December Winners and Losers&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;December Winners&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; – None, except stablecoin &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Tether&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;December Losers&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; –  &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Litecoin&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; had a tough month, losing nearly one third of its value.  &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;EOS&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; was the second worst performing crypto in the portfolio, down -24% in December.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Tally of Monthly Winners and Losers&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Which crypto holds the most wins or losses over the life of the project?  Here’s a snapshot of the winners and losers over the first three years of the 2019 Top Ten Experiment:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/d41uq71oxfc81.png?width=411&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=a0313ca9aea4e29a41b1997375a5d0ef8d8fc8c2&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/d41uq71oxfc81.png?width=411&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=a0313ca9aea4e29a41b1997375a5d0ef8d8fc8c2&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;By a large margin, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Tether&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; has the greatest number of monthly victories (11) followed by &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;ETH&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; with six.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Every crypto has won at least one month since &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-one/&quot;&amp;gt;January 2019&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BSV&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;USDT&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; have the most losses, 11 each (out of 36 months).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Three Year Update –  ETH easily outperforms its peers, 100% of cryptos in positive territory, EOS worst performing non-stablecoin&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;ETH&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; (+2,608%) is far and away the best performer of this group, more than doubling the ROI of second place &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BTC&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; (+1,144%) over the same period of time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The $100 investment into first place ETH on&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-one/&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;January 1st, 2019&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;is currently worth $2,779.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After three years, 100% of the cryptos in the 2019 Top Ten Portfolio are in positive territory. Not counting stablecoin &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Tether&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, the worst performing crypto is &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;EOS&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, up +18%.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Total Market Cap for the Entire Cryptocurrency Sector:&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/1zr7fl6qxfc81.png?width=582&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=d6893ac17146f4abc52ce9297f9547f63f6c2548&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/1zr7fl6qxfc81.png?width=582&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=d6893ac17146f4abc52ce9297f9547f63f6c2548&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The entire cryptocurrency sector is up +1,638% since &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-one/&quot;&amp;gt;January 2019&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.  This is still well behind first place &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;ETH&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; (2,608%) but much better than the rest of the Top Ten cryptos, including second place &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Bitcoin&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; (+1,144%).  And the total market is performing much better than the Top Ten approach (+504%).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Translation: unless you went all in on &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;ETH&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; or &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Bitcoin&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; three years ago, you were better off diversifying, and much better off if you had captured the gains of the entire crypto market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Top Ten approach has beaten every individual crypto except &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;ETH&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Bitcoin.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto Market Cap Low Point in the 2019 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$114B in&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-one/&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;January 2019&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto Market Cap High Point in the 2019 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$2.65T in&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-34&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;October 2021&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Bitcoin Dominance:&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/p4vy7d1rxfc81.png?width=472&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=ca43c6ecad8a54496045dcedadb0c410a5f9061c&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/p4vy7d1rxfc81.png?width=472&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=ca43c6ecad8a54496045dcedadb0c410a5f9061c&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BitDom&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; dipped in December, ending the month at 40.2%. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;This is a new low for the 2019 Top Ten Experiment.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For context, here are the high and low points of &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BTC&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; domination over the life of the 2019 Experiment:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Low Point in the 2019 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-36&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;40.2% this month&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;High Point in the 2019 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-eight/&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;70.5% in August 2019&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2019:&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/v2sbj97sxfc81.png?width=334&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=bde4010e6f5f58e80820b73502c2fc61cd3efe18&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/v2sbj97sxfc81.png?width=334&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=bde4010e6f5f58e80820b73502c2fc61cd3efe18&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The 2019 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio lost $1,604 in December.  After three years, the value of the initial $1000 investment is &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$6,044&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, up +504%. This is down from &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-35&quot;&amp;gt;last month’s all time high&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; for the 2019 Portfolio. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Below is a table summarizing the monthly ROI over the life of the 2019 Top Ten Index Fund experiments, providing a pretty good sense of the journey up to this point:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/7g2uxemtxfc81.png?width=475&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=5ad095753e9e457d97fcc202836221490ac8dfab&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/7g2uxemtxfc81.png?width=475&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=5ad095753e9e457d97fcc202836221490ac8dfab&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fairly steady upward movements punctuated by massive dips.  During the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-15/&quot;&amp;gt;Zombie Apocalypse&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; in March 2020, for example, the 2019 Top Ten Portfolio was returning only +6%. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Although the 2019 Top Ten Portfolio is up an impressive +504%, it is still a distant second place behind the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-24&quot;&amp;gt;2020 Top Ten Portfolio&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; which is up +795%.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Speaking of other Top Ten Portfolios, let’s put them all together now:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-48&quot;&amp;gt;2018 Top Ten Experiment&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;: up +34% (total value $1,341)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-36&quot;&amp;gt;2019 Top Ten Experiment&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;: up +504% (total value $6,044)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-24&quot;&amp;gt;2020 Top Ten Experiment&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;: up +795% (total value $8,951)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-12&quot;&amp;gt;2021 Top Ten Experiment:&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; up +292% (total value $3,921)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So overall? Taking the four portfolios together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;bottom&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; line: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;After a $4,000 investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; the combined portfolios are worth &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$20,257&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; ($1,341 + $6,044 + $8,951 + $3,921).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;That’s up +406%&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; on the combined portfolios, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;down from&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-35&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;last month’s all time high&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; for the Top Ten Index Fund Experiments.  Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking it in January 2020:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/gjq4nttuxfc81.jpg?width=511&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=65ab5ab731774c7085105e43e0e1385d3196accb&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/gjq4nttuxfc81.jpg?width=511&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=65ab5ab731774c7085105e43e0e1385d3196accb&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In summary: &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;That’s a +406% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for four straight years&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Comparison to S&amp;amp;amp;P 500:&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I’m also tracking the S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 as part of the experiments to have a comparison point with traditional markets. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/51iqwsvvxfc81.png?width=542&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=c29cbcda9723f782bddc351dc10e43b940136129&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/51iqwsvvxfc81.png?width=542&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=c29cbcda9723f782bddc351dc10e43b940136129&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Because the S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 Index is up 90% since January 2019, the initial $1k investment I put into crypto three years ago would be worth $1,900 had it been redirected to the S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 in January 2019. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But what if I took the same world’s-slowest-dollar-cost-averaging $1,000-per-year-on-January-1st-Crypto-Index-Fund-Experiment approach with the S&amp;amp;amp;P 500? It would yield the following:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;$1000 investment in S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1,780 today&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;$1000 investment in S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1,900 today&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;$1000 investment in S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,480 today&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;$1000 investment in S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,270 today&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Taken together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;bottom&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; line for a similar approach with the S&amp;amp;amp;P: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;After four $1,000 investments into an S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, my portfolio would be worth $6,430&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; ($1,780 + $1,900 + $1,480 + $1,270).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That is up &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;+61%&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/&quot;&amp;gt;since January 2018&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; compared to a &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;+406%&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here’s a table providing an overview of the four year ROI comparison between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&amp;amp;amp;P: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/pfynpqtwxfc81.png?width=575&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=d7bf73fba4427a3d03c02fd5391a69efabce1e1b&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/pfynpqtwxfc81.png?width=575&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=d7bf73fba4427a3d03c02fd5391a69efabce1e1b&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Conclusion:&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To both old-timers and newcomers: thanks so much for taking the time to read and for supporting the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments. I hope you find the updates helpful in terms of perspective as you navigate the crypto landscape.  Be careful out there and don’t put your mental, physical, or financial health at risk chasing gainz. If crypto is causing you to lose sleep at night, chances are you have too much in crypto: try to think long term and don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose. Feel free to reach out with any questions and stay tuned for progress reports.

Using native wallets, staking, airdrops, cold storage, etc is all great. But if you are trading in the hundreds, or even in the thousands....you really don&amp;amp;#39;t need to worry about all that.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Between gas fees, human error, scams, and hackers, you will likely be better off just trading on an exchange, and there is nothing wrong with that.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This community tends to hate on exchanges (not your keys, not your coins), but they do have legitimate use for the large majority of retail users who are just trying to throw a bit of extra cash into some investments. You don&amp;amp;#39;t need to panic if you have $500 of BTC on an exchange because you &amp;amp;quot;don&amp;amp;#39;t own the keys&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As long as you are using reputable companies like Coinbase and CDC (not you, Binance), you are not likely to have any issues.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I found the scammers wallet address and found that the scammer has received a whooping total of 87 BTC(Worth a total of 3.6 mil).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/zvt7kv9u2gc81.jpg?width=1280&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=989bf9aa6db66fbbc249eb9b94544d65cad4fdd8&quot;&amp;gt;His bitcoin address has been reported on scam alert. &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This person managed to earn 3.6mil dollars from a YouTube live video. This money is enough for someone to retire and live a happy life and falling for such a petty scam is stupidity at its finest. Now there is one very happy Nigerian prince out there. Doing almost nothing for a cool 3.6 million dollars.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I have decided to do research on tools that can be used to not fall for these scams. I will make a post on what these scams look like, what you can do to make other people aware and not fall for these yourself. It may not be perfect but I will try. I can use all the help I can get. There is no one out there who will double your money willingly.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit:- Thanks for the awards. I have made a promise and intend to keep it. If you guys have any suggestions please do DM me.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Then it goes to 40K and they say: Oh it&amp;amp;#39;s going to 30K. When it goes to 30K, I&amp;amp;#39;ll go all in!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then it reaches 30K and they hope for 10K.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The opposite also happens, with people saying: When Bitcoin reaches 50K, I&amp;amp;#39;ll take profits. Then it reaches 50K and you wait for 60K to take profits. Then 70K.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The thing is, Bitcoin has been at or below 10K &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;for a decade&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, why didn&amp;amp;#39;t you go all in then? Maybe 40K is the lowest we ever go, who knows. But if you wanted to buy at 40K when we were at 60K, then buy at 40K.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Many people say: When we get a bear market, then I&amp;amp;#39;ll buy! But it&amp;amp;#39;s kinda like: When it&amp;amp;#39;s 2023, then I&amp;amp;#39;ll start losing weight!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I know there are exceptions and I know some people are very disciplined in their crypto goals. I know 100 people are going to reply to this: &amp;amp;quot;Just DCA and HODL&amp;amp;quot;. Yes, that&amp;amp;#39;s fine, as long as you continue doing that during the bear market, and don&amp;amp;#39;t capitulate then.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;So if you were hoping for 40K when we were at 60K, don&amp;amp;#39;t hope for 20K now, then you&amp;amp;#39;ll never buy.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I say this from the perspective of the average user.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How to explain to a newcomer who wants to buy, say, an ERC-20 token that he has to pay hundreds of dollars to perform ordinary transactions. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And then the newcomer needs to be explained that a fee that can cost him hundreds of dollars can be lost forever if the transaction fails. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cryptocurrencies should make our finances easier, not harder. And I&amp;amp;#39;m sorry to say this, but I think that with ETH 2.0, the fees will also be incredibly expensive. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the real world, people aren’t used to paying that much for everyday transactions. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How do you even start researching and trading ETH if you are from some country where salary is less than the fee that we need to pay?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The vision of the crypto future should be cheap, nobody wants to pay a few hundred to enjoy that freedom.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;ve created a resource that details interest rates paid on almost 200 different coins by some of the leading exchanges, lenders, and wallets. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you&amp;amp;#39;re familiar with earning a yield on your coins, jump to the end of this post for the link.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you&amp;amp;#39;re not familiar with earning a yield on your coins, I&amp;amp;#39;m about to turn your world upside down! If you didn&amp;amp;#39;t already know, there are a number of companies out there who will pay in-kind interest on your coins for doing nothing other than holding them on their platform. In-kind interest is one of the easiest ways to compound your investment and see exponential returns! So not only will you be earning interest on your coins while you wait for the price to moon, the interest you earn along the way will moon right along with it!!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Don&amp;amp;#39;t take my word for it. Give it a go. Lower you average purchase price. Fatten your bags while you sleep. Stack your coins regardless of bear or bull or crab or shark or tadpole or beaver or flightless bird cycle. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyway, here is my &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vpBQI2DFUk7zXS4TCs9ZOnatvWHiYf5jHjKgKpfJG5Y/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&amp;gt;Interest Rates Comparison Tool&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; for you to use, free of charge. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you have any questions about earning interest on your coins, questions about any of the platforms featured in this tool, questions about this tool, or really just crypto questions in general, I&amp;amp;#39;m more than happy to talk through them with you!

Those who followed their original strategy and didn&amp;amp;#39;t panic, were the ones who eventually got the most out of the market. People that panic not only leave the market with  losses, they kill off future potential gains too.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Meanwhile, people that accumulate during dips are usually the ones to reap the maximum benefits when the market eventually recovers. I&amp;amp;#39;ve seen this first hand after the May crash. Most people lost faith and left the market in a loss thinking this was the end of the cycle, while those who accumulated reaped all the benefits after the market pumped late July.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you area newbie  investing into Crypto, never give up. The market will never go up in a straight like and there will always be significant dips along the way. The best thing to do in a bearish market right now is to accumulate for the next pump, because when it does, people like you who stuck around during the bad times will be the ones with the most gains.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And in case you didn&amp;amp;#39;t notice:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&quot;md-spoiler-text&quot;&amp;gt;It is 2022.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&quot;md-spoiler-text&quot;&amp;gt;Bitcoin did in fact NOT hit even close to $100k.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That doesn&amp;amp;#39;t mean that the market won&amp;amp;#39;t go down of course, it very likely could go down further. It also could start pumping and if you don&amp;amp;#39;t continue to DCA you&amp;amp;#39;ll miss the chance to average down those ATH buy in prices you probably entered the market with. The market is already almost 50% down, even if it dips further this is still a great price point to be buying in on almost all coins in terms of risk / reward.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The point is that take two massive piles of table salt whenever anyone tries to tell you they are anything other than &amp;amp;#39;guessing&amp;amp;#39; what the market is going to do. Ignore all the &amp;amp;#39;TA&amp;amp;#39; and the graphs and the political rumours and hearsay and don&amp;amp;#39;t worry about the stock markets. They have been telling me that the stock markets are about to crash any day now for over a year and the FTSE just keeps on reaching new post-COVID highs.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So invest wisely and DO research and make informed opinions but also filter out the doomsayers and the market crash predicters.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here is my pro tip for all of you. I made lots of trades, lots. Not only did I do that, I used mutiple exchanges and even more wallets. So my transaction count is quite high. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here is the real bear though. When you sit here and import everything into your coin tracker of choice (Koinly here), everything may not be there. I spent the last two days trying different platforms and importing API’s. Nothing seemed to work. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thankfully, I keep records of everything and was able link everything up manually over about six hours. Needless to say, dont be me. Being more of a minimalist when it comes to exchanges and wallets is by far the way to go. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Lastly, Fuck Uncle Sam and capital gains…&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

What even is money if it can come and go so easily? Crypto is so relentless in how volatile it is, sometimes you wonder if you&amp;amp;#39;ll wake up and be more successful than you ever could imagine.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Does anyone else relate? I got back into this ages ago, and I&amp;amp;#39;ve gotten so used to the market, I don&amp;amp;#39;t even care when I see my money fluctuate that much.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s amazing that it can be like that, I never thought I would see my income streams be that worthless but exciting at the same time. It&amp;amp;#39;s truly exciting but at the same time as of late I&amp;amp;#39;ve learned to check out since we&amp;amp;#39;ve been on a downtrend. My main holdings are in alts so I&amp;amp;#39;m seeing more volatile movement, I&amp;amp;#39;m really big on LUNA and AVAX- I think they are extremely promising projects, I also love Ethereum for obvious reasons like Smart Contracts.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I can&amp;amp;#39;t even imagine people who wake up each day and lose or gain 1 mil, 5 mil... and to think it&amp;amp;#39;s just perspective.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As we know the Crypto markets and BTC/USDT have been in a clear downtrend for the past few weeks, 10 weeks to be precise. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/ee3rw5rjhac81.png?width=871&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=4624d564ca358a1b8591917d4aa9070eb064c0c9&quot;&amp;gt;BTC/USDT | Binance | Heikin Ashi Candles&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In this chart we can clearly see the downward trending regression, with a Pearson&amp;amp;#39;s R of over 90%, meaning that the regression is a fairly accurate measure in this context. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the past when Bitcoin went below the Bull Market Support Band (&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tradingview.com/script/uSBR7cFa-Bull-Market-Support-Band-20w-SMA-21w-EMA/&quot;&amp;gt;info&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;), we saw a 12 week downwards/sideways movement from May to July-21. As of right now, BTC 21w EMA sits at $48k, and the current price is $42k. This points to a scenario where I think, we are about to see bearish (or sideways at best) price movements for the next 1-2 months. The recent update in human malware might also contribute to this trend. But do I think $69k was the top of this cycle? &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;NO&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. Reason being:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;If the theory of the lengthening cycle is to be believed, we still can be bullish for long, and the BTC can go much higher than $69,000.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The charts indicate that this wasn&amp;amp;#39;t a double top, as the recent local top($69,000) is a bit higher than the last one ($64,000).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All in all, I think this is merely a short term (3-4 months) downward volatility period, and it&amp;amp;#39;s a nice time to DCA down your average prices. But I would like to emphasize the fact that crypto investments are not for everyone. As seen in many of the recent posts and FUD, it&amp;amp;#39;s clear that  some people can&amp;amp;#39;t handle bearish price movements.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;If you’re gonna do dumb things because your stock goes down, you shouldn’t own a stock at all.

~ Warren Buffett
&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Similarly, if you&amp;amp;#39;re gonna sell your coins every time it goes down, you probably shouldn&amp;amp;#39;t invest in crypto at all.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While Mr Buffett might not be the most pro-crypto person, we can all agree that his views on price movements are on-point and effective. That&amp;amp;#39;s because, price movements and patterns in crypto are very similar to that in traditional stock markets, except with much higher volatility.   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In conclusion, I would say that we need to have a fair bit of persistence and faith to make it out of this tunnel. I certainly think that $69k was not the top, and we can go much higher in this cycle. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cheers!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

About 12 hours ago, they tweeted that a &amp;amp;quot;small number of users&amp;amp;quot; reported suspicious activity on their accounts and that they would disable withdrawals for a bit, just to be safe. Just ten minutes ago, they tweeted &amp;amp;quot;Update: Withdrawal services have been restored. All funds are safe.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I personally have never used crypto.com specifically and therefore have no money on there. But honestly, if this had happened to one of the exchanges I use (I won&amp;amp;#39;t say which because it&amp;amp;#39;s not about that, but I use two of the big ones and have a relevant amount of money for me on each of them) I wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t have been worried at all. Big exchanges have insurance, have most of their funds in cold wallets, and especially a very public exchange like crypto.com couldn&amp;amp;#39;t afford the PR disaster of not refunding their customers if it was even remotely their own fault.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;ve seen a few posts and many comments saying that this proves you should never trust an exchange with cour crypto. But looking at how they reacted - immediately disabling withdrawals, communicating openly etc. - and considering they &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;have&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; to react this way to avoid a PR disaster - I think if this shows anything, it&amp;amp;#39;s rather the opposite: if you have a good password and 2FA, most likely it&amp;amp;#39;s totally fine to leave your coins and tokens on one of the big, trustworthy exchanges.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m not saying you should not use your own wallet, for many people that&amp;amp;#39;s the better solution.

Also have an Icy White and a LOT of crypto staked on The Exchange, in Crypto.com Earn and (due to my CRO entry price being well under $0.10) a six-figure sum of CRO staked for the CDC Icy.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To wake up today and see Reddit plastered with info about the ‘Hack’ was concerning, but not as concerning as what might happen to the price of CRO. Then I remembered several important factors:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Security&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;100% of user cryptocurrencies are held offline in cold storage.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;‘Crypto.com has a strategic partnership with Ledger, integrating its institutional-grade custody solution, Ledger Vault. We also leverage hardware security modules (HSM) and multi-signature technologies. Crypto.com has secured a total of USD 750M in cold storage insurance against physical damage or destruction, and third-party theft.’&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Users’ fiat currencies are held in regulated custodian bank accounts.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you are a U.S. resident, your USD balances are held at Metropolitan Commercial Bank, an FDIC member and insured depository institution. Your USD balances held at Metropolitan Commercial Bank are insured up to USD $250,000. You retain ownership of those funds in Metropolitan Commercial Bank accounts, meaning your fiat funds cannot be claimed by Crypto.com or its creditors.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Crypto.com Becomes the First FinTech Company to achieve the coveted Data Protection Trust Mark (DPTM) awarded by Singapore’s Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.crypto.com/crypto-com-first-fintech-company-to-achieve-singapores-data-protection-trust-mark-dptm/&quot;&amp;gt;https://blog.crypto.com/crypto-com-first-fintech-company-to-achieve-singapores-data-protection-trust-mark-dptm/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Communication&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As soon as the hack had been confirmed, CDC did what they have always done best: swiftly recognised that there was an ongoing issue and communicated not only what had happened (2FA compromised on user accounts), but also reassured users that all withdrawals would be suspended until they rolled out an app update which would enable 2FA to be re-enabled and accounts once again secured:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;CRO and Staking&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One main reason that a lot of people prefer CDC is the high rates paid on Earn when you stake your coins for a fixed period. Staking is also available on the CDC Exchange and on the CDC DeFi Wallet. That seems to have been a HUGE positive as neither The Exchange nor the DeFi Wallet were affected and remained fully functional while the app was locked for an enforced 2FA reset for all users.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Moreover, as a large percentage of the supply of CRO is staked, a run on the price of CRO was prevented (at least so far).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The Crypto.com VISA Cards&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Wallet for the CDC VISA card has always remained entirely separate from the Fiat Wallet and the Crypto Wallet. You can only transfer -FROM- the Fiat or Crypto Wallets to your VISA Card to top up the balance. There is no option to transfer FROM your CDC VISA back to the Fiat or Crypto Wallets. I now see that as a huge positive as the CDC VISA cards were completely unaffected during the hack and continued to function as normal.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The significance of this hack to the reputation of CDC&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We’ve been before. Back in 2019 Binance was hacked when 2FA was compromised and some $40 million of crypto was stolen (&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plugandplaytechcenter.com/resources/binance-hack-three-lessons-you-can-learn-it/&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.plugandplaytechcenter.com/resources/binance-hack-three-lessons-you-can-learn-it/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;). Binance were also swift to act, admit what had happened and keep users informed of how they would address the breach – that was why trust with users was retained and Binance is today, three years on, the largest exchange in the world.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At this point, it appears a similar exploit was used by the hackers to gain access to some CDC accounts and some users have reported funds being transferred from their crypto wallets. Given that this has happened less than a month after the renaming of the Staples Center to the Crypto.com Arena – and just a month before the Crypto.com SuperBowl ad is due to air, I’d say the timing of this hack was ideal. Let me explain why …&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Conclusion&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We all know that CDC have spent an absolute fortune on two things: Regulatory Compliance and Advertising/Sponsorships. They also have official partnerships with VISA and LEDGER. Given just how large their budgets clearly are, securing customer accounts and ensuring this NEVER happens again will almost certainly be their top priority at this point.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bad as this is, CDC’s response has so far been textbook and for that they deserve credit. But what will really matter is how they keep us all updated, how they propose to tighten security and -most importantly of all – that CDC fully reimburse any customer who lost funds as a result of this attack.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fortune may Favour the Brave, but we crypto holders are unforgiving. CDC, this is your moment to retain our trust and show the sceptics that hiring Jason Bourne was FAR from your best move yet.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Gamers threatened to cancel their Discord membership, Square Enix got criticized for introducing NFTs in &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Kingdom Hearts&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, Ubisoft got panned for a similar NFT program last month...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At first, I was aghast. Why would gamers reject so violently a new technology? I am not a gamer myself, so it was troubling.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But I read about it, and I came to this conclusion : gamers are not against to NFTs, they are against microtransactions cash-grabs. And to them, non-fungible tokens are nothing more than another way for studios to make more money. But this will change.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;From what I read, the gaming industry has been plagued by microtransactions for quite some time now. You pay $60 for a game, and yet, you need to fork out more money to buy clothes, armor, weapons, etc., for your character. That pisses off players, and rightly so. So when big studios such as Square Enix or Ubisoft announced plans to offer NFTs, those same gamers are pissed off : they only see this technology as another form of microtransactions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;(There are also energy consumption concerns, but as most NFTs are build on Ethereum, those concerns will evaporate in six months when it switch to proof-of-stake.)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;That&amp;amp;#39;s why I think that, in the long-term, NFTs will find a way into the gaming industry.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; When/if big studios find ways to make it enticing for players, the revolution will begin. The tech will mature, the fears will fade away, and our ecosystem will benefit from this.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Imagine risking your 42 ETH for a newly created token that is not even known much. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A guy lost over $135k while trying to purchase a token named &amp;amp;quot;fees.Wtf&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The user accidentally swapped 42ETH for 0.00004 WTF. ,the actual value of the token was just $0.000005 &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This happened due to low liquidity in the trading pool .&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fees.WTF is a tool that allows users to track the fees they spend on ETH.It airdropped it&amp;amp;#39;s WTF tokens on Thursday. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Use cases include staking WTF or it&amp;amp;#39;s liquidity pool tokens with annualized returns of up to 7,000%&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As soon as the token got listed on ETH based exchange Uniswap,speculators hoping that an eventual price rise would net them handsome returns.In this race, the guy lost 42 ETH.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The developers seeded the initial pool on Uniswap with over 2,211 WTF and 0.000001 ETH causing a huge imbalance in the trading pool. This allowed users to sell low amounts of WTF for relatively high amounts of ETH, while buyers of WTF ended up purchasing the tokens at a much higher value&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;
