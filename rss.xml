You may have also heard that the US federal reserve Bank (FED) and probably also the European Zentral Bank (EZB) are going to raise interest rates in the coming years to put everything to normal.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is what central bankers and high ranked politicians currently want you to belief, maybe some of them believe it themselves but it doesn&amp;amp;#39;t change the fact that it is a straight lie ! We are about to witness an unprecedented inflation period affecting the entire western world.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To prevent the whole system from collapsing, these authorities are doing the only thing they can. It is necessary to stretch this period over several years keep the masses calm during the process of devaluation. This is why they assure you: it is only transitory / we are raising interest rates and this will fix it / ... and so on. Sadly this is complete BS.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here is the real situation:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The FED and especially the EZB were buying government bonds with freshly printed money for years, to allow governments to spend money they don&amp;amp;#39;t have without paying interest on it. The pandemic was only the big final topping of a long term development that started after the 2008 crash. The amount of bonds the central banks are sitting on is enormous. Since 2008, the FED three-folded the amount of Dollar in existence and the EZB even six-folded the amount of Euro in existence. This money has already been created. This is not something that could eventually happen in the future. It has already happened.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In classic economy theory, it was assumed that an increase in the amount of money will directly result into inflation. But how was it then possible that they printed and spend these gigantic amounts of fresh money without causing inflation until now ? The answer to that was given by the work of the economist John Maynard Keynes. The short version is that freshly minted money is not causing instant inflation. There has to happen some kind of trickle down effect from the freshly minted money into the system which can take years. The inflation will first appear once the new money trickled down into the circulation spheres of the average people.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But this is not a matter of if, its a matter of when. The now starting inflation is basically the beginning of this trickle down effect reaching the financial spheres of average people. But sadly it is only the first tip of a giant amount that is yet to come. No raise of interest rate will prevent this, it will only slow it down. Ultimately, the money is printed and its just a matter of time until it trickles down.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With that in mind, we can try to make a rough estimate of the overall inflation ahead of us. The FED three-folded the amount of Dollar in existence and the EZB even six-folded the amount of Euro in existence. Therefore, once everything which is already printed yet has trickled down, the Dollar value will decrease to a third and the Euro value will decrease to a sixth. Depending on the time frame they manage to stretch the process, some of the inflation will be eaten up by economic growth, if there is one. However, including housing, energy, transportation and so on and not only the basic food basket used by the government, we can probably still expect around a decade with a real average annual inflation north of 8% in the US and even more in the EU.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As already said, a raise of interest rates wont prevent this because the money is already there. It has just not trickled down yet. A raise in interest rates only slows the process down because the entities (mostly Banks) that are currently sitting on all that money are less eager to spend it when they get interest on it. But this is only stretching it. Having it stretched over a longer period of years just makes the whole thing more digestible.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There is only one way to actually prevent this whole thing from happening, but this wont or cant be done. The central banks would need to sell these giant stacks of bonds they obtained and take the money back out of circulation (burning it) before it can trickle down. The problem with this is that would crush the entire bond market. This would lead to the majority of the balance sheets of all Banks becoming worthless and countries having to pay real interest rates again when borrowing money which most of them cant afford anymore. Ultimately this would bankrupt the whole western banking industry and probably also a lot of entire countries in the western world. Whole industries, currencies and maybe even societies would collapse. Or in other words: 2008 would look like a small correction compared to this.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I don&amp;amp;#39;t think I have to further explain why this is not an option. The way this will be played is to stretch it over a long time period to distribute the impact over years and being able to keep the majority calm until it is done. You will see, after a few years it will be the new normality to have this kind of inflation and the majority plus the media wont even care anymore. The value of the giant amounts of generational debt our governments and societies have created over the last decades will melt away. It will be a consolidation but also the biggest transfer of wealth witnessed in the younger history.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With this knowledge, it is about you to position yourself correctly in the upcoming era of inflation. The majority of the bill will be paid by ordinary people having a few thousand bucks in their saving accounts and low wage earners which wont get a sufficient raise in salary to compensate. The rich and wealthy have the majority of their wealth in equity and other goods. Some even have debt in Dollar on the other side. This is how you profit the most from whats coming up. Just look at Microstrategy for example. Creating Dollar debt in exchange for a scarce asset (Bitcoin). Debt devalues and the asset increases in value.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I am not trying to advocate taking debt here but everybody should at least think about not keeping significant amounts of money in currency over the next decade. Saving accounts are completely off limits in my opinion. If you are thinking about buying a flat or a house, now is probably the perfect time. Other possibilities to position yourself to protect hard earned value of your money are Gold, Stocks or of course Crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thank you for reading this long text and I hope it was somehow interesting for you.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;TL;DR: The current Inflation is absolutely not transitory. It will last for years and probably become a new normality. You should position yourself to protect the hard earned value of your money.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That&amp;amp;#39;s fine, they both have pros and cons. But what I hate is how these are written in a &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;hostile manner&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; like &amp;amp;quot;You deserve to lose money!&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;No. nobody deserves to lose money&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, let alone being laughed at (unless you&amp;amp;#39;re a scammer, then karma is a bitch).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Remember that according to the stats, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;~75% of subscribers joined after January 2021&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. It&amp;amp;#39;s safe to assume they started their crypto journey around that time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Do you really expect newbies to be able to protect their seed phrase? Or not to mistakenly send their coin to the wrong address?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is much safer to keep them in exchange as long as it&amp;amp;#39;s the big one like Coinbase, Kraken, or Binance. Not to shady shit like Bitmart who listed every shitcoins out there. We have come a long way since Mt.Gox.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We should be glad that more and more people are investing in crypto. If someday managing own wallet is much simpler, then people will start transitioning by themselves.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And don&amp;amp;#39;t forget to &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;activate your 2FA&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, but not with phone number because that&amp;amp;#39;s easily hijacked.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

To get mass adoption to the levels we want, we need an iPhone style event into the market, by some massive and already well-established company. Sure LG and other companies made touch screen phones before Apple did, but Apple did it better and they made it much more simple to use. They&amp;amp;#39;ve dumbed down the whole thing, so even half-trained monkey could do it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is what we need in crypto. Right now all we have is a crap-ton of different chains, bridges, multiple ecosystems, multiple wallets etc. it&amp;amp;#39;s just too much for the average Joe. Heck, even for myself it was truly difficult to sell one coin the other day (not gonna shill here any names). It took me around 12 different steps, moving between bridges, converters and so on etc. before I was finally able to cash it out to FIAT without destroying myself with high fees to make it worthwhile. Sure, I could just cash out via traditional methods, but I&amp;amp;#39;d lose like 15% of my coins doing that. This stuff should be automated a long time ago.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But this will take time, a lot of time. The true adoption will start when we are allowed to just add crypto to our Google Pay or Apple Pay by scanning a quick QR code from our crypto wallet, without thinking two secs or giving a single fuck if our coins are going to disappear because we&amp;amp;#39;ve mistyped one or two letters in the wallet. Or because your wallet supports coins X, Y, Z but not coins A, B, C. Until then &amp;amp;quot;mass adoption&amp;amp;quot; is just an empty slogan that won&amp;amp;#39;t happen for another 10 years or more.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Nobody knows that is going to happen but personally I don&amp;amp;#39;t think so and in any case I am not selling at all. If anything, I am buying more as I have not invested more than I can afford to lose so I don&amp;amp;#39;t care what happens.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Of course nobody wants to lose money but you have to decide. Imagine you sell now and later this year we break 100k. I would rather lose all my money than not being invested once this happens. The risk of NOT holding is just too high in my opinion.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto is the only chance to achieve financial freedom and escape the hamster wheel we are all stuck in. I am gladly taking the risk for this possibility. If the money is gone, nothing changes anyway and we keep hamster wheeling.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto was supposed to be decentralized so it would not have a single entity controlling it. We would not be bond to the whims of a single centralized government or private entity.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And as of late i&amp;amp;#39;ve seen crypto being controlled by the fed. They say they will print more crypto pumps, they say they will print less crypto dumps. This is the same as the stock market and it&amp;amp;#39;s a shame because it defeats the sole porpuse of decentralization.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you think the fed will ever fight inflation think again&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/ypt6qrxr98b81.png?width=770&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=d53e7d664544a3fa7e501f82d9926a4902962655&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/ypt6qrxr98b81.png?width=770&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=d53e7d664544a3fa7e501f82d9926a4902962655&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;1921- &amp;amp;quot;In the 19th century, deflationary periods were the result of an increase in production, rather than a decrease in demand. During the Great Depression, deflation was the result of &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;a collapsing financial sector and bank failures&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. &amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Demand is higher and production is slower, there&amp;amp;#39;s news everywhere of cars unable to be sold because they lack chips.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This pandemic hit most supply chains everywhere, and that&amp;amp;#39;s until it&amp;amp;#39;s normalized there will be more demand for some products than actual production.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Maybe in a couple of years while normalizing the supply chain we will actually produce more than demand requires and it will be 1921 all over again....&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;1930 -  &amp;amp;quot;During the Great Depression, deflation was the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;result of a collapsing financial sector and bank failures&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. The deflation that took place at the outset of the Great Depression was the most dramatic that the U.S. has ever experienced. Prices dropped an average of ten percent every year between the years of 1930 and 1933. &amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Prices drop 10% a year is something that won&amp;amp;#39;t stimulate the economy, ask yourself why would you buy a car worth 10k when next year it will be 9k or a house. People would spend much less because saving was making them money.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is something the economy can&amp;amp;#39;t afford right now, many companies are barely surviving and the least they need is people to be willing to spend less money because they don&amp;amp;#39;t want to spend their savings which are increasing in value.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto should be an edge against inflation which is rampant and most likely never tackled with, printing is done there&amp;amp;#39;s no way they will reverse course.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;No matter what the fed says I doubt they will actually go for deflationary policy. They might print less.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Look at Obama&amp;amp;#39;s term he started with 2008 crash the housing crash!!!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;8 years of Obama&amp;amp;#39;s term with good economy and yet the fed didn&amp;amp;#39;t increase rates. Only when Trump became president did they started increasing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So if we take into account the same we still have 6 years left of Joe Biden with covid crisis, if he lives that long., with no rate hike.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Resume: Crypto will always be an edge against inflation which will never be tackled, No matter what the fed says crypto should do it&amp;amp;#39;s own thing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I fear more rampant inflation and the hit on my savings than a crypto crash, because crypto proved to me it can recover, and my savings are still worth less and less.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Following conversation on Discord:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Me: I&amp;amp;#39;ve been holding Ethereum since last January and I&amp;amp;#39;m currently up 250%, but that&amp;amp;#39;s also because I&amp;amp;#39;ve sold it and bought it again many times when it was rising strongly.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My friend: Huh? Why is that?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Me (honorary math professor): Because I get more profit.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Silence&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Me: The following: Imagine investing 100€ in Ethereum. The price goes up by 20%. Now I have 120€. If I now sell and buy again - and disregard the transaction fees - and the price rises again by 20%, I am at 144€. If I had not sold, it would have risen by 40% and I would only have 140€. Understand?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;LOUD SILENCE IN THE DISCORD CHAT&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Friend 1: Is it just me who thinks this is incredibly stupid?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Friend 2,3,4: No Nope Nah, that makes absolutely no sense &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I (slowly despairing🥲), think to myself that I could have saved the transaction fees, which are astronomical with Coinbase anyway, for one thing, and that from now on the story will be held in front of me again and again if I don&amp;amp;#39;t manage to clarify it now. So I try to explain the thing again and already during this I realize that it sounds really dumb.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The first and probably most specific to crypto is that he wasn&amp;amp;#39;t against stablecoins continuing to exist even if they began to issue a CBDC USD-meaning there&amp;amp;#39;s less of a threat that stablecoins would suddenly collapse from a ban which would be very destabilizing for the crypto ecosystem.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The second was that he (in passing) spoke of likely allowing bonds to expire off but he specified that this would probably be towards the end of the year-so this is basically quantitative tightening since they wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t be continuing to hold the same amount of bonds since they wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t be buying any more. I think there was some fear originally that they would start doing the rate hikes plus tightening all at once in March.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Of course overall he&amp;amp;#39;s still talking about planning for at least 3 hikes this year plus the tightening so it&amp;amp;#39;s not like he went all out in favor of easy money, but basically it wasn&amp;amp;#39;t the worst case scenario that was driving a lot of fear in recent days.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now I guess we wait patiently for the CPI numbers tomorrow-the two bullish scenarios for Bitcoin would be either lower than expected numbers causing the Fed to reduce the number of hikes or further delay tightening, or if the numbers are so freaking crazy that people think the Fed cannot control inflation at all. That said, I don&amp;amp;#39;t think either are particularly super likely scenarios. If it comes in about what everyone is expecting or a little bit hotter then they&amp;amp;#39;ll hike rates and tighten as planned. Whether that really is going to further impact Bitcoin is unclear-we&amp;amp;#39;re already down 40% and while we&amp;amp;#39;ve drawn down 80% in the past it&amp;amp;#39;s also a much more mature asset class now and there&amp;amp;#39;s global exposure so it&amp;amp;#39;s not solely US policy driving price.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TL;DR: Powell said stablecoins A-OK, will still hike rates soon but likely tightening not until Q3-Q4. Not worst case scenario feared.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/m5tw25x8b6b81.jpg?width=1800&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=a6d98a65a43a4646795b73789b8f0963894b0638&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/m5tw25x8b6b81.jpg?width=1800&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=a6d98a65a43a4646795b73789b8f0963894b0638&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;ve watched on-chain data for years. I&amp;amp;#39;d argue that currently, it&amp;amp;#39;s the most bullish I&amp;amp;#39;ve ever seen it, and the micro backdrop looks the same. I&amp;amp;#39;m calling for $500k in the next 12 months. Longterm holders are in a longterm uptrend, while short-term holders are in a longterm downtrend. When you consider the halving we had in 2020 (which means only 6.25 coinbase per block), the rise of commercial mining (which means huge amounts of HODL&amp;amp;#39;ed bitcoin), the parabolic growth of the LN (which means ever increasing amounts of BTC locked in nodes), the explosion of hard wallets (Trezor will give you 13% off if you wait to buy yours, and Ledger tripled its capacity), the possibility of spot ETF&amp;amp;#39;s (which means pension, IRA, and institutional exposure), that 90% of all BTC has already been mined  (the last 10% will take over 100 years to mine), etcetera, there&amp;amp;#39;s not much time left until we reach the counterpoint. That&amp;amp;#39;s where governments, financial institutions, and wealthy families late to the inevitability compete for the last large tracts of UTXO space on the blockchain, and bring the type of volatility the gold/papiermark enjoyed, before bitcoin&amp;amp;#39;s transactional (currency) epoch arrives:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/dtjkna3cb6b81.png?width=601&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=3c5a310fb1c2c31678582e086a9bd05b54236542&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/dtjkna3cb6b81.png?width=601&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=3c5a310fb1c2c31678582e086a9bd05b54236542&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On the micro side, all the publicly listed bitcoin companies (miners, FinCen etcetera), are at exhausted RSI&amp;amp;#39;s and trading at or below 52-week lows. The perp funding rates are negative. Futures ETF&amp;amp;#39;s have been in a consistent downtrend since November. The fear and greed index reached multi-year lows two days ago. Too, the massive amount of Asian selling is drying up (Huobi alone dumped 350k coins over the last quarter and several exchanges dumped all their Chinese customers). But you&amp;amp;#39;d never know any of this from the story on-chain data is trying to tell us that dumb money isn&amp;amp;#39;t heeding:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/stqgygmyb6b81.jpg?width=1800&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=78ae90722bc8c98455aef5e353d922f4e7a49591&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/stqgygmyb6b81.jpg?width=1800&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=78ae90722bc8c98455aef5e353d922f4e7a49591&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/p7bjjtv7c6b81.jpg?width=640&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=a10a5ca31e4c4e6028b53172221bd5f3649bf758&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/p7bjjtv7c6b81.jpg?width=640&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=a10a5ca31e4c4e6028b53172221bd5f3649bf758&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So for me, I&amp;amp;#39;m going to follow the subtext, and not listen to the noise. I&amp;amp;#39;m going to trust the math. I&amp;amp;#39;m going all-in with my dip money which I usually keep at 5% of my BTC holdings. I&amp;amp;#39;ll do so un-hedged, and prepare a loan on my BTC in the event one of the below FUD&amp;amp;#39;s drives us down briefly.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;FINAL FUD&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There are 3 potential FUD&amp;amp;#39;s this year, and after, there won&amp;amp;#39;t be anymore, ever.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Regulation. This will obliterate altcoins and almost all stablecoins.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Mt. Gox distribution date&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Russian invasion of Ukraine. This could spike energy prices, clobber mining&amp;amp;#39;s economy of scale, and force distribution of several miner&amp;amp;#39;s holdings to pay overhead. Kazakhstan produces energy at .04-.05 cents per kWh, which is about the cheapest in the world and has 20% of the hash power for example. Adding .01 to that is extremely severe.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitcoin will pivot off all of this quickly.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And as much as they are supporters of cryptocurrencies, 99% of people do it to have more money in fiat currencies so they can achieve their goals.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When trading with cryptocurrencies, we compare their value with the euro, dollar, pound, etc.  Currently we are comparing the value of everything to our current fiat price.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;An international financial system such as crypto takes time to adapt and I can only imagine what awaits us in the future, but I belive that even then we will still compare value with traditional currencies.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

It go the point where Nintendo became THE word for a games console for those that had only a passing knowledge of the subject.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fast forward to today and bitcoin is the new Nintendo, it has owned and still owns the lions share of the crypto market. Most people have heard of it and probably think all crypto IS just bitcoin. Now people refer to everything as a &amp;amp;#39;coin&amp;amp;#39; no matter what it actually is.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Hodling is simple, but it isn’t easy.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;When you get rich very few will be genuinely happy for you. Try to keep your success as quiet as possible.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Consistency is key.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;DCA + smash buying helps soothe emotional volatility.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Have a plan and stick to it. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The mainstream news is always hilariously wrong about bitcoin.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Shitcoins are a high risk / high reward proposition.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;DONT TRADE. But If you are going to trade you need to measure your performance in bitcoin terms. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Mining is a profession, not a hobby. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Frugality is paramount. If people aren’t laughing at your lifestyle, you probably aren’t hodling or stacking hard enough.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Bitcoin maximalist.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Dude lives in 2012 and still believes that all coins that aren’t bitcoin are scams. He can’t see value in any other project outside bitcoin and worship people like Michael Saylor. Brags about understanding Austrian school of economics but never really read Mises. Constantly makes comparisons about energy use of bitcoin vs banks and gold.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The ethereum dude.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He isn’t a maximalist and actually enjoy other projects, but thinks that ethereum is king. Consider the first mover advantage eth has over smart contracts too much to be overcome by other coins. Keep his coins at the exchange for obvious reasons.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The Cardano geek.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Usually they follow Charles Hoskinson like a cult. Live in a completely isolated world where all that exists is Cardano. They read through each whitepaper but never read about other projects outside of Cardano. They constantly brag about how Cardano is safe due to Haskell and how fast it can become with Hydra. Don’t really do anything with his Cardano, since there’s nothing to do.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The solana cheated wife.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He knows the network is centralized. He knows it keeps getting offline. He knows how bad the initial token distribution was. But since he gained some money in Solana, he is always looking for explanations about Solana problems and bragging about a zillion tps.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The obsessed trader.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He can’t hold one coin for over one month. He’s always checking his charts and always getting hyped about new coins. He says he’s into crypto for the long term but his average holding period is one week. Usually loses money.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The CRO boomer.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Uses the debit card and stake. Believes that CRO will be huge. Don’t understand much about crypto in general, but usually has lots of money and stake all his CRO to get shiny metal cards.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The moonshooter.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He’s always looking for the “next big thing” and very susceptible to YouTubers and influencers. Constantly shill his shitcoins at Reddit and social media. Usually loses money&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The FUDster.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The crash is always incoming and he’s always afraid of losing all his money. Deep down he believes that crypto is a Ponzi scheme. Usually he’s at mid-age and hide his crypto investments from his wife. Every 10% dip he thinks the world is gonna end. Constantly talks about Tether.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Buy high and sell low.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He knows the theory but can’t help to the opposite. He always FOMO at ATH and paperhand sell at lows. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The hodler.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He doesn’t really know much about tech details about the projects he invest in. He doesn’t take profits nor take losses. He doesn’t try to time the market. He just hodl. But that doesn’t stop him from getting hyped up when he has unrealized gains and extremely worried when he has unrealized losses.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Do you know anyone that are in these stereotypes ?
Do you identify in one of them ?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;*sorry for any potential grammar mistakes. I’m from Brazil and English is my second language.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I just don&amp;amp;#39;t know what all it gets used for. Also the job in tech is internal tools dev at a medium sized game publisher. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yep. I think about this constantly, I understand the use case for something like Bitcoin. Transfer money with no middle men. I get that. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What the hell are these other chains supposed to be doing? Half my damn portfolio is Ethereum and I genuinely can&amp;amp;#39;t tell you what your supposed to do with it. Why would you develop an app on a Blockchain? Let alone how. Is there some inherent benefit here? God I have no clue. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For the longest time I just thought it was like providing a decentralized version of something like AWS or Azure, like a grass roots server host. Holy shit I was wrong. There&amp;amp;#39;s all sorts of shit you can make apparently. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But yeah idk. Feels good to come clean. I got into it cause it seemed like a smart investment and so far so good. But I&amp;amp;#39;m amazed I&amp;amp;#39;ve not come across any real application of it in my day to day life so far that I&amp;amp;#39;m aware of at least. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I cannot be alone here right? Please. It&amp;amp;#39;s wild to me that I understand more about the idea behind what an NFT is (supposed to be) used for than any application of any other blockchains. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Idk if anyone else is in this camp and feels dumb you&amp;amp;#39;re not alone. I feel ya.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I am much younger than the average user of this subreddit and I know for a fact that I would never fall for such scams.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So these scams go something like this:-
It&amp;amp;#39;s usually a youtube live video of a conference where Elon Musk, Jack Dorsey or Vitalik Buterin with 12k to 20k live viewers which are bots. These conferences are so old that a simple Google image search if these conference would be enough to know for a fact that it is a scam. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Is it just that people are too greedy? I am only 16 and sometimes wonder that if adults are just money hungry dumb dumbs. Please people do not disappoint me.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
