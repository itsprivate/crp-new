&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Bitcoin Bridge&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Still planning to have the launch this month. It should be an external launch so onboarding externals for running vaults. Some minor details to take care of still, but the launch is still planned for this month.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Trustless Ethereum bridge&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Expecting a month of work, but hoping to finish everything by the end of this month.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Streaming sync and fast sync&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixing last problem before launch on Testnet. No update currently.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Cross Shard Transactions&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Needs a few more rounds of iteration and feedback on designs. A few more weeks until start of implementation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Polygon Bridge&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The team is working on this currently. More updates will come on this including date of launch in a few weeks.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Staking Derivatives&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Currently working on the consistency of the bots and this is taking longer than expected. Once this is stable, they will work on a technical plan for updates and final dates.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;!!!Smart contract staking allows metamask users to stake!!! THATS HUGE&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Cross Chain API&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is as far as it can go before the bots and bridge are out. Once these are up and running, it should be a generic solution and finished shortly after.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Cosmos Bridge&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;An external team is currently working on this. There should be a progress update sometime next week. The end goal is to launch in February.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Secure Resharding&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Working with the Research DAO. Waiting on the write up adn finalizing design.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;1 second finality&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The feature is a major change so it is still under review. Increasing the gas fees slightly will help grow the block time and help with spam attacks as well, while still keeping the fees small for users.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Decentralized RPC&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bringing in more partners to help with this. Should be done by the end of January. Currently working on new ways to continue becoming more decentralized.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Decentralized Ops&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is used for onboarding teams to help with ops. Used to introduce a new Devnet.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Ambassador DAO&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;goal for 2022 is 100 meetups per month around the world. The first meeting meeting will take place this month. Establishing a way to pay governors currently.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Apart from that, the recent crash did barely any damage to the coins price. Harmony is going strong and it is accumulating to the new ATH. When everyone is talking about ZK rollups on ETH, maybe more people should look in ONE and their immensely cheap gas fees.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I know many are really disappointed that we didn‚Äôt quite see 100K EOY as many so called ‚Äúexperts‚Äù have been predicting. And now we‚Äôre seeing a lot of red to start the new year. Which is a good reminder that stonks along with Crypto don‚Äôt always go up in a straight line. But no need to be worried if we zoom out and look at how far we have come in a 1, 2, 5 years we see a lot of reason to still be super bullish. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now is the time to start up the old fiat miner and be getting ready as much disposable cash as you can to start DCAing into the market if you haven‚Äôt already been. If this is truly a bear (which I am still not convinced) this is where fortunes are made. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So don‚Äôt lose interest like many retailer investors are doing just cause we aren‚Äôt seeing crazy gains. Remember smart money is accumulating right now. So for once let‚Äôs not be dumb money and ‚Äúbuy high sell low‚Äù but instead be smart money and ‚Äúbuy low, buy lower, buy lowest, then sell high‚Äù. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So to those still holding on and stacking sats I am proud of you and I bet your mom is too. So to all those that haven‚Äôt lost faith and still accumulating during these uncertain times let me see those beautiful hands!!!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So what? There buying crypto not every single person can throw a couple hundred dollars at every dip, some people don‚Äôt have the luxury of having expendable fiat to throw into crypto if they did they would put more in crypto &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What you need to understand is not everyone has a high paying job or the cost of living in there area is higher then some, or they have a family to support and $20/week is all they can afford to spend on crypto. so how much you throw at a dip should be irrelevant&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What does matter though is that there at least buying the crypto dip and the amount shouldn‚Äôt be criticized. Instead we should be applauding the fact there at least thinking of there future &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;$20/week times 52 weeks= $1,040 a $20 buy order does add up quickly over time &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TLDR: We shouldn‚Äôt be criticizing peoples buy order amounts we don‚Äôt know what there finances or weekly expenses are. There at least buying crypto when they can&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Its a little obscure project which might very well go to zero in about 2 weeks, but even this one&amp;amp;#39;s discord server has over 10k users in just about 3 days. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And there are hundreds if not more such NFTs projects all over cryptoverse. This is all retail for you. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now, lets not turn this into NFT hate thread, I like to gamble on NFTs, some gamble on sports, some gamble on coins..so let that be.. its not the main topic of this post. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My point is that the retail are still in crypto as a whole. Some of them surely left with the crash, but many are around. To mint these NFTs you definitely need some crypto. Activity across many networks are still growing. OpenSea still is guzzling gas and is the top most used dapp. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The retail are just not interested in BTC at all. Many users are playing play to earn games or gambling NFTs. They are just not interested in buying Bitcoin&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Key stats:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;BTC activity is still at 2018 bear market levels. It hasnt grown at all. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blockchain.com/charts/n-transactions&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.blockchain.com/charts/n-transactions&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This one is even more worrying for BTC - people have literally stopped using BTC since July: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#BTC,1y,weight&quot;&amp;gt;https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#BTC,1y,weight&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There is no network effect growth whatsoever. Without network effect, the price doesnt grow much. In the absence of clear valuation models like discounted cash flow, network growth and volume transacted has been used to arrive at valuations for networks/blockchains, and here you have BTC&amp;amp;#39;s network growth falling off a cliff. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With other networks, people are not just investing and forgetting about it, but actively doing things - whether its lending or swapping tokens or minting some dumb jpeg. This brings people to explore the network, as seen by the rise in number of participants in almost every chain that has managed to get limelight. All of these chains have growing txn/day stats. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With Bitcoin, all one can do is invest and forget. In contrast to the above networks, the txn/day is still at 2018 levels. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A BTC argument is that LN adoption is increasing, but there is no real evidence for that. You cannot know how many LN transactions happen a day, and just volume increase to a few hundred million cannot substantiate tremendous growth. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sound money, censorship resistance etc are all good narratives but if the network usage is stagnating like above, it is really a cause to worry.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Ben Cowen has estimated 70% of his viewers have already left, which is completely insane! They&amp;amp;#39;ll be back in future, and the daily thread will be full of moonbois once more, buying high and fomo&amp;amp;#39;ing into coins that you bought for 5% of the price they are buying at. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Noone can honestly say when we will recover from this downtrend, but historically speaking we always do eventually and the investors that stay around, hold good projects and accumulate during the lows are the ones that make it. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So if we keep dropping, do try and stick around, even if you have to cut some losses in the short term and switch to safer bets. If it is the bear market, then last time it took 12 whole months to reach the bottom and another 18 months for the bull to restart. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If it is just another mid-cycle low, even better, new all time highs will come this year and the people that left already will be absolutely gutted. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There will be less of us in the daily but you&amp;amp;#39;ll be surrounded by focused individuals that are prepared to grind it out and who will be handsomely rewarded next time out. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you&amp;amp;#39;re reading this, WAGMI&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I‚Äôve been a contributor on this sub and other crypto subs for the past 4+ years.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I‚Äôve made plenty of profit because of the time I‚Äôve been invested in this market but like many others, I‚Äôve made some investments at times that I shouldn‚Äôt have. I jumped in right before the tippy top of 2017. I mined a lot during the bear market. But I didn‚Äôt invest much.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now that I have some extra cash I‚Äôve decided to buy a little over the past several months. I thought to myself ‚ÄúI‚Äôll check out some of the coins/tokens that are talked about here and then make a decision for myself.‚Äù Almost every coin/token I‚Äôve bought that I read about on here has gone down. I don‚Äôt mean just a little bit. It‚Äôs gone down significantly. Like more than 50%. This place has turned into a complete pile of garbage. Maybe some of these coins will be ok in the long run but right now it‚Äôs a giant shill fest. You‚Äôre better off waiting to see what happens during the next bear market when it comes to alts. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I‚Äôm still buying for the long term but I urge you new comers to stick to the blue chips for now. 99% of the Alts will go to zero long term. Please don‚Äôt yeet into these coins. Fight the urge.  It‚Äôs not worth the risk. No one on this sub knows what they‚Äôre talking about. It‚Äôs all for moons. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I obviously see the irony in this post but this is what we used to do before moons. We actually tried to help each other. Unfortunately many who used to post here stopped a long time ago.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I noticed a high fee for the move so I had to do some research on how not to pay so much in gas.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While getting slightly frustrated at the lack of simplicity i realized that the average joe is in no way going to put up with the learning curve to do simple things like transfer money.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There‚Äôs this 45 year old man I work with that has invested in crypto and I told him he should move his crypto off the exchange and into a software wallet. He was taken aback when setting it up and understanding crypto addresses and his private key and asked me to help him through it. I did and he grasped it well enough. But it was by no means as ‚Äúsimple‚Äù as a debit card.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Without going into a million of other examples into how complicated crypto can be, to put it simply, crypto needs to adopt a more streamlined ease-of-use interface or it will never go mainstream.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I love crypto, but it is too convoluted for its own good.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yesterday, somebody in the comments of some thread asked for an ELI5 on why US bond rates matter and what their relationship is with markets and economies. What I wrote ended up being more like an ELI12, and also ended up being quite long; in any case, I have decided to modify it a bit and turn it into its own post.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;What are bonds&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;First, an introduction on what bonds actually are. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Simply put, a bond is the &amp;amp;quot;asset side&amp;amp;quot; of governmental or corporate debt. When a government or corporation borrows money, the borrower now holds a liability, and the lender holds an asset, which is expected to return them their original investment (the money they lent) plus profit (interest) at some later date. A bond is basically a token that says some government or company owes you some amount of principal by some date known as the maturity date (usually 3 months to 30 years, depending on the type of bond), plus interest. Because bonds are a tokenization of debt, they can be easily traded in a liquid, open market, just like stocks. This means that the original lender does not need to be the person who is repaid when the bond matures; the repayment and interest simply goes to whomever holds the bond at the time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There are two main types of bonds: corporate bonds, and government bonds. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Corporate bonds are the main way companies raise money, apart from selling shares. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Government bonds are how the government raises money to cover budget deficits (ie: when the government spends more than they have the tax revenue to spend, they borrow the remainder by selling bonds to whomever will buy them). If nobody is buying the government bonds, the interest will go up organically due to supply and demand until people are willing to buy them. Government bonds are often known as &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;treasuries&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, and are broken down into three categories: treasury notes (short-term maturity), treasury bills (mid-term maturity), and treasury bonds (long-term maturity).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One of the main buyers of US government bonds is the Federal Reserve, which is the name of America&amp;amp;#39;s central bank. This is the entity that is able to actually print US dollars. Everyone has heard of things like how the US government recently ran huge deficits due to &amp;amp;quot;stimulus spending&amp;amp;quot;, and that it printed the money it needed for that spending. Well, this is a slightly inaccurate picture of how it works. The government chooses fiscal policy, which means they build the budget and they set the tax rates. They are the ones who choose to overspend and run a deficit. However, they don&amp;amp;#39;t choose monetary policy: they cannot print money. This power was delegated by congress to the Federal Reserve over 100 years ago. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So, when the government runs a deficit, they sell bonds to borrow the money. If the FED chooses to, it can print a whole bunch of money and then lend that money to the government (ie: the taxpayer) by buying the government bonds with it. That is how newly printed money actually gets into the economy: the FED prints it and then lends it out to companies and to the government by buying corporate and government bonds. When the FED buys a bunch of treasuries (government bonds), it is really lending out freshly-printed cash to the American people (since the government&amp;amp;#39;s liabilities are really the taxpayers&amp;amp;#39; liabilities), and the people then owe that money, with interest, back to the FED by the time the treasury matures. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When the FED decides to buy up the government&amp;amp;#39;s bonds in order to lend to the taxpayers the money that congress is spending, they are also putting downward pressure on the bond interest rate. This is because, if the FED decided &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;not&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; to lend a bunch of money to the government to cover its deficits, the bond interest would organically rise through supply &amp;amp;amp; demand until other buyers (individuals, companies, foreign investors, whatever) are willing to buy those bonds.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So, when the FED wants to keep bond interest low, they achieve this indirectly by creating what is basically artificial demand for US bonds by buying a ton of them with money that they printed at no cost to themselves. Due to how supply &amp;amp;amp; demand works with debt, the more demand there is for bonds, the lower the interest those bonds offer.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So, the Federal Reserve executes its main task of managing the US bond rate by choosing how much government debt it buys. If they want bond rates to go up, they will print less cash and buy fewer bonds. If they want it to go down, they will print more cash and buy more bonds.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The FED is essentially a whale with the power to print money, who uses said printed money to manipulate the US bond market, ostensibly for the good of everybody.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;The risk-free rate&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The interest rate on American government bonds is considered one of the most important variables in the American (and even worldwide) economy. This is because the American gov is considered the de-facto safest borrower of all borrowers in the world. In other words, if I buy an American government bond, I am lending my money to the entity that is considered to have the smallest risk of defaulting in the world (maybe this is arguable, but regardless this is a premise that is at the core of the world economy; what&amp;amp;#39;s important is that people believe it).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There is a concept in economics called the &amp;amp;quot;risk-free rate&amp;amp;quot;. This is the interest you can get for lending your money to a 0-risk borrower, and should logically be the lowest interest rate you see anywhere in that economy. Of course, there is always technically some risk when you lend money, so the risk-free rate is technically imaginary. However, in practice, just about everybody considers the US bond rate (specifically, treasury bills, the US bond with the shortest maturity) to be the risk-free rate, as the risk is considered to be so low as to be negligible. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So, if buying American gov bonds is the safest way to lend money, it means that every single other form of loan must pay higher interest. Why? Because every other borrower is considered higher risk, and for me as a lender, I will not accept less interest for greater risk. So, if American bond interest goes up, all other loan interest (corporate bonds, bank loans, mortgages, credit cards, whatever) will organically go up, because everything must pay greater interest than American bonds to compensate for greater risk. This is simply a matter of supply &amp;amp;amp; demand mechanics.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So, American bond interest is kind of like the baseline or the &amp;amp;quot;sea level&amp;amp;quot; for all interest rates in the entire economy. This even stretches to other countries, because anyone can buy a bond from the US gov, and they are considered the safest borrower in the world, so nobody will ever lend money to anybody else unless they are compensated with greater interest than US bond interest.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;The cost of capital&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So, if US bond rates go up, and therefore all interest in the economy goes up, that means money itself has gotten more expensive. Loan interest is literally just the cost of money (known as the cost of capital). The lesser the interest, the cheaper it is for me to acquire money right now. When you realize that the entire world runs mainly on debt, it becomes clear how significant this phenomenon is.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So, when US bond rates go up, the price of capital itself goes up. That means it becomes more costly for businesses to raise money, more costly to mortgage a house, more costly to open a line of credit to buy investments, more costly to spend with credit cards, more costly to use leverage in securities markets, etc.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This means that growth goes down, spending goes down, wages go down, etc. It also means the prices of goods go down (or at least climb slower), because people aren&amp;amp;#39;t willing to pay as much, since capital itself is more expensive to acquire.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What happens when prices go down? Well, that&amp;amp;#39;s a reduction in inflation. So, when inflation is getting too high, the FED (central bank) will make bond interest go up to apply recessive forces on the economy to curb said inflation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If inflation is low, the FED might reduce bond interest in order to make the cost of capital lower to juice the economy, prop up securities markets, and incentivize growth. Too much growth though, and we end up with inflation again, meaning the FED might increase rates again. This causes a sort of wave-like dance between bond rates and the heat of the economy.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So, the FED influences bond rates ostensibly to keep the economy balanced: not too hot and inflationary (can be very bad) and not too cold and deflationary (also can be very bad).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is also worth noting that the FED wields a couple other levers it can use to increase or decrease the cost of capital (ie: the general interest rates in the economy) that are separate from bond rates. They can change the reserve requirements of banks (what percentage of total assets a bank must hold in reserve). If banks need to hold more in reserve, then they have less liquid money to lend out, so the supply of capital goes down, so market interest (cost of capital) rises. Also, the FED can change the discount rate, which is the amount of interest they charge banks for short-term loans (24 hours less) from the FED itself.  When these rates go up, banks are disincentivized from borrowing from the FED, so the bank&amp;amp;#39;s end up with less liquid capital, which means they need to be more conservative about the loans they themselves give out, which makes the supply of capital go down and thus the cost of capital go up.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;What does this mean for markets?&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now, when bond rates go up, most investment markets go down. Why? Well, the higher bond rates go, the more I can make by investing in bonds, without the risk going up. So, as bond rates go up, it becomes more and more attractive to move my wealth out of riskier markets like stocks and into what is considered the safest investment market in the world: US bonds. Since rates going up means I get greater returns on my bond investments, but the risk doesn&amp;amp;#39;t change, US gov bonds become more and more sensible to an investor as the rates increase.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Of course, bonds rates going up a smidgen doesn&amp;amp;#39;t actually suddenly make bonds a strategically more sound investment than riskier things like stocks. In fact, US bond rates have been so comically low for so long that it hasn&amp;amp;#39;t made much sense to buy bonds in years (decades, really). However, when people hear that the FED is going to increase bond rates, they think &amp;amp;quot;bond rates going up means people will sell stocks to buy bonds, so I better sell now to front-run that&amp;amp;quot;, which is the main thing that &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;actually&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; causes stocks to fall when bond rates increase.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How crypto will fare with increasing bond rates is unknown, because rates have been declining ever since BTC was born, until very recently. Personally, I imagine crypto will follow stocks down if rates go up too much, but nobody knows for sure.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Some historical context&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;US bond rates hit an ATH in 1981 around 15%. Unsurprisingly, the stock market hit a low at the same time (like I said before, you should expect an inverse relationship between bond rates and most securities markets). Think about how ridiculous 15% bond rates are. That would mean you could buy what is definitionally the safest investment available and get 15% returns each year. By contrast, the safest stock ETFs (still way riskier than US bonds) average like 7% a year.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So, in the 80s, you could double your money every 5 years while accepting what is usually considered 0 risk. Ever wonder why boomers seemed to get wealthy so easily? This is one of the reasons.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Since the ATH in 1981, the treasury note rate has fallen continuously until Covid hit, at which point it pivoted at a low of about 0.5%. Since then, it has been going back up, but is still extremely low, at around 1.5%.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Since bond rates going down means stocks go up, the stock market has been in a tremendous and arguably unnatural bull run for about 40 years, only pausing twice very briefly for &amp;amp;quot;corrections&amp;amp;quot; circa 1999 and 2008.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Since US bond rates have gotten so close to 0%, they can&amp;amp;#39;t really lower them any further without going negative (which is actually a thing, and some countries are trying negative interest now. This is related to Modern Monetary Theory, and is an extremely weird rabbit hole that nobody really knows the true consequences of yet. Imagine getting paid to borrow money. Some countries have been experimenting with this over the last 7 years). The chair of the FED (Jerome Powell) said a few months back that they have no intention of going to negative interest rates, so that means these past 40 years of propping up markets by reducing bond rates has probably come to an end. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You could think of the continuous lowering of rates for the last 40 years as the FED spending its ammunition to prop up markets and propel economic growth, but now that rates are barely above 0% and the FED isn&amp;amp;#39;t willing to go negative, they are out of ammo. Not only are they out of ammo when it comes to lowering the rates, but they are also currently incentivized to &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;increase&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; rates to combat rising inflation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is why there is fear. The FED has been sticking its hands in for 40 years to prop up markets, and now it seems they are going to stop, at least for now.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I hope this &amp;lt;del&amp;gt;ELI5&amp;lt;/del&amp;gt; &amp;lt;del&amp;gt;ELI12&amp;lt;/del&amp;gt; ELI-an-Intro-to-Econ student about why US gov bond rates are such an important concept for understanding global economics has been enlightening!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Bitcoin dipped a little, which of course isn&amp;amp;#39;t the first time in cryptocurrency history. As a crypto veteran (hodling since November 2021) I&amp;amp;#39;m still very bullish right so I figured doing some technical analysis for my fellow &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/cryptocurrency&quot;&amp;gt;r/cryptocurrency&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; members. I came up with the &amp;amp;#39;Camel Theory&amp;amp;#39;. Bear with me (no pun intended).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;The 1 day chart&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/d3yzzt5eq1a81.jpg?width=1530&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=3c2a63be9fd6bd04dec4585f00599b61cd25c54d&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/d3yzzt5eq1a81.jpg?width=1530&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=3c2a63be9fd6bd04dec4585f00599b61cd25c54d&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As you can see here, these were critical support points for the last few days.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;The 1 week chart&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/5uld34moq1a81.jpg?width=1528&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=4269814696faac50152ca408b3191fd04d18ec15&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/5uld34moq1a81.jpg?width=1528&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=4269814696faac50152ca408b3191fd04d18ec15&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At this point you can&amp;amp;#39;t really tell what a resistance or support zone is anymore. I drew some lines to pretend to know what I&amp;amp;#39;m doing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;The 1 month chart&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/3bxl7e95r1a81.jpg?width=1522&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=3f3191010ae205a92e98adff7ba72652784eeedb&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/3bxl7e95r1a81.jpg?width=1522&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=3f3191010ae205a92e98adff7ba72652784eeedb&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;OK so these two horizontal lines clearly are resistance points. Cool huh. Bitcoin seems to go up and down.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;The 1 year chart&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/ttrxfv0fr1a81.jpg?width=1526&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=b65f0dd44aa9806140e68e94203bec69c8ee7ea8&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/ttrxfv0fr1a81.jpg?width=1526&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=b65f0dd44aa9806140e68e94203bec69c8ee7ea8&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So this is the Camel Theory I was talking about. Please note: this is still just a theory I am working on. I am not sure if it will work out. But according to this theory, Bitcoin will go up again anytime this year. The 1 year chart has two peaks. The two humps on the camel&amp;amp;#39;s back resembles these two peaks. It&amp;amp;#39;s not rocket science.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Feel free to ask me any questions about this theory and I&amp;amp;#39;ll do my best to answer them. Bottomline is that this isn&amp;amp;#39;t the first time Bitcoin is dipping and we shouldn&amp;amp;#39;t panic. Some of you asked for a dip... well... here it is. And if people are in for the long haul... this dip shouldn&amp;amp;#39;t worry you at all.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The game has its own token on the Binance Smart Chain.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;The post was swiftfully and rightfully deleted by the mods before it could do much damage, but not before it got to the frontpage of this sub.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In fact, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/fEuukUf.png&quot;&amp;gt;the post made it to the top&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Right off the bat, this was extremely suspicious because:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Upvotes are still hidden which means it‚Äôs a very new post&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;It got to the top 8 posts of the sub when it was half an hour old then quickly kept going up from there&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;It only had a few comments and more than ‚Öì  of them were from the OP&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Normally when a very young post makes it to the top of the frontpage, it has an insane level of engagement and high variety comments from other users gained in a super short time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But this was not the case here.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;I come from a marketing background and know firsthand how easy it is to ‚Äúhack‚Äù social media platforms like reddit to make something go viral artificially.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Coincidentally a few months ago, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pqnd3s/i_did_a_little_digging_on_the_latest_shitcoin/&quot;&amp;gt;I also found a network of paid accounts&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and bot accounts on reddit that crypto scammers use to boost their rugpull posts of new coins (you know the ones with titles like üöÄüöÄ Anal Inu Coin üöÄüöÄüåï üåï).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So just from the points above, I was 95% sure it was just a lost rugpuller who probably meant to post it on the other less-moderated crypto subreddits.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But no.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This rugpuller had the audacity to pretend to be a new investor who had just ‚Äúdiscovered‚Äù an amazing gem, so I wanted to dig a little more.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Checking the user behind the post sealed the deal as a bought-for shiller&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here‚Äôs a screenshot of their &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/SkkTfjr&quot;&amp;gt;post history&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/cblIPdB&quot;&amp;gt;comment history&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;More suspicious things pop up here that says: this is 100% not a genuine person and this was not a genuine post:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Account had 0 post activity in 3 years&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Also 0 comment activity in 1 year&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Absolutely no crypto-related content in any comments of posts in the history of the account&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Despite all that, the account comes out of the shadows and suddenly starts making posts about a new crypto game in multiple places.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Let&amp;amp;#39;s look at their post and how they masqueraded as an innocent user who just wanted to share their discovery&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here are &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/TfhgkgH.png&quot;&amp;gt;direct quotes from the post&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; before it was deleted:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;‚ÄúHey guys, just wanted to let you all know about this new Crypto Game called &amp;amp;quot;Moonscape&amp;amp;quot;.‚Äù&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This first sentence of the post is not the language of someone who just discovered a game. This is the script of someone making a promotional video.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;‚ÄúIt is the first game launched on the Seascape Lighthouse IDO project, but made by a very successful team. Definitely worth checking out and for sure can 100X very quickly.‚Äù&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I‚Äôve read a lot of DDs and research pieces on this sub, and the only posts that compliment the devs but don‚Äôt give names or examples of what the devs actually accomplished are scam posts.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you look at how genuine newbies post and talk here, they all ask if a project is legit. They don‚Äôt confidently guarantee lambos.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;‚ÄúMoonscape is a resource strategy management #DeFi NFT Game that takes place on a futuristic moon. Players scramble for limited resources to develop their burgeoning cities.‚Äù&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The only people who use hashtags in new coin posts are the rugpullers behind the new coin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;*‚ÄúThe game will be brower based, with phone apps coming later in the year. Direct payment to moonscape token will also be availble in the game at a later date the devs have stated. Please keep an eye out for this one, its going to be masive.‚Äù
*
More marketing-derived language.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Besides, if the game hasn‚Äôt launched yet how did the user discover it? Lmao&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;‚ÄúMSCP Token is a BSC token and availble on Pancake swap, but i think the native token is on the Moonriver network. You can use the meter.passport to swap fro m BSC to moonriver which will enable you to stake the coins. I believe staking is around 70% at the moment, and you can take your coins out whenever you want without penalty. Moonriver is part of the Moonbeam network on Kusama I belive.‚Äù&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;More language that looks lifted from a brochure.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This time they added ‚ÄúI think‚Äù and ‚ÄúI believe‚Äù because they‚Äôre a third party and totally not affiliated with it. They‚Äôre 100% impartial and are just guessing things. Sure.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;‚ÄúId be happy to answer any questions if you have any as well :)‚Äù*&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They got their message mixed up here in the end.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What kind of new investor who just discovered a ‚Äúmassive‚Äù project is confident enough to take questions? If they know so much, why did they talk about the specifics in the previous section with such uncertainty?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;They also kept up the charade in the comments and had lots of replies to innocent users&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Do these sound like they came from someone who‚Äôs impartial to the completely new not launched yet project they just discovered?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/9qblSaW.png&quot;&amp;gt;OP sure knows a lot about this game&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; that hasn‚Äôt launched yet for someone who‚Äôs not involved in it&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Telling people to &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/5k07B43.png&quot;&amp;gt;send you PMs&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; is always a sure fire way to convince them you‚Äôre not a scammer yes&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Apparently &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/gCtmbMc.png&quot;&amp;gt;100x returns is realistic and genuine&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It‚Äôs honestly hilarious.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It‚Äôs like they started with a genius idea to pretend to be a normal person, but abandoned it halfway through their post then went all in on shilling in the comments.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;TLDR&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Scammers, shillers, rugpullers have a network of accounts to boost their posts to the top of subreddits, including here on /cryptocurrency.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Be mindful of the language in the post and look into the user before you believe anything.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Do you feel the fear of missing out a good buying opportunity? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yeah, then you should control yourselves. People will tell you to buy the dip and they may be right BUT your investments shouldn&amp;amp;#39;t be driven by FOMO. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you have a plan, stick to your plan. If you have money to invest in red times, spread the sell orders and don&amp;amp;#39;t throw too much at the market. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Don&amp;amp;#39;t invest more than you can afford to lose. This is even more true during red days. The opportunity seems very good but you never know the bottom of the dip. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Please act rationally and not with your emotions. DCAing doesn&amp;amp;#39;t mean throwing money at dips in hope that the market goes back up. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You don&amp;amp;#39;t need to buy every dip, in the end consistency is more rewarded. Good luck out there!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

One thing I always found fascinating is the way the markets move together, most common example, one going up while another goes down and the third not doing anything noteworthy.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Since this whole GME thing last year, I‚Äôve watch the crypto and stock markets move almost in tandem with each other, but metals markets still did their independent thing‚Ä¶until lately. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All three markets are down and look like they are starting to Synchronize and start moving in tandem. And I will tell you I don‚Äôt know what it means but it scares the hell out of me.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

As I type this, the current price is $42,948.  But this post isn&amp;amp;#39;t about the price.  It&amp;amp;#39;s about where we are and where we&amp;amp;#39;re headed, in terms of the 4 year halving-to-halving cycle.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;We&amp;amp;#39;re almost halfway to the next Halving.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You probably know what the halving is.  Let&amp;amp;#39;s talk about the effect the halving has.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Every ten minutes, a miner wins a block reward, and that&amp;amp;#39;s a big deal because block rewards are the only way new Bitcoin is created.  Right now, the block reward is 6.25 BTC.  Thus, every ten minutes, 6.25 BTC is created and awarded to a miner.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In May 2024, the block reward will be cut in half, to 3.125 BTC.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That doesn&amp;amp;#39;t sound like a big change unless you&amp;amp;#39;re a miner, but add up the block rewards over time and you&amp;amp;#39;ll see how much of a difference the halving makes on the supply of newly mined coins hitting the market:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;6.25 BTC are mined every ten minutes (roughly).  This is the current block reward.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;6.25 X 6 = 37.5 BTC are mined every hour.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;37.5 X 24 = 900 BTC are mined every day.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;900 X 30 = 27,000 BTC are mined every month.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;27,000 X 4 = 108,000 BTC are mined every four months.  I use four months as a reference point here because it takes around four months for the halving to cause an imbalance of supply and demand, better known as a supply shock.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The Supply Shock Of 2024:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In May 2024, the halving will cut the block reward in half, from 6.25 BTC down to 3.125 BTC.  Price is where supply meets demand, and the halving cuts the supply of new coins in half.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;By the beginning of fall, 2024, instead of having 108,000 BTC added to the supply since May, only 54,000 will have been added (because The Halving cut the block reward in half).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That decrease is what causes a supply shock.  The supply drops, which means there won&amp;amp;#39;t be enough supply to meet the demand, which means the price will keep rising until demand drops enough to put supply and demand in balance again.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here&amp;amp;#39;s an easy way to understand a supply shock:  Imagine that you have to attend a huge meeting every morning for a week.  Luckily, they provide enough coffee for everybody.  But one day, there&amp;amp;#39;s only half as much coffee.  The supply of coffee was cut in half but the demand is still the same, so there&amp;amp;#39;s not enough.  People are getting pissed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the marketplace, price is set by demand.  When the supply of BTC being sold goes down, the price keeps going up until there isn&amp;amp;#39;t enough demand to buy it at a higher price.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Price is where supply meets demand:  how much is being sold and how much are buyers willing to pay.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But we all know it isn&amp;amp;#39;t that simple in reality.  In 2024, miners will start hoarding coins instead of selling them, because they anticipate higher prices.  This will make the supply shock worse because it will drop the supply of coins being sold even lower.  And rising prices causes hype, which will drive demand even higher, which will push prices even higher.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;But It Ain&amp;amp;#39;t 2024 Yet!&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A typical halving-to-halving four year cycle looks like this:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Halving, followed by around 4 months of hoarding, where people hold on to their coins rather than sell them, anticipating higher prices.  This is followed by a bull run of around a year and a crash that goes on for a few months, which is followed by a roughly 2 year period of readjustment that lasts until the next halving.  I think we&amp;amp;#39;re somewhere between the crash and readjustment phase now.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Maybe we&amp;amp;#39;ll see a crash, maybe we won&amp;amp;#39;t.  Institutional money may have disrupted the usual post-bull-run crash, or at least lessened it.  Or not.  Only time will tell.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s easy to feel despair as the price of Bitcoin drops, but I view this as an opportunity.  I think you should too.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Just as the last 4 year cycle was the last chance to buy at 4 digit prices, this 4 year cycle may be the last chance to buy at 5 digit prices.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is the time to accumulate.  Buy while you can and hold, because 2024 will be here before you know it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Secure your coins, preferably in a hardware wallet.  Make sure your seed phrase is secured for the long haul.  Have a plan in place for passing on your coins if you die...  just in case.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;P.S.:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If declining prices are causing you anguish, walk away for a while.  Don&amp;amp;#39;t sell, but DO stop checking the price and reading forums and the news if doing so causes you more pain than pleasure.  Take care of your mental health.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;KEEP CALM&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
AND&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
HODL ON&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;(Sorry for the edit.  I wrote this rather quickly &amp;amp;amp; I found a typo)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

He said yes, that he sold some Eth and made a few hundred. I told him no sell only hold. He said he was &amp;amp;#39;opportunistic&amp;amp;#39; and &amp;amp;#39;didn&amp;amp;#39;t have diamond hands&amp;amp;#39;.  - Just last week we were driving in the car together and he said &amp;amp;#39;All my crypto now are ten year holds&amp;amp;#39; and I could have cried out of happiness.       &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Volatility scares people, and we all have to respect that. It will take time for people to come around and &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/b/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-import-big-data-animation-abstract-rainbow-spot-light-background-223802827.jpg&quot;&amp;gt;see this space for all that it holds&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;; from opportunistic cash grabs to apex dollar hedges, from over leveraged scams to the true start of DAOs that one-day might replace Apple.        &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Nuance is key! Consistency requires you to be as ignorant today as you were a year ago (historian Bernard Berenson said that). Are you still the same hodler you were a year ago?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Every single time there there is a small correction this sub gets bombarded with &amp;amp;quot;Did you buy the dip? Oh man you better buy the dip!&amp;amp;quot;, &amp;amp;quot;What coins are you guys buying this dip?&amp;amp;quot;, &amp;amp;quot;Yo, bro I wish the dip was 50% so I could buy more&amp;amp;quot;.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If people in this sub bought the dip as much as they claim to in their posts I am pretty positive we would have ran out of some coins in the market. To me these posts are no different than someone commenting &amp;amp;quot;To the moon&amp;amp;quot;,&amp;amp;quot;When Lambo?&amp;amp;quot; or &amp;amp;quot;Nobody knows shit about fuck&amp;amp;quot;. Low effort bullshit that gets spammed over and over again.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Just buy whatever the fuck you want, at whatever price you want.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Last week were in &amp;amp;#39;extreme fear&amp;amp;#39; at 48k. 
Today, if we reach the same price point, we all will be bullish.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In my honest opinion,
I know this is quite a rough start to the year, but 42,500 price point might be our bottom. 
For long term, its always going to go up. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This recent acceleration in sell-side momentum is getting BTC closer to a bullish trend reversal.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On days like this one,
When you cant buy a dip, 
Just keep your phone away from you, eyes off your red candle screens, and do something else today.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Come a back after a day or two. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Have a good day everyone!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Making sure everything I did was safe and calculated and non stressful. Just meander through and die. Such is life and what can you do about it. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then enter crypto. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I‚Äôm 29 and have been semi successful. I‚Äôve always been happy with where I was and never super stressed out about anything. Get the 8-5 M-F job. Log off at 5 every day. Go to the gym. Play some videogames. Got married. Was happy. Figured everything would work out as long as I played by the system. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But man has crypto lit a fire under my ass. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I‚Äôve never been super on top of money. Spent it wisely, got a house early. Been ok with it. But after crypto I researched everything constantly. I consolidated old 401ks. Opened an IRA, maxed out my current 401k match. Sold my house because I had a place to be rent free for as long as I needed for a new house and it wasn‚Äôt the best neighborhood to be in. Made a nice return on proceeds. Was able to have a dream wedding from it. Invested a good amount of safe money into crypto. Got a crypto.com card for rewards. Got another simple credit card. Boosted my credit from 680 to 720. Did much better at work since I had new motivation and got raises and promotions from. Love working OT because thats more money to have and invest. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Is my portfolio in the red? Again, yes lol. But I don‚Äôt care. Playing the long game and getting all my other finances in order has been part of the journey. Couldn‚Äôt be happier with where I am at in life now.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

But it got me thinking: if you &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;could&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; never sell your crypto for fiat, would people still buy it?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;This is a thought experiment.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; In this scenario, you couldn&amp;amp;#39;t exchange crypto for fiat, ever - but it&amp;amp;#39;s not just that exchanges wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t offer it, there would be no loophole (&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;edit: so also no crypto credit/debit cards&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;) for it. You, for some reason, could not find someone to privately sell your coin to for fiat. In this hypothetical world, everything would be the same as now - you could buy crypto with fiat, you could use crypto for their use cases, and you could even use crypto to buy stuff in the few places that enable it - but you could not get fiat for it. This means, you would either have to have a use case for crypto that isn&amp;amp;#39;t &amp;amp;quot;getting more money&amp;amp;quot;, or you would have to speculate on more adoption and more merchants accepting crypto in the future.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Would you still invest in crypto? I&amp;amp;#39;ll be honest: I&amp;amp;#39;m in this to make more fiat, if I couldn&amp;amp;#39;t exhange crypto for fiat I would not invest. What about you?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
