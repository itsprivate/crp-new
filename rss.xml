&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On most staking networks, you have a long unlock period. Its 14 days or something for Luna, 21 days on other chains.. and this period is enough for your coin to lose 99% of its value when an onchain event plays out. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To prevent staking unlock period risk, you can go for liquid staking but that has its own risks like smart contract risks and trust in a third party app and code. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the present scenario, if you had bought Luna at a higher level and staked it, you are shit out of luck. If you had not staked it, you could have exited at a much higher level. Stakers are most likely going to lose all the value.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Truthfully, I’m not looking for safety. I’ll go to the stock market for that. I’m also not looking for low caps either. What alts in the top 100 do you see surviving the bear market? Alts are where the true money will be made going forward. Do I think you can make good money in BTC and ETH still? Absolutely, but unless you have a ton invested your returns might not be life changing. I suppose it really depends on your goals. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I think more projects will survive than people think, especially projects with mid sized market caps, good teams, strong fundamentals, solid tech and real world utility.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Surely not shill another algorithmic stablecoin that almost uses the same design as the one imploding...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thats what Poloniex is doing. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/1evrx53tawy81.jpg?width=1096&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=8cdfadf4cde11232ddaae06ac9e0a276956b0adc&quot;&amp;gt;USDD = trustable, according to Poloniex. And apparently better than the one imploding :/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;USDD has already lost its peg for a while, it was down to 0.99 instead of $1.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Poloniex is ofcourse owned by Tron/Justin Sun, who are now using it to push their own instable &amp;amp;quot;stablecoin&amp;amp;quot; at a time when the paint of a stablecoin collapsing is not even dry. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I really dont want regulators to get involved in this space and put an end to everything, but it seems the large actors in this space are inviting the regulators with a red carpet...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Hysteria in &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/Coinbase&quot;&amp;gt;r/Coinbase&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, you&amp;amp;#39;d think there&amp;amp;#39;s blood running in the streets.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As I myself can attest, many people are unable to get their USD or coins out of Coinbase. Mysterious error messages happen if you try. (I can put money in and buy though.)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Why? This is speculation but you know it&amp;amp;#39;s true: a classic bank run. All the hysteria and FUD on Reddit is contributing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It happens every crash like clockwork.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Coinbase simply doesn&amp;amp;#39;t have the cash to cover the run. Like all CEXes including Kraken and Binance, they&amp;amp;#39;re fractionally reserved. The balances shown are not actually on any blockchain or cash vault - until you withdraw or transfer. (In fact it&amp;amp;#39;s very possible that once the last BTC is mined or close to it, that someday CEXes will sell more BTC combined than actually exists.)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There&amp;amp;#39;s nothing inherently &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;wrong&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; with that. Nowadays banks can get away without &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;any&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; reserves. But the FUD on Reddit is not helping, so blame your fellow Redditors. I&amp;amp;#39;m not saying I like it, but it is the way the world works for now. And in a world economic system that falls apart if constant exponential growth is not maintained, what else do you expect? Don&amp;amp;#39;t like it? Vote for people who promise to change that fundamentally flawed system.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Either way, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Coinbase is not going bankrupt anytime soon, certainly not this crash&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. Relax. They&amp;amp;#39;ll be back online. I&amp;amp;#39;m not happy about it either, but take a frickin chill pill already.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Each time this happens, it seems they get better at covering runs. Maybe they increase their reserve policies each time, who knows. Either way, you&amp;amp;#39;ll get your coins. Sucks now, no doubt, but you aren&amp;amp;#39;t going to lose your money. Not this time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The memes, the fear, the panic, and the echo chamber quality of it all.  But above all, I stay for the quality memes.  Here are some of my musings.  Hopefully it can offer some comfort for those of you who bought at ATH.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;1) Don&amp;amp;#39;t mention explicitly the total amount that you have.  I made this mistake early on and the amount of &amp;amp;quot;advice&amp;amp;quot; I got to sell from the original run from 1000 to 3000 was incredibly irritating.  You cannot imagine how much louder it got from the 17k or 18k peak when it went all the way back down to 4k or 5k.  The panic was everywhere.  Do not be surprised if the same happens again on this downturn. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;2) Stick to the fundamentals.  Price discovery does not necessarily reflect the underlying value of bitcoin.  Are blocks being mined? Are transactions being processed? If yes, just keep your head down and continue holding.  I anticipate, even expect, that bitcoin will keep getting attacked; bad actors will keep coming and going (Jihan, your tweet will forever be hilarious).  If you want to do your part (and can afford to), run a node.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;3) Please do not trade (including leveraged trades).  I started off as a &amp;amp;quot;trader&amp;amp;quot;.  I started with 100 and tried to do the compound math game of closing the day with 5% gains.  Being able to pull it off for a few days in a row (in a bull market), I thought I was a genius then all those years ago.  After a month, however, I ended up with slightly less than 100.  Then, by a sheer stroke of luck, it clicked for me that trading was a fool&amp;amp;#39;s game.  Most traders lose.  I did not think I was the exception to the rule.  It was after this moment I started to just quickly buy and hold.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;4) For whatever reason, being in bitcoin has somehow changed my spending habits and how I view material things.  I try to live on less and I try to unsubscribe from the endless consumerism that is everywhere.  It almost feels as if unchecked consumerism, inflation, and capitalism are all somehow interconnected for me.  Someone else can probably word it more eloquently.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;5) I have found it helpful to view bitcoin as a savings vehicle.  I continue to buy today, even when it was above 55000, 40000, etc.  It does not matter.  I just want to protect what &amp;amp;quot;value&amp;amp;quot; I have in FIAT from getting eroded by monetary policies that do not quite seem to benefit the small fish.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;6) I have not found it helpful to talk about it with friends and family.  So I mostly stay quiet now, even going so far as to feign ignorance on the topic if needed.  I think I am terrible at explaining it (might be why).  The reactions I have seen over the years are is that it is fake, can be manipulated, what if it goes to 0, what if I am wrong, and when will I sell?  I rarely try to correct their thinking.  I do subscribe to the quote that people will buy into it at the price they deserve.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;del&amp;gt;7) I must confess, I have not read the whitepaper.  I have copies of it, but I have never read it.  Yes, this is heresy.&amp;lt;/del&amp;gt;  At the encouragement of some, I mustered up the courage to read the whitepaper.  It was not as scary as I thought!  Thanks!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;8) I do not own anything else.  I just do not understand it.  There are so many technical terms now that are thrown around.  It is intimidating.  I remember receiving messages back in the day when a certain coin, starting with E, was priced at $3.  Maybe some of you can too.  What I have seen, however, is that a lot of these other things come and go, like the seasons.  I wonder why that is. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;9) Stay for the memes! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I cannot and do not say these things in real life anymore.  May this help some of you new bitizens in this space.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;PS. Hopefully, I did not make any typing errors.  English is not my main language!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: Thanks for the gold and love awards random bitizens! Never gotten these before =)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Other stablecoins are suffering the pressure as well as people try to cash out. This may be nothing really, and I hope it&amp;amp;#39;s nothing. USDT has hold for so many years. But we better be safe than sorry. This is just a warning for people here and I hope everything goes smoothly for USDT and other stablecoins during the next few days where the pressure for cashing out will be kinda high. I&amp;amp;#39;m sorry for everyone that lost on the Terra / Luna disaster, remember money is not everything and you learned an important lesson. Also, people with money on Celsius and other high APY &amp;amp;quot;projects&amp;amp;quot;, please think twice before going for a promise of double digits APY.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Every single post 9 times out of 10 was pure hopium and anyone with a different view was downvoted into oblivion. Majority of the posts here reminded me of the whole DOGE to the moon phase.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I don&amp;amp;#39;t learn anything new in here and have to resort to other subs to keep myself up to date with tech.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And the people I see claiming to be in crypto for 10 years and just HODL are so full of shit by just doing a simple search through their post history.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;People were telling you at $50k &amp;amp;quot;invest all your bags!&amp;amp;quot; and &amp;amp;quot;BTC is on sale it will never be this low again&amp;amp;quot;. Those same people claimed we were in a &amp;amp;quot;bear market&amp;amp;quot; I honestly heard that term thrown out so much that I even question if I know what it means anymore.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Welcome to an actual bear market. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You have the idea to HODL but many of you are completely over leveraged. You over invested what you could afford to lose and have the mindset that you&amp;amp;#39;re still going to HODL. That&amp;amp;#39;s ok.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Heres what&amp;amp;#39;s going to happen over the course of the next year or so.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto market could get worse and stay like this for a couple years. Most of you will lose hope and something will come up in life (bills, trips, etc). You will take a little bit out promising you will put more back in eventually. Slowly depleting your portfolio. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Years will go by and the next run will come and then you will reinvest again but this time will be different.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Your lessons will be your own. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We&amp;amp;#39;re all full of shit on here no one knows shit. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Start learning about the technology behind everything and the backend stuff in order to fully believe in crypto. Hopium posts on Reddit, MSNBC, tech crunch articles are not going to keep your hopes up.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit 1: There’s other subs on here that will be helpful. Discord groups, reading white papers, even Twitter has gold.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

You will be rich they said. Just hodl. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But few really knew how hard can it be to hodl through a market crash.
Fewer even knew the toll it will take on your mental health.
And they were mostly 2018 market crash survivors.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Most of us who bought at 2021 bull run are suffering heavy losses. If we sell of course.
It is really hard not to panic. And even harder to see your 10k worth 2k.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I wish we all have strength to hold and wisdom to buy instead of panic selling because this is the correct time to buy and not at peak hype of 2021.
And those of us who hold through this will get rewarded. And if you came out of this mess with a nice profit, when someone talks about how lucky you were, you owe it to yourself to tell them to go F themselves.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I just want to share it with someone and sadly I don&amp;amp;#39;t know anyone involved in crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When CRO sunk, I sold my $ 10k worth of CRO and bought LUNA. I was already at loss but somehow I saved 10k. Before they were 20k. CRO was 50% of my whole portfolio. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yesterday my 10k became 2500$. I was shocked that 20k became 2.5k just because someone decided to make a mess. I have no problem with normal fluctuations, I invest in crypto since 2 years and I don&amp;amp;#39;t panic when the market is not bullish. But man, cro and Luna did a mess because of their owners! It&amp;amp;#39;s different! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I never did margin trading. I always just bought and hold relevant projects. My initial and only investment was 400$ 2 years ago, I&amp;amp;#39;m not rich and all my portfolio was built by holding. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I decided to take 1250$ and use it to short Luna. It was worth 25$. I went to sleep and this morning it was worth 15$. I was so happy for few seconds, then I realized that I got liquidated during the night so I actually lost all.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I ended up with my last 1250$.
Luna was still falling. I decided to put everything and short it again. 
It went down to 9$, I took profit and short it again by reinvesting everything (previous profit included). &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It went down to 6$, I took profit and short it again everything I had. Now my liquidation price was 6.1$&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It went down to 4$. If I sold, I would take back almost everything I lost. I decided to wait, I suffered to much because of this mess and I deserved to get a full refund.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It went up to 5.5$. I started to panic. Just few cents and I would get liquidated. You&amp;amp;#39;ll never believe me, but for few seconds it went up to 6.15$, I throw away my phone thinking I got liquidated, but for some mysterious reason it didn&amp;amp;#39;t happen.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I checked back my phone after 1 hour. LUNA was now worth 2.90$ and I realized I didn&amp;amp;#39;t get liquidated! I closed my position and thanked the Gods of crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;ll never margin trade again, I&amp;amp;#39;ll never invest in shady projects, I&amp;amp;#39;ll keep investing in btc, ETH and few others like I always did before.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Especially new people always get pulled in to these things and they believe all the smart words they get thrown at them. They get offered &amp;amp;#39;amazing&amp;amp;#39; oppurtunities and fall for it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Most will likely chalk this up to a conspiracy theory but after having seen the manipulation Citadel is capable of from a certain stonk over the last year and a half I honestly personally 100% believe the theory. In the last couple months Ken Griffin was already in the news talking about essentially becoming a market maker for the crypto markets. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They are already experts at profiting off of destroying companies on the US market through criminal means even in a regulated market so if you don&amp;amp;#39;t think they could do so in an unregulated crypto market you are naive. Heed my words, they are looking to be top dogs in the crypto markets to make manipulation even easier for them, this is just the beginning. If they become &amp;amp;quot;market makers&amp;amp;quot; in the crypto markets then anyone who&amp;amp;#39;s long on their coins should be worried. If you personally don&amp;amp;#39;t believe the theory that&amp;amp;#39;s fine but you can&amp;amp;#39;t argue that&amp;amp;#39;s it&amp;amp;#39;s not certainly plausible if you&amp;amp;#39;ve done any DD on Citadel.   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For those who are not familiar with the theory yet here&amp;amp;#39;s a quick ELI5&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Citadel borrows 100k BTC&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Trades 25k BTC for UST&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Opens a short&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Starts dumping 75k BTC aggressively&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Once BTC reached 30k they started dumping UST to make it lose its peg&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Now Kwon is forced to sell 25k BTC at a major loss to recover the peg, further dumping the price of BTC&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Meanwhile Citadel is shorting all the way&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

Doing your own research is more important than ever&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Doing your own research wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t do much in this environment - markets are in a tricky situation, globally, a very bad one.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Many projects will see MASSIVE corrections and many would not survive so be even more careful.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So, with that aside, let&amp;amp;#39;s dive in a bit more.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A significant downside risk still persists in the market and if (god forbid) another 1-2 bad news hit the market, we may end up seeing that downside - it may mean a &amp;amp;lt;$10K BTC and &amp;amp;lt;$1K ETH. Terra is already down 90% with its own bad news and market will not be nice to any assets if bad news keep hitting. Right now, likelihood of bad news is more than the good news. Russia-Ukraine situation can escalate beyond the two countries, China real estate is a ticking bomb, China lockdown may extend further, another major covid variant can set things really back etc.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The V-shape recovery from this crash is highly unlikely, no major stimulus plan is waiting this market crash at the end of the tunnel, this market crash is good for the government because it will tame down the inflation. So don&amp;amp;#39;t try to outsmart the market with short term trades.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All in all, don&amp;amp;#39;t fall for shitty and shady YouTubers and Crypto influencers on Twitter - nobody understands the market and macro signals are more geared towards downside risk than upside optimism.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;BE EXTREMELY CAUTIOUS IN EXECUTING ANY TRADE!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Good news - this shall pass too and we will emerge stronger with a bigger crypto market (shooting to $5-10T) but have patience and wait and watch.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;God bless us all!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

And I think this approach will be proved superior in time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Right now, I&amp;amp;#39;m looking forward to seeing how crowdloan works.

Polkadot continues to roll out of the parachains, giving people the opportunity to earn a ton of free tokens. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;XCM will soon rollout allowing parachains to communicate with one another and secure token transfers between chains, among other things. On the existing parachains that have won a slot, projects are presently being built and launched.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These are just some random thoughts and I believe there is much more to come.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The stock-to-flow model suggests that should be roaming in the region of USD 100k during this period, but we have not even seen it going passed USD 70k yet.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/wny63lj62ry81.png?width=1789&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e8222f0ca93d62aa793f7d5a2164437c0e2ff619&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/wny63lj62ry81.png?width=1789&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e8222f0ca93d62aa793f7d5a2164437c0e2ff619&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That being said, there is a glaring change of pattern between the previous bear market, against the current bear market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;table&amp;gt;&amp;lt;thead&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;th align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;Year&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;th align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;2013 - 2015&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;th align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;2018-2020&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;th align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;2022-2024 (?)&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/thead&amp;gt;&amp;lt;tbody&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;Peak Price&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;USD 1,149.14&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;USD 19,970&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;USD 69,050&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;Bear Market Low&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;USD 197.24&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;USD 3,109&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;USD 28,000-29,000 (?)&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;Drawdown&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;-83%&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;-84%&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;-58% (For now)&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/tbody&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/table&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Realistically, BTC does not go lower than its previous ATH, according to previous patterns. So, we probably won&amp;amp;#39;t see BTC going down below USD 19,970. This is why this current bear market is interesting. We are seeing possibly a &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;lowering in the drawdown&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The bear market is getting more and more bearable. Pun intended.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That being said, if you had entered into crypto this year, then the next point of exit should be by the next halving in 2024/2025. Although the current halving hasn&amp;amp;#39;t met the expectations yet, the previous halving would suggest that the metrics is rather promising. If you&amp;amp;#39;re concerned about the stock-to-flow model not meeting the prediction this time, consider that BTC had exceeded the stock-to-flow prices previously as well. It will eventually balances out.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However, you do need to pay additional considerations if you&amp;amp;#39;re jumping into alts.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yet you see all these articles about how crypto is dying and BTC  has crashed, dont fall for that crap. There are coins and projects that have and will fail, that is no doubt, some are just stupid. But the fundamentals and the concept of crypto is firm and secure. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I am thinking they will take that money and run at some point. Why do you think people are so adamant that it’s a legitimate project? The “CEO” reeks of charlatan. Also, I believe they incorporated a 90% claim tax or something like that to where it’s hard to take money out (not sure if that’s accurate).

I truly feel bad for the investors because from the outside it seems crazy that someone would fall for some of the explanations heard from the Safemoon team regarding certain accusations.

&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The Safemoon army is a passionate bunch. I can appreciate that. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;People that post about Safemoon just want the moons. I was not aware of this. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;There are people that have invested who understood that it was a longshot and invested only what they were willing to lose or made a little money early and got out. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Lots of bots in the Safemoon subreddit.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;
