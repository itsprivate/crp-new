I have been following actively the crypto market for 6 years now (Since I was 18 y/o). The first time I heard about bitcoin I was a 12y/o kid who had just heard about the deep web and how Bitcoin was used to pay for assassinations and drugs and child porn and so on…
Fast forwad to 2018 I thought about buying but Bitcoin had already hit 17k (euros) and was at the time at 6 or 7k. I thought to myself “It dropped from 17k to 6k, that’s no good, besides, 7k is still too much”. Then it dropped to 3k and 2k and I  kind of lost interest, and now I regret not buying and Hodling at the time. However today I can see why Bitcoin is and will always be the number one cryptocurrency. I bought my first satoshi at 39k, I bought more earlier today at 29k and will continue buying every month and Hodl it for a very long long time.
Thank you for reading.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

What new users don&amp;amp;#39;t understand is that these people HAVE SEEN SOME SHIT.    &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Imagine living through not just the Terra/Luna meltdown but also witnessing Bitconect, The DAO hack, Mt Gox, and hundreds of shitcoins, rug pulls, ponzis, and exchange hacks. Imagine getting burned yourself (perhaps several times) and then watching it constantly happen to new people. Imagine how every four years, right after the Bitcoin halvening, all these new people show up with their &amp;amp;quot;new toys&amp;amp;quot;. (2013 alt coins, 2017 icos, 2021 NFTs) and zero experience and stubbornness and watch as they completely ignore the advice from people who have spent years in this space.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitcoin is just different. There is no leader. There is no premine. There is no changing the finite supply or the economic properties. Its real decentralized money and the reason we even understand the word &amp;amp;quot;blockchain&amp;amp;quot; today.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TL;DR: Take your ALGO off exchanges unless you are actively trading. June 5 is the target &amp;amp;quot;date&amp;amp;quot; of the ALGOrun, but really this an ongoing affair. This is good for decentralization of the ALGO chain.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Not long ago, our brethren in Monero staged the Monerun. It was a fantastic move and we applaud you. Also, we are saddened by the news that you all collectively took a boat trip to celebrate and then all lost your keys in a tragic accident. Truly heartbreaking.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyway, like the folks at XMR, we at ALGO are also concerned about fractional reserve trading. But, even more pressing is the issue of exchanges having too much control in our governance program. They pledge your ALGO, then vote them how they see fit. They pocket the rewards and pass scraps on to you. We are fighting back and taking control.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So far, the effort at an ALGOrun has been confined to our little community over at &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/algorand&quot;&amp;gt;r/algorand&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. In that time, we have nonetheless managed to sack two of Binance&amp;amp;#39;s cold wallets and make them forfeit a total of over 154M ALGO from Governance.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is time to spread the word: #weALGOoffexchanges.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What we are trying to accomplish is a run on the exchanges that forces them to forfeit their governance rewards (return more power to holders) or buy OTC to defend their governance position. So, we are now officially on an ALGOrun. From now until &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;June 5th&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, we are pressing all our folks to go off exchanges unless they are actively trading. We have made a stockpile of memes and educational material. We will force every damn exchange we can to quit governance and return control to the Algonauts.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;So...What is the idea here?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Answer: We try to push exchanges out of governance and/or buy ALGO over the counter (OTC) to cover their position. At least 500M Algos in governance belong to exchanges. That means exchanges are voting on governance proposals how they see fit and pocketing the rewards. People don&amp;amp;#39;t realize they can get the same or WAY better rewards on a private wallet that is pledged in governance and actually be able to make their own choices on how Algorand goes forward.. The exchanges have wagered that many Algonauts will remain ignorant of this fact. It is time to we expose this.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Wait, are you saying this is like a short squeeze?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yes. Wallets that pledge and then vote in governance get rewards. Exchanges are using your Algo to do this. They are voting for you (and it may not be a vote that is in your interest) and then pocketing the rewards. They pass on only a portion of it to you. If we withdraw from the exchanges, they will be faced with two options: (1) forfeit governance rewards, which can be millions of dollars; or (2) go buy ALGOs over the counter and drive the price up.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;But can&amp;amp;#39;t the exchanges just freeze withdraws?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yes they can, and many already have. But just keep up with it and withdraw. In the past two days we&amp;amp;#39;ve sacked 154M ALGO from Binance. They had to halt withdrawals while they recharged their hot wallet. First they forfeited 64M Algos from governance. Then they reopened withdrawals. And then, they had to forfeit another 94M.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Why June 5th?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anniversary of the launch of Algorand main net!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Won&amp;amp;#39;t people just front run June 5th? Should I pull my funds sooner than that?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sure. They might. And, you don&amp;amp;#39;t need to wait to withdraw. This is an ongoing movement. June 5 is just an arbitrary day for peak activity if possible. And this isn&amp;amp;#39;t just about price. It&amp;amp;#39;s about decentralization and ensuring people have the power to vote their own ALGO and receive all the rewards for it, to participate in the ecosystem, etc.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Can&amp;amp;#39;t exchanges just frontrun this event too? Stock up on ALGO to avoid forfeiting governance?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sure. If they want to buy ALGO and drive price up, more power to them. The point is to either make them forfeit governance or to make them buy more ALGO. If we are relentless enough, we can make them do both.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Don&amp;amp;#39;t exchanges do this with other coins too?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yes. I have no idea if those other coins have the same economic incentives for exchanges to try to defend their cold wallet positions. But, if you want to do your own &amp;amp;quot;[coin]Run&amp;amp;quot;, you can feel free to do so. I&amp;amp;#39;ll promote that too. We have made a ton of content that you can crib from. This isn&amp;amp;#39;t a coin vs coin battle. This is a people vs institutions battle. We are all on the same side here.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you are interested in contributing to content or seeing the content we have made so far, we have posted a lot of content over at &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/algorand&quot;&amp;gt;r/algorand&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. I refrain from posting it here for fear of  automod. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;From henceforth, the ALGOrun is officially on.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If all that is so obvious now, why couldn&amp;amp;#39;t people see it before the crash? I know people were warning Do Kwon that Luna could be crashed before it happened, but I didn&amp;amp;#39;t get any sentiment that people expected that Luna/UST was going to crash/fail eventually. Did people just not want to believe that such a large crypto could fail or was it less obvious that people make it out to seem now?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So finally he broke the silence and he proposed in a forum discussion about his “recovery plan”.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I am already highly skeptical with the blockchain being salvageable, but looking at this proposal it is very underwhelming.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My opinions on this :&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The proposal assumes that luna and UST still has value.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There doesn’t seem to be any actual fix to the protocol, this is basically just resetting the chain to a more convenient state.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;No mention on how to fix UST. I mean he said to push the fix later, but the counter argument is that the dynamics UST with LUNA is what defines terra, without that terra is just a PoS like avax or Polygon.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

The macro economic factors look bleak. The nasdaq sold off like crazy, including Apple, ostensibly the top dog. One of the “most promising” crypto projects outright failed, alongside its stable coin. A stable coin failing breaches a lot of trust. That and Kwon sold off a ton of BTC (or so I believe, correct me if I’m wrong). I’d expect us to be lower right now.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I’m not saying we’re out of the woods yet. The first signs of Bear Stearns failing happened several months before the whole equity market collapsed. I’m not saying that this will happen, but I’m not naive enough to think it can’t happen either.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After consulting my crystal ball, I definitely think the crypto market will trade down, up, or sideways from here.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Why do you think the market is holding up? Do you also think that we should be trading lower?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

According to Katja Hessel, German Parliamentary State Secretary, crypto traders can get tax exemption benefits on the sale of digital currencies. Furthermore, if they have held onto their assets for one year or more, they will not have to pay taxes on the money they make from the crypto sales.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Federal Finance Ministry of Germany issued 24 pages of guidelines defining blockchain technology ideas like airdrops, staking, masternodes, mining, and tax charges against sales and purchases of cryptocurrencies. If someone doesn’t have to do anything to receive an airdrop, they won’t have to pay income tax on it. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That upward swing was never meant to last, and the deeper we go into the red the more desperate people become and those with weaker hands will inevitably sell while on the red and want to blame it on someone, anyone but themselves, and I guess a celebrity like Matt makes for a good scapegoat.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Which is a shame, because there&amp;amp;#39;s so many celebrities actually scamming people, yet Matt only did an ad for an actual exchange, but that&amp;amp;#39;s just how people are.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As we all know, the crypto-space is flooded by spams, scams, shills, bots etc... and of course, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/CryptoCurrency&quot;&amp;gt;r/CryptoCurrency&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; is no exception.  While most users don&amp;amp;#39;t see this spam due to our bots removing it, this affects our governance token by lowering the ratio as well as the cap, governance is meant to be distributed proportionally to users that contributes to the subreddit, not to bots/shills/scammers. Moderators also have a really hard time catching these users since bots automatically remove their posts/comments.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Solution:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Removing &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;vaultless&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; users with less than 10 karma from the snapshot and distribution.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Pro/cons:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Pro: Higher ratio and karma cap for contributors and more governance available to vote &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Con: Less moons will be burned &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hey hey hey everybody my name is Do Kwon and I am coming from Korea and let me tell you guys that I am so excited, I am so happy, I am really so thrilled to be right now sharing this amazing, glorious, super, and exciting moment of my life with all of you guys, and let me tell you that we are really changing the world as we know it, the world is not anymore the way it used to be, mmm mmm, No! No! No! TERRACONNECT!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Wow! TERRACONNECT! We are coming and we are coming in waves! We are starting and we are watching go all over the world! We are pelting the entire world! Let me tell you guys that I started 137 days ago with only $25,610 and right now I am earning 20% guaranteed yield! Woah woah woah woah woah woah woah Whats up? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And let me tell you that I am actually earning around one hun- I mean $1,400 on an every day basis, seven days a week! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What? I am right now independently, financially independently. I am saying to so many people who say that this was going to be con artist game, that this was gonna be a scammer game, “Hey! You’re gonna lose all your money!” My wife still doesn’t believe in me! I’m telling him “Oh honey, this is real!” “Oh no no no no no, that’s a scam!” And I said “But wait I’m gonna go to the bank and I’m gonna get my UST and I’m actually gonna turn it into dollars, here there right on the table!” “No, that’s money you took from another account!” And I’ll say “What am I gonna do? Then I said to myself, “You know what? When I am starting to put $10,000 a day on her, right on her, you know on her table.” Then she’s gonna say “Woah!” Hahaha! Yo yo yo yo yo! “OK that’s real!” Hahahaha! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So guys, I’m gonna tell you something. Faith and believe is the one thing that we will need to be able to change the world, and right now I believe that in this room, we have the seed that’s gonna germinate and is going to explode into an amazing opportunity for us to change this entire world. I am so proud, I am so honored, I am so excited to be here right now and let me tell you something, that each and every one of you has the opportunity to become like those amazing people that we know here from Vietnam.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So just rewriting history is now a serious option. I am sure this is legal and the exchanges will surely have nothing against this :D&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Honestly why can&amp;amp;#39;t they just stop. This hurts the whole cryptospace and any serious project as long as this is going on. Doing a rollback back to 3 or 4 days ago does not solve ANYTHING it just hurts even more. The legal implications of that would be gigantic, too.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I put $500 into crypto (mostly a bag of ULTRASAFE coin and GenWealth coin and a little bit of PORNROCKET) because $500 was all I could afford. I lost all of that money but it didn&amp;amp;#39;t ruin my life because I followed the advice to not invest more than I could afford to lose.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now I have more money to invest during this dip and I am able to buy coins that will moon on short notice.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After reading the bitcoin whitepaper which outlines how bitcoin was supposed to work, crypto seemed really cool. But the vision of BTC is long dead and it no longer aims to be what it was designed to be.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One things I have to point out though is that &amp;amp;#39;centralization&amp;amp;#39; of control of money is decentralized by having many mining nodes, full nodes that don&amp;amp;#39;t mine add zero value to decentralization.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m interested in a crypto that anyone can use for things, that no one can stop them from using. High fees pretty much make this not possible. Is there anything for me?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

So the simple version is that when someone sells one UST for $0.40 then it creates another 400 LUNA if the price is at $0.001 per LUNA. And if the price is $0.0001 it will create another 4000 LUNA from that one UST.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So it might seem like a great deal and that you are buying the dip 99.99% down but the amount of coins is growing massively too. You can check their API here (link from coingecko)&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://fcd.terra.dev/v1/circulatingsupply/lunaCirculating&quot;&amp;gt;https://fcd.terra.dev/v1/circulatingsupply/lunaCirculating&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; supply is now over 150 billion according to their API. over 3* as many as XRP. This will go to SHIB levels as that previously $13 billion of UST unlocks itself.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyway just a word of caution not to buy the dip becuase it will continue to dilute massively. I already lost some money myself buying the dip until I released how the minting mechanism works. Sorry its like 2 days too late. But hopefully this saves someone from making the same mistake.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Of the $1.25 trillion market cap, Bitcoin dominance is at 44.8%, Ethereum is at 19.3%, and when you account for (still) functioning stablecoins (USDT, USDC, BUSD, DAI) that makes up another 12%. All together, those 3 things make up 76% of the entire crypto marketcap. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Of the remaining 24%, some of the coins that still manage to crack the top 30  include Doge, Shib, XRP, UST (lol), BCH, and ETC.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So what is the takeaway here? After all of this time, the vast majority of the value created in this space has flown into just 2 assets, and 99% of the rest are pretty much dogshit.   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;ve been in the markets since 2017, which hardly makes a hardened crypto alumni, yes somehow still seems to make me older than 95% of this sub, so here is a look back in time for those &amp;amp;quot;new&amp;amp;quot; here...   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is a look at the top 20 coins from the end of 2016, how many do you recognize?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/4w3vo80043z81.png?width=1476&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=720dcd81a56962c01f4a613db44fdeb60d2a7192&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/4w3vo80043z81.png?width=1476&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=720dcd81a56962c01f4a613db44fdeb60d2a7192&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And 2017...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/fmnxubpr33z81.png?width=1508&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=00b217504c9296f6b56c358ab297ed070b4dcace&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/fmnxubpr33z81.png?width=1508&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=00b217504c9296f6b56c358ab297ed070b4dcace&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;and 2018...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/wf3v1k4343z81.png?width=1470&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=0738038a8808ce7375195b0e941041f8d8ab7b62&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/wf3v1k4343z81.png?width=1470&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=0738038a8808ce7375195b0e941041f8d8ab7b62&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I hate when people make these things absurdly long without getting to the point...so here it is....the number of projects we&amp;amp;#39;ve seen come and go, projects that at one time were the darlings of this sub, is honestly laughable. Luna is one more casualty in a long, long list of examples. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The fact is that 99% of crypto investors that have made any sort of real and consistent money over the years have done so by regularly buying Bitcoin and Ethereum, as they can afford to, and then just holding. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is so fucking simple guys, and most of you know this to be true. But every damn year there are some new toys to lose your life savings with, and people fall for it hook, line, and sinker every time. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If the 200% CAGRs of BTC and ETH aren&amp;amp;#39;t good enough for you, and you need to dump everything you&amp;amp;#39;ve got into fucking Willy Wonka coin or something, then godspeed and good luck.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But for those that are here to invest towards a better financial future for yourself and your family, and have the patience and temperance to do it, the writing is clearly on the wall for all of you to read.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I’m not familiar with details of that yet, but read below for my initial post.&amp;lt;/del&amp;gt; The blockchain has resumed without staking&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit2: multiple sources are saying circulating supply is actually 33B+ a 10,000% increase from the prior amount of 343M since May 8th. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;——————&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;ve been following the state of Luna over the last week and have a number of posts on it - with my most recent one from yesterday - warning people not to buy the dip. I&amp;amp;#39;ve been trying to figure out what to expect next and if ever would be a good time to invest in Terra.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What do you need to know -&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;UST and Luna price are directly related - You can burn Luna and mint UST, or you can burn UST and mint Luna. On May 8th (not including any fees you could burn about 60 UST ($60) to get 1 Luna ($60) - when UST started depegging people became financially incentivized to burn UST and convert it to Luna - increasing the supply of Luna. Since demand isn&amp;amp;#39;t keeping up with the increased supply - the price of Luna is continuing to crash.  Currently with 1 UST worth $.55 and 1 Luna worth $.0058 (not including fees you can mint 330.57 Luna for $1 (true dollar) of UST.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Prior to the depeg there was a circulating supply of 18.6B UST. Currently there is a circulating supply of 11.9B UST. Meaning it only took 36% of the supply of UST to drop the price of Terra from $60 to .006. a 99.9999% drop. There is still 64% of the total UST that hasn&amp;amp;#39;t been removed/converted back to Luna. There is still a long.............. way Luna can fall.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Why would someone convert UST back to Luna? Because UST is worth $.55 and it can be converted to $1 of Terra. No guarantee it will be worth that though by the time you get/sell it (you could even lose money trying assuming the price of Terra continues to drop)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://messari.io/asset/terra/chart/sply-circ&quot;&amp;gt;circulating supply of Luna&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; is up  425% in the last three days and likely to increase further and significantly faster as the depeg remains off and money flows out of UST into Terra further exponentially increasing the supply and dropping the price of Terra.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A lot more Terra is being minted for every UST now than yesterday. Yesterday for every $1 (true Dollar) of UST you&amp;amp;#39;d about 1-2 Luna today that&amp;amp;#39;s 330 and it&amp;amp;#39;s going to continue to increase at a faster and faster rate as the price of Luna falls. This is the death spiral of Luna and why investors shouldn&amp;amp;#39;t think they&amp;amp;#39;re getting Luna for cheap.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;If the total marketcap of UST was lower maybe Luna could have survived this above $1 eventually people may have ran out of UST to burn for Luna and maybe you&amp;amp;#39;d be ok buying it in case it ever recovered (this is likely part of why the last two depegs didn&amp;amp;#39;t crush Luna - the marketcap of Luna was still relatively low enough to weather the influx of UST burns.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Speculation. What isn&amp;amp;#39;t clear is will people stop buying Luna. I mean if you get 10,000 Luna for $1 are some people going to buy it in case it ever &amp;amp;quot;recovers?&amp;amp;quot;. If so will the people buying be able to continue to support people in UST trying to get out of the asset, or will people stop buying UST as it adds another 10 decimal points (speculation) if so what happens to the money in UST - 11.9B stuck in UST became worthless if people aren&amp;amp;#39;t buying Luna? Eventually when this is all done with Luna have a future without UST?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;--------------&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;None of this speculation is entirely clear, but what is clear - is.. UST is suffocating Luna and it could potentially become worthless unless people continue to buy Luna despite the number of decimal points it&amp;amp;#39;s going to quickly start adding.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Last note UST has 11.9B stuck in and it&amp;amp;#39;s supported/can be exchanged for Luna which has a marketcap of roughly 16.6M-50M depending on the platform.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Final Final note - some of the numbers are not perfectly correlated in different sections because the price was fluctuating while I was writing this.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;---------------&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TLDR: Be prepared for Luna to drop alot farther $1 can now mint multiple hundreds of Luna and that will likely increase to thousands soon.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

There&amp;amp;#39;s no promise of some complex protocol to come 3, 5, or 10 years down the road. It does what it&amp;amp;#39;s supposed to now without self promotion from the founders. Since it doesn&amp;amp;#39;t need self promotion to thrive, it doesn&amp;amp;#39;t fall victim to the vices of marketing from greedy, charismatic leaders, with overly complex projects. Sure, there&amp;amp;#39;s Saylor and Novogratz that sometimes fall into that role. But bitcoin doesn&amp;amp;#39;t need them to survive and won&amp;amp;#39;t need them when they die. The project works now. It does what it&amp;amp;#39;s supposed to and it&amp;amp;#39;ll continue to do what it&amp;amp;#39;s supposed to.

There&amp;amp;#39;s no J Powell to magically expand the money supply with a cobol fueled wand to create a 9 trillion USD balance sheet.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;BTC takes out the corruption of humans, because the humans that created it stepped away. Sure, people will build corrupt systems around it, but BTC itself is a simple, pure, and elegant vehicle that will silently tick away in the background until the ticking becomes so loud that no one can ignore it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;so yeah we all know that UST has drastically de-pegged.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;most people here believe that Citadel and Gemini or whoever did a coordinated attack to lower its value because they had loans in it (basically shorting it). Not like anyone cares to provide any sort of evidence for that because &amp;amp;quot;trust me bro&amp;amp;quot; is more than sufficient for that.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;other people say that LUNA and its stablecoins were always a ponzi scheme or a rugpull or whichever other words the average redditor wrongly uses as a synonym for any sort of scam, fraud, flaw or loss of value to appear smarter than the Safemoon crowd.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;in reality LUNA and UST are just massive failures due to a pretty significant flaw in the way UST was supposed to keep its peg. thing is its not backed by real USD and its also not overcollateralized, like DAI for example.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;the way algorithmic stablecoins keep their value (or don&amp;amp;#39;t apparently) is that you can always burn them for $1 worth of LUNA. Not for any fixed amount of LUNA, but for whatever amount of LUNA currently has a value of $1.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;this does have the advantage that you don&amp;amp;#39;t rely on a centralized company or on people that take risky DeFi loans to mint the stablecoin. But this completely collapses if too many people cash out at once.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;See you only get 1 US dollar thru that algorithmic approach if you burn 1 UST for LUNA and then sell your LUNA. This is a problem because if LUNA is being sold it is losing value and if masses of people sell it at once it could lose its value faster than you can sell your $1 worth of LUNA for $1. And in that case UST is practically no longer backed by enough value.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Maybe there was an attack, maybe not. That a stablecoin loses its value at any exchange for a short period of time isn&amp;amp;#39;t a problem. That happens all the time, even if only rarely to more than one percent. But that the algorithm that gave UST its value is completely unable to let the UST holders cash out without eating each other alive always made it a ticking time bomb. There is no need for any sort of attack for UST to collapse, this was bound to happen at some point.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At a certain point, I had a large portion of my savings invested and began wondering if everyone was in some sort of fever dream. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I think crypto is clearly the future in certain regards, but it got way too hysterical and manic, which is not good for society or anyone’s time. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We need these massive crashes to weed out all of the scams, in order to make it a viable future.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
