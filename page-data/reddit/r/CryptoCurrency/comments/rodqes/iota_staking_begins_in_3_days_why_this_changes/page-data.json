I know this post is quite provoking. I think it’s not too bad to share your hopium. I hope you learned something new about IOTA and regardless of what you do with these informations, have a wonderful new year and good profits!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;IOTA staking will begin soon and change everything about this coin!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Moon is imminent. IOTA cannot be staked on exchanges, supply on exchanges has dropped massively and will drop even more. Supply decreasing hard, demand equal or rising. Binance has not opened their withdrawals gates yet, but this will likely trigger extreme price action. 50% of IOTA volume is on Binance. Staking begins December 28th. You receive SMR (at least equal potential as Kusama) and ASMB (feeless Metaverse enabler) with basically no downside, huge upside potential.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As of today, about 45% of IOTAs are already waiting for staking to begin, which will happen on December 28th! This number is impressive, but even more impressive, when you keep in mind that Binance has not enabled withdrawals yet! There will be a massive outflow of IOTA coins in the next days / weeks. The only way to stake IOTA is inside their software wallet, Firefly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/vwzte3yh5q781.png?width=186&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=bb45aced12ec12f86f58a86567138daee98ca5ca\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/vwzte3yh5q781.png?width=186&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=bb45aced12ec12f86f58a86567138daee98ca5ca&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;IOTA CANNOT BE STAKED ON ANY EXCHANGES.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Supply on the exchanges will drop even further! There has probably *never* been a timeframe with less IOTA on exchanges, because there never existed any economic reason to do this. It&amp;#39;s worth for any whale, but also for any &amp;#39;small fish&amp;#39; to stake their IOTA. There will be a supply shock in regards to IOTA. This will probably have massive implications on the price in the next *weeks* not *months*.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Economics 101: Supply decreasing by large amounts while demand staying the same, but most likely increasing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just imagine what happens when hype arrives. IOTA is one of the lowest hyped projects, even though it has never been fundamentally in a better shape. A few years ago there were serious doubts on what would happen to the IOTA Foundation financially, because they had to live of selling IOTA on a regular basis. The IF is now financially independent, probably supported by multiple firms, additionally to the multiple funds they receive from the EU or other publicly funded projects. THIS IS HUGE! I cannot stress this enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There have been rumours that exchanges stake their IOTA holdings to keep the rewards to themselves. But what about the rewards? Let&amp;#39;s take at a look at this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now besides the fundamental state of IOTA and the IOTA Foundation.. what about the staking itself?As you might know, you don&amp;#39;t receive IOTAs (as IOTAs supply is finite and already 100% on the market), you receive SMR and ASMB tokens!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;ve never read about these coins, don&amp;#39;t worry, they don&amp;#39;t exist yet. When staking ends, both token will be unlocked and transferred to the stakers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;#39;t be going into technical details, I want to send this message as simple as possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SMR: Shimmer will be a live testnet for IOTA, meaning every upgrade / change coming to IOTA will be battle tested in the real world on Shimmer first. To be honest, I didn&amp;#39;t think this is huge, because why should this have much value? But then I looked at something comparable in the crypto space that is already existing in a similar manner. Polkadot (mainnet) and Kusama (testnet).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Have you seen their price action, if you&amp;#39;re not invested in these?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kusama increased from 1.70$ just at the end of 2019 to 600$ in May this year. It increased 352x fold! SMR will be distributed to the stakers, it&amp;#39;s dollar value will likely be zero or close to zero.  Just imagine what happens, when it gets listed on exchanges! There, the upside is basically endless, with NO DOWNSIDE! Exchanges are already working on ASMB x SMR support, Bitpanda was already confirmed, another big exchange already staked their token themselves. This. Is. HUGE!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ASMB: You might not know it yet, but as Metaverse is hyped to the moon, one Metaverse coin is basically completely left out, that is IOTA. IOTA is a really good Metaverse coin, if not THE metaverse coin. ASMB will unlock even more usecases for IOTA in this space. You will have *FEELESS* *SMART CONTRACTS*, this is *UNIQUE* in the entire crypto space. You do not have to pax XXX$ fees for NFTs just for network fees, you will only need to pay the fee set by the nodes securing the smart contracts. THIS IS EVM COMPATIBLE!!!!!!!!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the past weeks, NFT projects and other Airdrops have been exploding in the IOTA ecosystem, making it really hard to keep an overview over all the different projects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To make things clear, there have never been more stars aligning for IOTAs price to increase and explode than this. The next 3 months will make a lot of people very rich with IOTA, with 2 additional coins with *huge* potential. My guess would be, once Binance allows withdrawals, price action will be imminent. There is not much time left.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Happy staking and merry christmas!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rodqes/iota_staking_begins_in_3_days_why_this_changes/","title":"IOTA staking begins in 3 days, why this changes everything:","tags":["CryptoCurrency","reddit"],"date":"December 26, 2021","dateISO":"2021-12-26T01:38:35.000Z","datetime":"2021-12-26 01:38","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"rodqes","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rodqes/iota_staking_begins_in_3_days_why_this_changes/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rodqes/iota_staking_begins_in_3_days_why_this_changes/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"CryptoCurrency","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency","author":"Trear","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Trear","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Trear","score":177,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"IOTAのステーキング開始は3日後、これがすべてを変える理由。","the_new_excerpt":"EDIT: これから寝るので、喧嘩が起きないことを祈ります。\nのコメントがあります。この記事はかなり挑発的な内容だと思いますが 共有するのは悪くないと思います。\nあなたのホピウム IOTAについて何か新しいことを学んでいただけたらと思いますし、何を学ぶかは別として\n今年もよろしくお願いします。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"IOTA订金在3天后开始，为什么这改变了一切。","the_new_excerpt":"编辑：我现在要去睡觉了，希望不要在评论中发生争吵。\n评论。我知道这个帖子很有煽动性。我认为分享你的希望不是太坏。\n你的希望。我希望你能学到一些关于IOTA的新东西，不管你用这些信息做什么\n你用这些信息做什么，祝你有一个美好的新年......","locale":"zh"},{"title":"IOTA訂金在3天后開始，爲什麼這改變了一切。","the_new_excerpt":"編輯：我現在要去睡覺了，希望不要在評論中發生爭吵。\n評論。我知道這個帖子很有煽動性。我認爲分享你的希望不是太壞。\n你的希望。我希望你能學到一些關於IOTA的新東西，不管你用這些信息做什麼\n你用這些信息做什麼，祝你有一個美好的新年......","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-roekla","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/roekla/las_staples_center_becomes_cryptocom_arena/","title":"L.A.'s Staples Center Becomes Crypto.com Arena","date":"December 25, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"L.A.のステイプルズセンターがCrypto.comアリーナになる","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"洛杉矶的斯台普斯中心成为Crypto.com竞技场","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"洛杉磯的斯臺普斯中心成爲Crypto.com競技場","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-rohuc5","excerpt":"“I put all my life savings into bitcoins\n\nLast week, I put all my life savings into Bitcoin.
