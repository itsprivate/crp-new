But why is this and will it continue and for how long? Here are a few reasons why. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Omicron Variant&lt;/strong&gt; \nThe stock market has taken a major hit recently because of the omicron variant. People are getting sick and some are afraid. Fear and uncertainty are never a good combination within a market which is why we’re seeing a dip (or a crash I don’t mind what one you choose).  In my country for example, the UK, cases are rising sharply and we could see a lockdown come in on Boxing Day. People don’t like news like this and become show their paper hands. The stock market directly affects the crypto market, therefore stocks are down so crypto is down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crypto Currency Regulations&lt;/strong&gt;\nLately law makers in the US have been debating bringing in new legislation for cryptocurrency and having tighter regulations on it. Under a potential new law that has been considered by lawmakers, companies that facilitate crypto trades would be required to report tax information about those trades to the IRS (just as brokers of traditional investments like stocks do) starting in the 2024 tax season. They have also expressed their concern about the crime in cryptocurrency, this is a very unpopular topic among this community so please don’t shoot the messenger, stating that by bypassing the involvement of U.S. dollars in direct crypto-to-crypto trades, bad actors may be more able to evade public policy measures and other sanctions aimed at preventing money laundering or ensuring tax compliance. Hence their want for tighter restraints on stable coins which they want to treat more like banks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China&lt;/strong&gt;\nI have only recently learned this from a post on this sub today. China’s cryptocurrency ban from earlier this year has a delayed reinforcement. Meaning that popular exchanges in that country such as Binance have until the end of December to repay investors and liquidate assets. This has caused a lot of the bleeding at the minute as presumably hundreds of thousands of accounts are being emptied. I am curious as to if Chinese investors will stay away from cryptocurrency permanently or if this law will only take effect for the short term before people start ignoring it, similar to their recent gaming legislation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that’s it, what I believe to be the biggest factors in what is happening right now. If you wish to correct me on anything or add to what I am saying please write a comment and fill me in. Thanks for taking time out of your day to read this, have a great Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rkw8qy/will_the_market_keep_bleeding_for_the_foreseeable/","title":"Will the market keep bleeding for the foreseeable future?","tags":["CryptoCurrency","reddit"],"date":"December 21, 2021","dateISO":"2021-12-21T04:44:36.000Z","datetime":"2021-12-21 04:44","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"rkw8qy","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rkw8qy/will_the_market_keep_bleeding_for_the_foreseeable/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rkw8qy/will_the_market_keep_bleeding_for_the_foreseeable/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"CryptoCurrency","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency","author":"Ben_Dover1234","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ben_Dover1234","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Ben_Dover1234","score":152,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"市場は当分出血し続けるのでしょうか？","the_new_excerpt":"年の瀬を迎え、相場は下降線をたどっていることはご承知の通りです。\nこの数週間、私たちのEOY予測は見事に外れてしまいました。しかし、なぜ\nそして、それはいつまで続くのでしょうか。その理由をいくつか挙げてみよう。\n\nオミクロンバリアント 株式市場は大きな打撃を受けた...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"在可预见的未来，市场是否会一直流血？","the_new_excerpt":"随着年末的到来，我们都知道，市场在过去的一年中一直处于低迷状态。\n过去几周，我们的年终预测已经落空了。但为什么\n是什么原因，它将持续多久？这里有几个原因。\n\n欧米茄变体 股市已经遭受了重大打击。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"在可預見的未來，市場是否會一直流血？","the_new_excerpt":"隨着年末的到來，我們都知道，市場在過去的一年中一直處於低迷狀態。\n過去幾周，我們的年終預測已經落空了。但爲什麼\n是什麼原因，它將持續多久？這裏有幾個原因。\n\n歐米茄變體 股市已經遭受了重大打擊。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-rkqsfa","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rkqsfa/crypto_whale_suddenly_moves_over_500000000_worth/","title":"Crypto Whale Suddenly Moves Over $500,000,000 Worth of Bitcoin in a Single Transaction - The Whales are moving","date":"December 21, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Crypto Whale、突如として1回の取引で5億円以上のビットコインを動かす - クジラが動き出す","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"Crypto Whale突然在一次交易中转移了价值超过500,000,000美元的比特币 - 鲸鱼正在移动","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"Crypto Whale突然在一次交易中轉移了價值超過500,000,000美元的比特幣 - 鯨魚正在移動","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-rkxb9r","excerpt":"Here are some rules I have created and learned from others.
