In usual business logic, if user want a certain smart contract to have certain token, what they should do, and the way the Smart Contract should absolutely implement is: user approve in ERC-20 token contract first, then you make user to call a function exposed by your Contract, in the function, your Contract calls &lt;em&gt;transferFrom&lt;/em&gt; function on ERC-20 Token Contract, so that your contract is aware of this transfer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An ERC-20 &lt;em&gt;transfer&lt;/em&gt; function call, to ANY &lt;strong&gt;CONTRACT&lt;/strong&gt; ADDRESS, initiated by END-USER (EOA address), is POINTLESS and will ALWAYS result in PERMANENT, UNRECOVEABLE TOKEN LOSS.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;#39;s tragedy is caused by collective effect of many factor: The nature of Ethereum that all addresses look the same; Lack of user education on smart contract (I see why people blaming &lt;a href=\"https://weth.io/\"&gt;weth.io&lt;/a&gt; on this, it&amp;#39;s fully reasonable, today&amp;#39;s victim might came up with the idea him/herself that: hey I send ETH to the contract, got WETH, now I send WETH back, ETH back, that&amp;#39;s what the GIF on &lt;a href=\"https://weth.io/\"&gt;weth.io&lt;/a&gt; says! completely not knowing what&amp;#39;s under the hood, the anonymous fallback function and etc.). Lack of on-chain logic checking and preventing this (it would cost everybody&amp;#39;s gas).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the most unforgivable factor is the NEGLIGENCE of wallet software: &lt;strong&gt;ZERO&lt;/strong&gt; warning upon sending ERC-20 token to a Contract Address, on the UI I just saw &amp;quot;Contract interaction: Transfer&amp;quot;, and I&amp;#39;m good to go! To PURGE ALL OF MY HODLING with single mouse click!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s not how fault tolerance/fault proof should be done - to be honest, that&amp;#39;s zero fault proof.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Green across the board, we are good to go right? POOOOF, SNAFU, a poor guy&amp;#39;s life saving gone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This issue has been around for years, and of course, everything on chain is accessible, &lt;a href=\"https://etherscan.io/\"&gt;etherscan.io&lt;/a&gt; can tell if an address is a contract, Infura can tell if it&amp;#39;s a contract. But metamask, ledger live, xxx wallet and etc cannot tell if the address in the text input is a contract.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, once again in the end, We should start a campaign, here is our appeal:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;All wallet software orienting average user, shall ban the action of, or give the scariest warning it can give if the user initiates a tx that directly calls &lt;em&gt;transfer&lt;/em&gt; function to a Contract address.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We should promote and accelerate the deprecation of raw ERC-20, and the wider adoption of newer, more robust and fault-proof ERC-777 and ERC-1555 standards.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON
