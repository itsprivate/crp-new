Let me get that straight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I always thought I invested only what I can &amp;#39;afford&amp;#39; to lose. I did not need the money at that time and I was working so I had a steady income as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When prices started dropping I realized I was checking the charts quite a lot. It was the last thing I did before going to sleep and the first thing I did when I woke up. The prices going down were nagging at me a lot more than I anticipated at first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I decided to take out my initial investment and some extra profits if I wanted to go on a vacation with some friends. Since I did that, I barely check the charts anymore and to be honest I feel no stress at all when prices drop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This made me wonder how many of you their mental health truly stays unaffected by the prices dropping and truly invested only what you can &amp;#39;afford&amp;#39; to lose?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 1: I’m trying to reply to everyone but damn you all are going hard with the replies!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: I agree “afford” to lose is a really ambiguous and weird term.
