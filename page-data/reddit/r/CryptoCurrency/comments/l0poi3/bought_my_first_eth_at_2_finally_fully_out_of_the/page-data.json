Started buying Ethereum at just above $2 in early 2016 after missing the boat on Bitcoin. I put my whole tax return in in 2016 and threw a couple hundred at it whenever I could. I didn&#39;t buy a car and biked to work to save money. I remember at the time thinking there was about a 1/3 chance it would 100x, so there was an asymmetrical risk/reward in my opinion. </p>\n\n<p>Sold a large chunk during the previous bull run in 2017, and sold the remaining in multiple sales this January. Averaged about a 150x on my cost basis across all sales. All long-term capital gains. Now I&#39;m 27 and financially independent. Will be buying my parents a house this year.</p>\n\n<p>I love this community and hope both the technology and price continues to improve. Thanks to everyone for making this a fun ride!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/l0poi3/bought_my_first_eth_at_2_finally_fully_out_of_the/","title":"Bought My First ETH at $2.
