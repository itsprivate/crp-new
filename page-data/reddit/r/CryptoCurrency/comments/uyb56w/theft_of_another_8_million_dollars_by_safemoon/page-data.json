It&amp;#39;s locked til 2025.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#39;s one of several LP&amp;#39;s, which aren&amp;#39;t locked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;They moved from V1 token to V2, with a new unaudited contract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The moving process is widely considered a honeypot, with investor losses tallying over $5m due to being taxed 100% if you don&amp;#39;t move in exactly the right way.&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/uigey5/4899739_a_complete_view_of_the_safemoon_v1_100/\"&gt;(see previous post)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So May 11th was a very perilous time for Safemoon holders. Amidst the deepening bear market and failure of the Mandala launch (&lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/STK65dO\"&gt;$17 bucks in 24hr volume&lt;/a&gt;), Safemoon&amp;#39;s token price had dropped 48% in week to make a new low on the 11th of just $0.000289 per token (a 98% loss from the V1 ATH of $0.014 - price adjusted for V2)  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Safemoon LLC posted this statement;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/923316772227153957/974075451888767046/FSgkCRvWQAEDySj.jpg?width=1618&amp;amp;height=910\"&gt;In connection with the migration of SFMV1 to SFMV2, SafeMoon is seeking to migrate BNB held in LPs associated with SFMV1 into LPs associated with SFMV2. In connection with that migration, SafeMoon may from time to time acquire SFMV2 in the open market, subject to market conditions and other factors.&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of a sudden, Safemoon pumped 274% in a few hours.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;What the fuck happened there?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You know that locked Liquidity pool? That&amp;#39;s only half the story. There are many other unlocked LP&amp;#39;s, and the Safemoon developers have been dipping their dirty little hands in and scooping out the liquidity.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let&amp;#39;s be clear here.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;SAFEMOON LLC ARE THE CUSTODIANS OF THESE FUNDS, THEY DO NOT OWN THESE TOKENS&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Safemoon LLC, and other Cryptocurrency tokens (in the DeFi space or otherwise) get funds like this:  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Pre-sale - selling minted tokens directly for ETH, BNB etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Selling tokens minted throughout the token&amp;#39;s life&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Collecting fees etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With Safemoon LLC, they held a &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Fair Launch&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot; where tokens were not advertised in any capacity and yet they managed to secure thousands of dollars worth of BNB. They also have the famed 10% buy and 10% sell tax, where a portion of fees are allocated to devs. Other than that, they have no other ways to accumulate funds.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Apart from the liquidity pool.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When people buy and sell Safemoon, it&amp;#39;s done through the liquidity pool which contains a pairing of tokens. X Safemoon per 1 BNB, which dictates the price. Those tokens come from the community. They are not Safemoon LLC&amp;#39;s tokens. When Safemoon sells Mike 1,000,000 Safemoon tokens, and then Mike sells those tokens for 1 BNB to someone else, Safemoon LLC doesn&amp;#39;t own that 1,000,000 Safemoon or the 1 BNB.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h4&gt;Within minutes of posting the above on Twitter &amp;amp; Discord, Safemoon LLC started dumping V1 tokens by the trillions.&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here is one such transaction, the wallet ending in 76bc is known as the &amp;quot;CFO wallet&amp;quot; (and since Safemoon has no CFO any more, it&amp;#39;s John Karony the CEO)  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://bscscan.com/tx/0x1bdf563996ead8cc0c915d109f91ac96e3798b5b4c07b801d279944a76432b91\"&gt;In this transaction, 2.4 Trillion V1 Tokens were swapped for 883 BNB worth $276.8K.&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In total, this wallet extracted 37 Trillion V1 tokens and 22,894 BNB from the unlocked V1 Liquidity pool, in addition to &lt;a href=\"https://bscscan.com/tx/0x79ce08720b3ab4507bd036a43a2c2f9274eb2156dc3d0622647746ada9defd80\"&gt;withdrawing 2,296 BNB from a Binance Hot Wallet&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s 25,190 BNB.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;$7,896,480&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And what was done with this BNB? Minutes after accumulating $8 Million bucks of investors money, Safemoon LLC bought  7,965,639,635 Safemoon V2 tokens on the open market, spiking the price up nearly 4x over, which of course...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/mvBBDMa.png\"&gt;A whale immediately took advantage of and thanked John &amp;amp; Co. for the exit liquidity.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem here is that Safemoon LLC neglected to move the LP in a proper manner. They could have just withdrawn the BNB &amp;amp; V1 tokens, burned the V1 as they&amp;#39;re obsolete, then simply deposited the BNB in the V2 Liquidity Pool.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead, the CEO chose to buy V2 tokens on the open market - inflating the price of the asset, while securing almost 8 Billion V2 tokens for himself. The CEO has therefore enriched himself at the holders expense.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/SafeMoon/comments/unr2is/believe_in_john_believe_in_his_team_i_told_you/\"&gt;And yet, all over Twitter, Reddit &amp;amp; Discord, folks are praising him for &amp;quot;4D Chess&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;WARNING: Link will melt your brain&lt;/strong&gt;. Their CEO has enriched himself using money that should be meant for the liquidity pool, provided exit liquidity for a whale and opened themselves up to even more legal action. And they are thanking him for it.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/84tbhiiiauz81.jpg?width=1024&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9adb13d58c9a8a782a5b60811c85235ff1dd6f0b\"&gt;Oh, and he clearly has no intention of returning it to all the poor people who lost their funds on the ruthless 100% tax.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Insane.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/uyb56w/theft_of_another_8_million_dollars_by_safemoon/","title":"Theft of *another* $8 Million Dollars by Safemoon CEO, and holders are thanking him for it.","tags":["CryptoCurrency","reddit"],"date":"May 27, 2022","dateISO":"2022-05-27T04:00:58.000Z","datetime":"2022-05-27 04:00","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"uyb56w","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/uyb56w/theft_of_another_8_million_dollars_by_safemoon/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/uyb56w/theft_of_another_8_million_dollars_by_safemoon/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"CryptoCurrency","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency","author":"TNGSystems","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/TNGSystems","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"TNGSystems","score":306,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"SafemoonのCEOがまたもや$8Million Dollarsを盗み、ホルダーは彼に感謝している。","the_new_excerpt":"暗号市場を長年見てきた中で、これはおそらく最も奇妙なことです。\nな出来事でした。\n\n私は、ふわふわしたものを追加することなく、超速いキャッチアップをしようとします。\n\n * Safemoonは「ロックされた」流動性プールを持っています。\n   BNBやSafemoonのトークンを引き出すことはできません。2025年までロックされています。\n   \n *...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"Safemoon公司的首席执行官又偷了*800万美元，而持有人却在感谢他。","the_new_excerpt":"在我观察加密货币市场的这么多年里，这可能是我所见过的最奇怪的\n这可能是我见过的最奇怪的事情。\n\n我将尝试做一个超级快速的追问，不加任何赘述。\n\n *Safemoon有一个 \"锁定 \"的流动性池，这意味着他们不能随便提取\n   BNB或Safemoon代币。它被锁定到2025年。\n   \n *...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Safemoon公司的首席執行官又偷了*800萬美元，而持有人卻在感謝他。","the_new_excerpt":"在我觀察加密貨幣市場的這麼多年裏，這可能是我所見過的最奇怪的\n這可能是我見過的最奇怪的事情。\n\n我將嘗試做一個超級快速的追問，不加任何贅述。\n\n *Safemoon有一個 \"鎖定 \"的流動性池，這意味着他們不能隨便提取\n   BNB或Safemoon代幣。它被鎖定到2025年。\n   \n *...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-uy41r1","excerpt":"I'm sure most of you have heard about what's been going on in crypto the last\nfew days.
