I mean what I’m about to say as genuine advice, not to make fun of anyone, but a lot of people here really need to take a step back and look at the bigger picture. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every day we have people stressing and speculating over the day-to-day movements of their crypto, panicking over bear markets, asking “where should I invest this spare $50?!” in the daily. When in reality, they could see their portfolio do a 2x by working a few solid minimum wage shifts and dumping the paycheck into crypto. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A nice 20% pump on the $100 you invested in your favourite alt-coin which you spent hours researching, still only leaves you with $20 profit. You could probably ask your mom for $20 and she’d give it to you. It might be a harsh truth, but crypto isn’t a life-changing opportunity until you’re working with a decent stack of money, until then, conventional money-making methods are faster and more lucrative (without the potential downside of investing!)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It’s not what you want to hear, but a couple hundred dollars in the market isn’t going to make you financially free unless you’re the crypto-embracing, second coming of Warren Buffett. Grinding out a real life job and dumping that money into crypto? That might just do the trick though.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important disclaimer/reminder:&lt;/strong&gt; I mean ZERO hate to small time investors whatsoever with this post. You guys are learning essential lessons and gaining investing experience without the risk and potential downside of others with more skin in the game, and most importantly, small amounts of money can mean a hell of a lot more to some people than others. I’m simply saying look at the bigger picture, and make the most of your time. Crypto becomes more rewarding the more you can safely invest into it, typical jobs might not have the potential of crypto, but they will build you a base and give you a start way faster and safer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/sbk7jo/i_mean_this_in_the_absolute_nicest_way_possible/","title":"I mean this in the absolute nicest way possible, but some of you just need to get a job","tags":["CryptoCurrency","reddit"],"date":"January 24, 2022","dateISO":"2022-01-24T13:31:00.000Z","datetime":"2022-01-24 13:31","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"sbk7jo","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/sbk7jo/i_mean_this_in_the_absolute_nicest_way_possible/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/sbk7jo/i_mean_this_in_the_absolute_nicest_way_possible/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"CryptoCurrency","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency","author":"RyanShieldsy","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/RyanShieldsy","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"RyanShieldsy","score":865,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"私は可能な限り最も良い方法でこれを意味する、しかし、あなたのうちのいくつかは、仕事を得る必要があります。","the_new_excerpt":"このサブのかなりの部分が小口投資家であることは周知の事実である。\nを作るにはお金がかかるということも周知の事実です。\nお金になります。これから言うことは、純粋なアドバイスであって、馬鹿にすることではありません。\nでも、ここにいる多くの人たちは、本当に一歩下がって...。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"我的意思是，这绝对是最好的方式，但你们中的一些人只需要找一份工作。","the_new_excerpt":"这个子的很大一部分是小型投资者，这不是什么秘密。\n虽然不是鼓舞人心的，但也不是什么秘密，它需要钱来赚取\n赚钱。我的意思是，我所说的是真正的建议，不是要取笑谁。\n但这里的很多人真的需要退一步，并...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我的意思是，這絕對是最好的方式，但你們中的一些人只需要找一份工作。","the_new_excerpt":"這個子的很大一部分是小型投資者，這不是什麼祕密。\n雖然不是鼓舞人心的，但也不是什麼祕密，它需要錢來賺取\n賺錢。我的意思是，我所說的是真正的建議，不是要取笑誰。\n但這裏的很多人真的需要退一步，並...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-sbfvbs","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/Bitcoin/comments/sbfvbs/i_live_by_this_quote_it_has_served_me_well_in_the/","title":"I live by this quote, it has served me well in the past and will again.
