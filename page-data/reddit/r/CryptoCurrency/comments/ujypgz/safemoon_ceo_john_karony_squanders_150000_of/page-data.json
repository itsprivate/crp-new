He also attended Austin SXSW and received an exclusive NFT that is transferred to your wallet for attendees only.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This (among other evidence) was the smoking gun and confirmed John&amp;#39;s ownership of said wallet, &lt;strong&gt;which was previously highlighted as problematic as it has been receiving millions of dollars from Bitmart which was supposed to be sent to the liquidity pool&lt;/strong&gt;, and yet these funds are being withdrawn as cash or spent on frivolous items.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With that out the way, we know that Karony owns this wallet, &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/6zSJko3\"&gt;and he received a tip off from the slimy Ben Phillips&lt;/a&gt; to buy some shitcoin called &amp;quot;Stonks&amp;quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://bscscan.com/token/0xb966150c7a0150ed4ea979e04f18d109301aab95?a=0xd51d1d5503dcff819e214faa66c3b6f0ebb06abe\"&gt;On that same day, Karony bought $150,000 worth of Stonks&lt;/a&gt;, becoming the 2nd largest token holder.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, John&amp;#39;s investing savvy is secondly only to his FUD-fighting savvy, and his FUD-fighting savvy is fucking awful, and so I regret to say that his $150,000 worth of Stonks tokens are now... alas...  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;$5,107.46..&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;That&amp;#39;s a 96.6% loss.&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If this was his own money, who gives a shit. But to actually misuse taxed funds from investors which was supposed to go into the liquidity pool to help secure price stability of Safemoon, in order to buy cringey worthless NFT&amp;#39;s and hundreds of thousands of dollars of shit tokens is a new low.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Especially considering Safemoon currently has a very serious liquidity issue. With just over $6m in BNB liquidity left, it only takes a couple whales to drain the LP and slam the door shut on everyone else.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A bank run is a comin&amp;#39;!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ujypgz/safemoon_ceo_john_karony_squanders_150000_of/","title":"Safemoon CEO John Karony squanders $150,000 of Investor funds on a shitcoin, now worth $5,000 -
