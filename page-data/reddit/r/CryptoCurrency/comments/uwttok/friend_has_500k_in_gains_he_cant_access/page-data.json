But I&amp;#39;m no crypto expert and don&amp;#39;t trade any. I figured I&amp;#39;d come here and ask the best. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/a3SJNMh\"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; are a few screenshots showing the balance and the &amp;quot;support teams&amp;quot; response in order to withdrawal it all. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They claim he needs to pay $62,000 in taxes from his own money separate from the balance in his account in order to withdraw.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here is where I come in. He calls &lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt; asking if he can borrow $62,000. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I told him I don&amp;#39;t have the money simply because if it sounds too good to be true it probably is and I&amp;#39;m not taking that loss.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Name of the exchange is &lt;del&gt;Coinlist&lt;/del&gt; Coinlistxrt&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: He put in 200k of his own money to grow it to 500k.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 3: Overwhelmingly everyone agrees it is a scam some saying they have seen it before. Honestly, I feel terrible for him. He invested 200k and as it seems like that money is forever lost. That&amp;#39;s some nightmare fuel. That being said if you are going to invest 200K into &lt;strong&gt;ANYTHING&lt;/strong&gt; you should know it better inside and out than your ex-wife.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 4: Press F&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 5: Norton Safe Web Report courtesy of &lt;a href=\"/u/Admirable_Ad1430\"&gt;u/Admirable_Ad1430&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://safeweb.norton.com/report/show?name=coinlistxrt.com\"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; for Coinlistxrt. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 6: Some people have brought to my attention that the URL for the official CoinList is not the same URL as in the screenshot. The official Coinlist domain is coinlist.co and the one in the screenshot is coinlistxrt.com&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 7: Turns out while Coinlist has a terrible reputation it is not the exchange he was scammed through. Looks to me like he joined Coinlistxrt which is an imitation of the official Coinlist.co site. Thanks to those who pointed that out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 8: Thank you for everyone who offered their support and helped out with this. This was my first post in CryptoCurrency and I want to say you all are awesome. I need to get back to work now. Thank you again!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/uwttok/friend_has_500k_in_gains_he_cant_access/","title":"Friend has 500k in gains he can't access.","tags":["CryptoCurrency","reddit"],"date":"May 24, 2022","dateISO":"2022-05-24T19:34:22.000Z","datetime":"2022-05-24 19:34","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"uwttok","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/uwttok/friend_has_500k_in_gains_he_cant_access/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/uwttok/friend_has_500k_in_gains_he_cant_access/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"CryptoCurrency","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency","author":"Valantia","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Valantia","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Valantia","score":320,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"友人がアクセスできない50万円の利益を持っている。","the_new_excerpt":"まず第一に、これは完全な詐欺のように思えます。しかし、私は暗号の専門家ではないし\n取引はしません。私はここに来て、最高の尋ねるだろうと思った。\n\nここに[https://imgur.com/a/a3SJNMh]残高を示すいくつかのスクリーンショットがあります。\nそれをすべて撤回するために、 \"サポートチーム \"の応答。\n\n彼らは彼が必要と主張している...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"朋友有50万的收益，他无法获取。","the_new_excerpt":"首先，这在我看来是一个完全的骗局。但我不是加密货币专家，而且\n不做任何交易。我想我应该来这里问最好的人。\n\n这里[https://imgur.com/a/a3SJNMh]有几张截图，显示余额和\n支持团队 \"的回应，以撤销这一切。\n\n他们声称他需要...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"朋友有50萬的收益，他無法獲取。","the_new_excerpt":"首先，這在我看來是一個完全的騙局。但我不是加密貨幣專家，而且\n不做任何交易。我想我應該來這裏問最好的人。\n\n這裏[https://imgur.com/a/a3SJNMh]有幾張截圖，顯示餘額和\n支持團隊 \"的回應，以撤銷這一切。\n\n他們聲稱他需要...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-uwsua2","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/Bitcoin/comments/uwsua2/dont_let_your_local_fiat_currency_drag_you_down/","title":"Don't let your local fiat currency drag you down","date":"May 24, 2022","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ローカル不換紙幣に足を引っ張られないために","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"不要让你的本地法定货币拖累你","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"不要讓你的本地法定貨幣拖累你","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1529167085665910784","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1529167085665910784/","title":"#Bitcoin jumped after 2020 halving, as predicted.
