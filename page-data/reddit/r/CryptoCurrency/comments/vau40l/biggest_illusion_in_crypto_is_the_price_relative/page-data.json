This is in fact manipulation and not &amp;quot;retail fomoing in&amp;quot;. Then it slowly bleeds for 3-4 years. The reason for this is so that when whales want to sell off they will have plenty of liquidity for their price target, say about 30%-50% of that ATH. They need retail to buy their bags that they slowly sell off, while retail says &amp;quot;buy the dip, omg 50% off, you begged for these prices, etc...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This false idea that retail is getting a good deal psychological hurts them since they will keep buying&amp;quot;high&amp;quot; which just leads to more losses. But then the price will drop more leading them to question how can this coin drop another 50% from where i bought, it already dropped 75%, something must be wrong with this coin, I should sell, which further drops the price and affects those other dip buyers. However, they failed to look at the price of the coin 2 years ago which was probably $0.005 and now they are buying at $0.10 from a top of $0.80 but they think this is a good deal, when in fact the coin will bottom at like $0.02. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right now the sentiment is, keep buying, this is a steal, you&amp;#39;ll be so happy you bought now, but the most likely outcome is coins are now still in the zone for whales to keep dumping. They need you BUYING for liquidity and then after that it&amp;#39;s just gonna stay flat, then people will lose interest and it will keep dropping. You have to remember us shrimp barely affect these $B mcap coins, whales run the show, and now they are cashing out on us. They are not buying, they are selling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In a price perspective to evaluate a good deal, look at the price of the coin a couple years ago to its low, then its new ATH and see where is can sorta fall in the middle. For example ETH bottomed at ~$90 during the covid crash, then topped at $~5k. So right now people are saying $1400 is a great deal. Well $1400 is still very high from that last bottom but not that far down from the top. So a good deal relative to all prices is around $500-$700.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So remember look at both the coins ATH &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; its previous low to figure out if its a good buying opportunity. If you look at just the ATH its most likely a manipulated ATH price and the discount you&amp;#39;re seeing is an illusion.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/vau40l/biggest_illusion_in_crypto_is_the_price_relative/","title":"Biggest illusion in crypto is the price relative to a manipulated ATH","tags":["CryptoCurrency","reddit"],"date":"June 13, 2022","dateISO":"2022-06-13T10:34:37.000Z","datetime":"2022-06-13 10:34","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"vau40l","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/vau40l/biggest_illusion_in_crypto_is_the_price_relative/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/vau40l/biggest_illusion_in_crypto_is_the_price_relative/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"CryptoCurrency","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency","author":"tranceology3","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/tranceology3","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"tranceology3","score":320,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"暗号の最大の錯覚は、操作されたATHに対する相対的な価格である。","the_new_excerpt":"人々が陥る最大の誤解の1つは、あるコインがATHに比べてどれだけ低いか、そしてその差が「お得」であるか\nその差が「良い取引」であるということです。\n\n過去の強気相場と弱気相場のチャートを見ると、コインが10倍から100倍になるのがわかります。\n数ヶ月のうちに10倍から100倍に跳ね上がるのがわかると思います。これは...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"加密货币中最大的幻觉是相对于被操纵的ATH的价格","the_new_excerpt":"人们最大的误解之一是一个硬币与它的ATH相比有多低。\n与它的ATH相比有多低，而这种差异就是 \"好交易\"。\n\n如果你看一下过去的牛市和熊市之后的所有图表\n你会看到硬币在几个月内上涨了10-20-100倍。这是在...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"加密貨幣中最大的幻覺是相對於被操縱的ATH的價格","the_new_excerpt":"人們最大的誤解之一是一個硬幣與它的ATH相比有多低。\n與它的ATH相比有多低，而這種差異就是 \"好交易\"。\n\n如果你看一下過去的牛市和熊市之後的所有圖表\n你會看到硬幣在幾個月內上漲了10-20-100倍。這是在...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-vb68qn","excerpt":"For real, this whole space is absolutely ridiculous.
