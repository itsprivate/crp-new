I was recently reminded again why Ticketmaster is one of the most hated company in the world. I wish them a quick bankruptcy. I bought tickets for a concert and the tickets fees were more than 75% of the original ticket price. Which is absurd. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The internet is full of people complaining about Ticketmaster and their fees. For instance this hilariours woman:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Why are Badbunny tickets so expensive? Y’all making me want to sell pictures of my husbands feet on only fans – frustrated Ticketmaster customer&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@_j_e_n_n_/video/6950782961763601670?is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1\"&gt;https://www.tiktok.com/@_j_e_n_n_/video/6950782961763601670?is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the “Last Week Tonight” show, John Oliver explained the shady behavior of Ticketmaster in an entertaining way, including clips of frustrated Ticketmaster customers (like the one above). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A short recap:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Average prices of tickets have more than tripled, since the 1990s (even before tickets hit the resale market)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Ticket fees are determined in collaboration with Ticketmaster’s clients (Venues, Promoters, sometimes the artists)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- These other parties that share in the tickets fees are mostly owned by… Ticketmaster&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Ticketmaster facilitates professional scalpers and multiple account use&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- In some cases less than 8% of all tickets for shows of major artists gets sold directly to the public. Where do the rest of the tickets go? To professional ticket scalpers&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Professional scalpers represent the overwhelming majority of sellers on secondary market places&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Scalpers mark-up the price  on average with 49%, but sometimes even hike up the price more than 10x&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Secondary markets charge exorbitant fees&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The result of this is that the ticketing industry is very inefficient. Parties that do not create any value for fans and artists receive a big cut of the revenue &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_Y7uqqEFnY\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_Y7uqqEFnY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can blockchain technology improve the ticketing industry?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Blockchains are transparent and immutable. Scammy practices such as direct selling on secondary markets or selling huge amounts of tickets to professional scalpers will be visible to fans&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Smart contracts can be programmed with a maximum resale price or maximum mark-up from the original price &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Blockchain cut out the middle men allowing artist to sell more directly to fans&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Tickets can include a royalty fee for artists, when tickets are sold resold (similar to royalty fees on NFT art). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- NFT tickets become tradeable digital collectibles, allowing artists to interact with their fans even after the event&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;R.I.P. Ticketsmaster. I hope we will soon be able to buy tickets for our favourite artists without ridiculous ticket fees.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/txjbsr/ticketmaster_is_scum_i_hope_they_get_destroyed_by/","title":"Ticketmaster is scum.
