For everyone not being aware of what happened, here&amp;#39;s the TL;DR: &amp;quot;A new project (OpenDAO) did an airdrop of their SOS-tokens to everyone that was using OpenSea in the past. Users who used it more and had higher transaction volumes, received more tokens.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, what&amp;#39;s so exciting about that? First, this airdrop was only possible because of the transparancy of a Blockchain. Without it, the OpenDAO would not have been able to verify which person is eligible to how many tokens. Second, they didn&amp;#39;t have to ask OpenSea whether they could have this data but just took it from the Blockchain itself. Third, they reached critical mass within a few hours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In this new world, there will be no gatekeepers and de facto entry barriers into a new market (as we have with today&amp;#39;s platform business models in the digital space). With a single line of code (well, it were a bit more) OpenDAO reached every single OpenSea user overnight. If they would - for example - create a better marketplace for NFTs, people can switch over to them with one click (it&amp;#39;s not yet that easy because OpenSea fucked up the &amp;quot;saving&amp;quot; of the NFT data). It doesn&amp;#39;t matter on which &amp;quot;platform island&amp;quot; you are. They&amp;#39;re all connected via bridges with each other.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like if a random guy could come along, program an Instagram-like social media application in a more decentralized and fair way, then all the current Instagram users would receive tokens from this new project which makes them owner of the service they actually use (and not the product). Then, they could switch in one click, take all their data with them and start on this new and fairer platform. Guys, this is HUGE!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PS: Watch out. In the coming weeks there will be a lot of similar projects &amp;quot;doing the same thing&amp;quot; but only trying to scam you out of your hard earned money.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON
