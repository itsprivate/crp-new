Market kept going down so I kept posting collateral as needed to keep the loan healthy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got an email saying that the loan was being called back because of &amp;quot;indirect exposure to a mixing service&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I appealed the decision because I bought the BTC back in May of 2020 and kept it on my Trezor the entire time. However, since I didn&amp;#39;t buy it on an exchange and the person before me mixed it (BISQ) I get absolutely screwed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In summary I took out a loan when BTC was 65,000, Cost me over $6000 in origination fees, paid two months of loan payments ($2500+), got liquidated at $37,000 a few MINUTES before a pump to $42,000 today because of &amp;quot;indirect mixing exposure&amp;quot; and now I lost more than half of my BTC holdings, have a huge tax bill, and was screwed out of a fortune.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DO NOT USE BLOCKFI LOANS. Worst experience I have ever had in Bitcoin&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Since everybody keeps saying &amp;quot;Dont take loans to buy crypto&amp;quot; I am adding this comment to the main post&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;My bank did not consider BTC as an asset. I took out the loan with the intention of showing the balance in my bank account so I can get the mortgage and was planning on paying off the loans to get my BTC back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Didnt work out......&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT 2: Most importantly the main problem for me was the P2P nature of the transaction. They literally do not allow you to buy your BTC from any private source that does not perform KYC. This is the biggest piece of fuckery of the entire situation that people need to pay very close attention to. I didnt, and it cost me 100s of thousands&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://blockfi.com/prohibited-uses/\"&gt;https://blockfi.com/prohibited-uses/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/skxpr7/blockfi_horrible_loan_experience_fortune_lost/","title":"Blockfi Horrible Loan Experience (FORTUNE Lost)","tags":["CryptoCurrency","reddit"],"date":"February 05, 2022","dateISO":"2022-02-05T11:30:45.000Z","datetime":"2022-02-05 11:30","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"skxpr7","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/skxpr7/blockfi_horrible_loan_experience_fortune_lost/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/skxpr7/blockfi_horrible_loan_experience_fortune_lost/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"CryptoCurrency","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency","author":"JmanFrom87","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/JmanFrom87","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"JmanFrom87","score":478,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ブロックフィの恐ろしいローン体験（FORTUNE Lost）","the_new_excerpt":"30万ドルのローンを組み、60万ドル相当のBTCを担保に入れた。市場\nを、必要に応じて担保に入れ、融資を健全化しました。\n\n\n\nその時、「間接的」であることを理由に融資を取り消すという電子メールを受け取りました。\nミキシングサービスへの暴露\n\n\n\n私はその決定を不服とした...。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"洛克菲勒可怕的贷款经历（《财富》杂志迷失了方向）","the_new_excerpt":"贷款30万，拿出价值60万的BTC作为抵押。市场\n市场一直在下跌，所以我不断地根据需要贴出抵押品，以保持贷款的健康。\n\n\n\n我收到一封电子邮件，说贷款被收回了，因为 \"间接暴露于一个混合服务\"。\n暴露在一个混合服务中\"\n\n\n\n我对这一决定提出上诉...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"洛克菲勒可怕的貸款經歷（《財富》雜誌迷失了方向）","the_new_excerpt":"貸款30萬，拿出價值60萬的BTC作爲抵押。市場\n市場一直在下跌，所以我不斷地根據需要貼出抵押品，以保持貸款的健康。\n\n\n\n我收到一封電子郵件，說貸款被收回了，因爲 \"間接暴露於一個混合服務\"。\n暴露在一個混合服務中\"\n\n\n\n我對這一決定提出上訴...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-reddit-placeholder-1","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/dankmemes/comments/kc0vb6/i_tried_my_best/","title":"I tried my best","date":"January 01, 1970","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"我尽力了","the_new_excerpt":"test","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我盡力了","the_new_excerpt":"test","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-sl2kun","excerpt":"I don't want to come off as a killjoy; I'm as hyped as anyone here.
