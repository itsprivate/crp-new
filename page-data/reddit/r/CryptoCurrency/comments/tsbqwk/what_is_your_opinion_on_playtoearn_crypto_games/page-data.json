These blockchain-based monetizations of the gaming experience are effectively play-to-earn crypto games. Players play to gain prizes rather than to win, which is what sets them apart from typical games. The ability to compensate players for their time and effort is, unsurprisingly, at the root of the quick rise in popularity of these play-to-earn games, often known as GameFi. Who wouldn&amp;#39;t want to make money while having a good time? The future of gaming is PlayToEarn. While playing games, users must earn NFTs or crypto tokens!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have been on crypto royale(a coin that may be obtained through blockchain-based gaming. Users can join a game by joining a battlefield, and the last person standing wins a little amount of money in the form of bitcoin.), &lt;a href=\"https://godsunchained.com/\"&gt;Gods Unchained&lt;/a&gt;(is a truly competitive trading card game based on the blockchain that rewards you for playing. Players must outsmart their opponents by constructing formidable decks and employing combat techniques.), &lt;a href=\"https://axieinfinity.com/\"&gt;Axie infinity&lt;/a&gt;(In the field of NFT gaming, Axie Infinity is the undisputed leader. NFTs represent in-game digital assets such as the Axie animals. As previously stated, these cryptographically unique tokens confer ownership and allow players to exchange axis for real money on the game&amp;#39;s marketplace.), &lt;a href=\"https://splinterlands.com/\"&gt;splinterlands&lt;/a&gt;(Winning battles is the most common way to acquire DEC. DEC is awarded to you according to your level, your opponent&amp;#39;s level, and your capture rate in each combat. As you win, your capture rate decreases, lowering your payout, but it progressively replenishes between wins) and &lt;a href=\"https://engntoken.com/\"&gt;ENGN&lt;/a&gt; which i have recently grown much interest on(When a typical game is played, it responds to the player&amp;#39;s inputs and creates reactions within the game world using the language it was written in and the game mechanics engine it was built on. The outputs are displayed either graphically or as achievements in some way whenever the player has won a round, mission, or finished a task. ENGN now kicks in. ENGN translates the user&amp;#39;s blockchain data into data that the game environment can interpret. ENGN identifies the game environment&amp;#39;s outputs and converts them to data that the blockchain can comprehend.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What are your opinions on this?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/tsbqwk/what_is_your_opinion_on_playtoearn_crypto_games/","title":"What is your opinion on play-to-earn crypto games?","tags":["CryptoCurrency","reddit"],"date":"March 30, 2022","dateISO":"2022-03-30T22:39:22.000Z","datetime":"2022-03-30 22:39","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"tsbqwk","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/tsbqwk/what_is_your_opinion_on_playtoearn_crypto_games/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/tsbqwk/what_is_your_opinion_on_playtoearn_crypto_games/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"CryptoCurrency","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency","author":"guiltlesshonesty_84","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/guiltlesshonesty_84","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"guiltlesshonesty_84","score":405,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"プレイ・トゥ・アーンの暗号ゲームについて、どのようにお考えですか？","the_new_excerpt":"従来のゲーム業界はGameFiによって破壊されつつある\nプロジェクトやプレイ・トゥ・アーンのゲームなど これらのブロックチェーンに基づくマネタイズは\nゲーム体験は、事実上、プレイ・トゥ・アーンの暗号ゲームです。プレイヤーは以下を目的としてプレイします。\nそのため、「勝つこと」よりも「賞品を得ること」を重視しているのが特徴です。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"你对玩赚的加密货币游戏有什么看法？","the_new_excerpt":"我们所知的传统游戏行业正在被GameFi\n项目和游戏赚钱的游戏所颠覆。这些基于区块链的货币化的\n这些基于区块链的货币化游戏体验实际上是玩到赚的加密货币游戏。玩家通过游戏来\n奖品，而不是为了赢钱，这也是它们与其他游戏不同的地方。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"你對玩賺的加密貨幣遊戲有什麼看法？","the_new_excerpt":"我們所知的傳統遊戲行業正在被GameFi\n項目和遊戲賺錢的遊戲所顛覆。這些基於區塊鏈的貨幣化的\n這些基於區塊鏈的貨幣化遊戲體驗實際上是玩到賺的加密貨幣遊戲。玩家通過遊戲來\n獎品，而不是爲了贏錢，這也是它們與其他遊戲不同的地方。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ts8mbp","excerpt":"Ethereum (ETH)\n[https://getblock.io/nodes/eth/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=promo]\nvolumes appeared to be converging with those in its larger peer Bitcoin BTC\n[https://getblock.io/nodes/btc/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=promo],\nrecent data showed.
