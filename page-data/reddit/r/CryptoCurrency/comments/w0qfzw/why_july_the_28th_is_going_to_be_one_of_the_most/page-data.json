So are we set for a few weeks of relief and maybe even reversal? Don&amp;#39;t be foolish te real test of Crypto is yet to come.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On July 28th the US will release its Q2 GDP estimate, just for your memory the last Q1 report is at - 1.7% after it was predicted to be +1.1% by the walls street. And IF we get this quarter in the red too, then the US will officially be on a recession according to textbook rules. So we just have to not be in the minus can&amp;#39;t be that hard right? For comparison the Atlanta FED had predicted a - 1.1% quarter a few days ago and now even updated that to a - 2.7% quarter. So a recession in the US is HIGHLY HIGHLY LIKELY and to be announced on July 28th.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This would be a historic event for Crypto to be in such a completly new environment it has never been in before and also for stock markets that&amp;#39;s a recession for the first time since 2008, baring the flash-recession in 2020. It will be interesting to see how crypto adopts to this historic situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/w0qfzw/why_july_the_28th_is_going_to_be_one_of_the_most/","title":"Why July the 28th is going to be one of the most important dates for Crypto.","tags":["CryptoCurrency","reddit"],"date":"July 17, 2022","dateISO":"2022-07-17T10:43:33.000Z","datetime":"2022-07-17 10:43","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"w0qfzw","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/w0qfzw/why_july_the_28th_is_going_to_be_one_of_the_most/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/w0qfzw/why_july_the_28th_is_going_to_be_one_of_the_most/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"CryptoCurrency","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency","author":"partymsl","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/partymsl","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"partymsl","score":308,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"7月28日がCryptoにとって最も重要な日のひとつになる理由。","the_new_excerpt":"今現在、すべてが順調に思え、高すぎるインフレデータを打ったが、我々は\n数日後、また合併騒動が勃発しそうです。\nまた、合併騒動が勃発していることも忘れてはならない。このまま数週間は安泰で、もしかしたら反転するかもしれません。\n反転するのでしょうか？しかし、そのようなことはありません。暗号の本当のテストはこれからです。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"为什么7月28日将是加密货币最重要的日期之一。","the_new_excerpt":"现在，一切似乎都很好，我们遇到了一个太高的通货膨胀数据，但我们是\n几天后，我们仍然在抽水，而且别忘了，合并的炒作似乎又开始了。\n炒作再次启动。那么，我们是否会有几周的缓解期，甚至可能是\n反转？别傻了，加密货币的真正考验还在后面。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"爲什麼7月28日將是加密貨幣最重要的日期之一。","the_new_excerpt":"現在，一切似乎都很好，我們遇到了一個太高的通貨膨脹數據，但我們是\n幾天後，我們仍然在抽水，而且別忘了，合併的炒作似乎又開始了。\n炒作再次啓動。那麼，我們是否會有幾周的緩解期，甚至可能是\n反轉？別傻了，加密貨幣的真正考驗還在後面。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-w0kg1e","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/w0kg1e/cryptopunk_4156_sells_at_loss_of_7m_despite/","title":"CryptoPunk 4156 Sells at Loss of $7M Despite Netting the Owner 190 ETH in Profit -
