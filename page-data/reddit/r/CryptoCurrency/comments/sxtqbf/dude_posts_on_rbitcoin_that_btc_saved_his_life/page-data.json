OP was on a little road trip with his family and when he wanted to get gas his card didn&amp;#39;t work. He called the bank and &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;they had froze my accounts due to &amp;quot;suspected fraudulent activity&amp;quot; and said there was nothing they could do for 24 hours&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sure, that&amp;#39;s how it works, this is a real story. You know, it&amp;#39;s just like that totally not just Hollywood trope but real thing that police have to wait 24 hours to look for a missing person. Okay, so in this real situation OPs life was threatened - stranded, probably in the US - how could one survive for 24 hours?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, fortunately OP found a solution:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I remembered I had some money in bitcoin. I was able to find a crypto atm (didn&amp;#39;t even know those existed) within a quarter mile that I walked to. At this atm, I was able to sell some of my bitcoin and withdraw cash from the atm, which I was then able to use to buy gas to get home. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Phew, he escaped death this time. Someone posted this story on this sub as well before, titling it &amp;quot;That’s why we need Crypto&amp;quot;. And that&amp;#39;s absolutely true! But just in case you ever get into such a life-threatening situation and don&amp;#39;t have crypto, I have some advice for you:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;don&amp;#39;t die, ideally. There is nothing dangerous about the situation, worst case is you&amp;#39;ll have to spend the night somewhere close-by and pay once your accounts get unfrozen (even though it&amp;#39;s reeeeally unlikely that your accounts, plural, all get frozen and that your wife, who is accompanying you, seemingly doesn&amp;#39;t have any)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;carry a bit of cash with you? I know, cash is not as obvious as crypto and many people don&amp;#39;t know you can exchange it for goods, but it actually works quite well, with instant, free transactions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To sum up: don&amp;#39;t make up incredibly stupid stories that try to show how useful crypto is, and then make up a situation that could much more easily be solved using cash. Yes, we all like crypto and hope it will have a lot of utility in the future, but we don&amp;#39;t have to pretend it&amp;#39;s more essential than it is in today&amp;#39;s world.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/sxtqbf/dude_posts_on_rbitcoin_that_btc_saved_his_life/","title":"Dude posts on r/bitcoin that BTC \"saved his life\" because he couldn't access his bank account when he was getting gas and sold some BTC to buy some.
