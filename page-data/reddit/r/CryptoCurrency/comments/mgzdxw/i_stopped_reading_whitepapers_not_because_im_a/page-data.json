Anyways, before anybody discredits me, I am studying Computer Science and have been able to land some nice internships, so yes, I admit that I&#39;m not an expert and there are many things I don&#39;t know, however I would consider myself someone that has been exposed to basic Computer Science concepts, and more advanced ones in Algorithms, Data Structures and Cryptography.</p>\n\n<p>With that out of the way, I just wanted to say that there are a lot of people here giving recommendations to new people (which is great) and there is this specific one that really irks me, &quot;Read the whitepaper&quot;. Why does it annoy me so much?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Well, for starters I highly doubt that people giving these recommendations even read the whitepapers themselves, I honestly believe that they say this in order to look like &quot;responsible investors&quot; or &quot;being in it for the tech&quot;, whatever their motives are, I believe that 99% are lying.</li>\n<li>For the tiny minority that actually reads the whitepapers, I don&#39;t mean to sound like an asshole, but I highly doubt you understand the important technical part of the whitepapers completely. I say this because I&#39;ve taken several high level CS courses in college and I struggle every time to grasp some concepts that describe how a certain project works and what makes it significant. I am certainly no guru, but I believe that I know more CS than the vast majority of people who are trying to get into crypto, and if someone like me can&#39;t understand what these whitepapers say, how exactly will a newcomer get any benefit from trying to read these documents?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You know, I remember I got into crypto right when I started college, and even now 3 years later, I prefer just watching a simplified video about a project than trying to read the whitepaper, which I know will be a waste of time. There is a reason why most projects upload a simplified version that explains how the project works, and that&#39;s so that newcomers can get an idea of what the project is. Odds are that the vast majority of people trying to buy a certain cryptocurrency will be people that just don&#39;t have the background required to understand whitepapers, so let&#39;s stop recommending them to read whitepapers and instead recommend them something different, like watching videos or reading simplified articles that explain what the cryptocurrency that they want to buy is.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mgzdxw/i_stopped_reading_whitepapers_not_because_im_a/","title":"I stopped reading whitepapers.
