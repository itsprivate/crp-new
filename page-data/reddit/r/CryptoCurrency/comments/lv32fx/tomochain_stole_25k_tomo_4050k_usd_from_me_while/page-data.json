You can verify this by checking my post history and seeing my blood work here: <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/Hematology/comments/hzzsv5/weekly_thread_do_you_have_a_personal_question/g28r3vm/?context=3\">https://old.reddit.com/r/Hematology/comments/hzzsv5/weekly_thread_do_you_have_a_personal_question/g28r3vm/?context=3</a></p>\n\n<p>I didn&#39;t mention this before because I shouldn&#39;t have to. I didn&#39;t want to turn this into a pity party and I refuse to beg for donations and let the community pay for something that shouldn&#39;t even be possible on a decentralized chain.</p>\n\n<p><strong>In Brief:</strong> I held ERC20 Tomo tokens in my wallet on the idex v1 contract pre-swap, like 3 years ago. Tomo then locked all the tokens and swapped over to their mainnet. However, only people that had their tokens in the idex v1 contract had to fill out an application with a deadline of December 2020 to get their tokens back. I did not now this and could not remember the password to my wallet. Liver failure greatly affects the memory. Tomo refuses to return the tokens that are verifiably linked to my wallet even after being informed of my health and promising to get into contact with me. They still have them and are voting on what to spend them on. </p>\n\n<p>Tomochain forums thread: <a href=\"https://forum.tomochain.com/t/what-to-do-with-stucked-idex-tomo-coins/1129/5\">https://forum.tomochain.com/t/what-to-do-with-stucked-idex-tomo-coins/1129/5</a></p>\n\n<p>Archive link in case they censor again: <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210301051738/https://forum.tomochain.com/t/what-to-do-with-stucked-idex-tomo-coins/1129/5\">https://web.archive.org/web/20210301051738/https://forum.tomochain.com/t/what-to-do-with-stucked-idex-tomo-coins/1129/5</a></p>\n\n<p>You can see in the above thread that the project leader actually responds in a amicable manner. However, no one contacted me. I waited 2 days, messaged him, the other mods he mentions that were supposed to contact me, and updated my post. ALL of them have been active on the forums after I contacted them and read receipts are built in to the forum functionality, so I know they&#39;ve read my messages. This tells me that I&#39;m never getting my coins back. Why they would risk their entire reputation on this is beyond me. If they were pure scammers, they never would have returned anyone&#39;s idex coins or extended the deadline to begin with. I suspect its because of the price appreciation. </p>\n\n<p><strong>I&#39;m asking the community to help me get visibility on this in anyway you can. If you have twitter followers, please tweet this thread. If you know someone that might be able to help, please ask. If you have any questions I will do my best to answer them as promptly as I can but my health is poor and unpredictable.</strong></p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p><strong>takeaways:</strong> </p>\n\n<p>-Tomochain is being extremely shady about stealing the coins of a dying person who needs them to fucking stay alive.</p>\n\n<p>-They have banned me from telegram and censored my posts on their forums</p>\n\n<p>-Tomochain is NOT decentralized. If it was, they wouldn&#39;t be able to do this.</p>\n\n<p>-If you hold tomochain tokens, they can take your coins too just like they did mine.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lv32fx/tomochain_stole_25k_tomo_4050k_usd_from_me_while/","title":"Tomochain stole 25k tomo (40-50k USD) from me while im dying of liver failure.
