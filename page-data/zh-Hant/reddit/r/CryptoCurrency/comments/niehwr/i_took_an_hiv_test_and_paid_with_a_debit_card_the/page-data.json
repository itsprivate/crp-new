You&#39;re suppose to get HIV check with your health check-up which is required for the work visa. However, most places don&#39;t actually check anything. They even have an option for &quot;health check for work permit&quot; which is significantly cheaper than a real check-up. The doctor takes your blood and shakes it around for 2 minutes and then signs a piece of paper.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I decided to go get a real check-up from an actual HIV/STD clinic because, for some reason, I actually want to know if I&#39;m carrying a deadly virus.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I pay with the card from my bank. This was a few weeks ago. My bank knows where I work and they know I&#39;m a teacher. I&#39;m not sure why someone was looking at my transactions, or maybe this kind of transaction gets flagged automatically for different professions. Anyway, the school asked me about the results from my test and if I could send them a copy, just to make sure of course.</p>\n\n<p>Luckily the results were negative so I don&#39;t actually have to hide anything but what the fuck.</p>\n\n<p>This is why we need decentralized currency and hopefully some more private options will become more readily available in the future.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/niehwr/i_took_an_hiv_test_and_paid_with_a_debit_card_the/","title":"I took an HIV test and paid with a debit card.
