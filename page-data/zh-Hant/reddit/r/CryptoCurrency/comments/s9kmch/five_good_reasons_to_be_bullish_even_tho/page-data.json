Months and months of unrealized profits, poof, gone. We can spend all day moping around, but it won&amp;#39;t get us anywhere. Nothing has changed our investment thesis: crypto will improve our world, so in the long run, we&amp;#39;ll be rewarded.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel like chasing the gloomy sub mood, so here are five reasons to stay bullish for the long term.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1-Several hundreds millions of people hold &amp;amp; use crypto worldwide&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s hard to get an accurate estimate, but the best source I could find states that there is &lt;a href=\"https://triple-a.io/crypto-ownership/\"&gt;at least 300 million people holding crypto in the world&lt;/a&gt;. We definitely got mainstream last year, and the sheer amount of users makes it unlikely everything will go to zero anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2-Energy consumption of crypto will go down a lot, very soon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This week, US Congress is holding hearings about the energy consumption of cryptocurrencies. People are concerned about this, but here&amp;#39;s the thing : the second biggest coin out there by market cap, ETH, will switch off proof-of-work forever &lt;a href=\"https://ethblogging.wordpress.com/2021/12/24/eth-merge-eth-2-0-upgrade-will-be-renamed-to-bellatrix-hard-fork-eth-to-the-stars-and-beyond/\"&gt;in six months&lt;/a&gt;. This will cut down it&amp;#39;s energy consumption by about 99% - and the same goes for every ERC-20 tokens and every ERC-721 NFTs out there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3-Usecases are becoming more and more apparent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unbanked people in Argentina are using the Binance Smart Chain to accept payments. Major credit cards companies such as Visa and MasterCard are launching crypto products. Web3 social media is rising fast - same for P2E blockchain-based games. ENS domains are becoming a thing. The list goes on and on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2-Institutions are getting onboard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While it may take a while, pension funds, hedge funds and state-sponsored sovereign funds are getting interested in crypto. &lt;a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/lawrencewintermeyer/2021/08/12/institutional-money-is-pouring-into-the-crypto-market-and-its-only-going-to-grow/?sh=4b3f69114598\"&gt;About 7 out of 10 institutional investors&lt;/a&gt; recently surveyed by Forbes planned to buy and hold crypto. Medium-term, this will make our assets less volatile, with blue-chips such as ETH and BTC beeing seen as &amp;quot;internet bonds&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1-The most brillant minds are getting into crypto&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The crypto job market is in a frenzy. Developers are leaving web giants to go work for CEXs, L2 solutions, fintechs, etc. An Ethereum developer can get $300k/year nowadays. Cryptography research is going very well, and concepts such as zero-knowledge proof are already being used in protocols. For those &amp;quot;in it for the tech&amp;quot;, the future looks bright.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We will make it, my friends!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/s9kmch/five_good_reasons_to_be_bullish_even_tho/","title":"Five good reasons to be bullish even tho everything's crashing right now","tags":["CryptoCurrency","reddit"],"date":"January 22, 2022","dateISO":"2022-01-22T02:41:41.000Z","datetime":"2022-01-22 02:41","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"s9kmch","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/s9kmch/five_good_reasons_to_be_bullish_even_tho/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/s9kmch/five_good_reasons_to_be_bullish_even_tho/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"CryptoCurrency","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency","author":"busterrulezzz","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/busterrulezzz","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"busterrulezzz","score":301,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"今、あらゆるものが暴落しているが、強気になるべき5つの理由","the_new_excerpt":"聞けよ、聞けよ、親愛なる友よ。\n\n今日は痛い、嘘じゃない。何ヶ月もの含み益が、パァーッと。\nを消した。一日中ゴロゴロしていても埒があかない。何も\n暗号は私たちの世界を向上させるので、長期的には\nその結果、私たちは報われるでしょう。\n\nI...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"尽管现在一切都在崩溃，但有五个看涨的好理由","the_new_excerpt":"听着，听着，我亲爱的朋友们。\n\n今天很痛，我不会撒谎。几个月来未实现的利润，噗的一声。\n消失了。我们可以整天闷闷不乐，但这对我们没有任何好处。没有什么\n我们的投资理论没有改变：加密货币将改善我们的世界，所以从长远来看\n我们会得到回报的。\n\nI...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"儘管現在一切都在崩潰，但有五個看漲的好理由","the_new_excerpt":"聽着，聽着，我親愛的朋友們。\n\n今天很痛，我不會撒謊。幾個月來未實現的利潤，噗的一聲。\n消失了。我們可以整天悶悶不樂，但這對我們沒有任何好處。沒有什麼\n我們的投資理論沒有改變：加密貨幣將改善我們的世界，所以從長遠來看\n我們會得到回報的。\n\nI...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-reddit-placeholder-1","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/dankmemes/comments/kc0vb6/i_tried_my_best/","title":"I tried my best","date":"January 01, 1970","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"我尽力了","the_new_excerpt":"test","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我盡力了","the_new_excerpt":"test","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-s9mwbo","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/Bitcoin/comments/s9mwbo/el_salvador_buys_the_dip_again_they_just_just/","title":"El Salvador buys the dip again!
