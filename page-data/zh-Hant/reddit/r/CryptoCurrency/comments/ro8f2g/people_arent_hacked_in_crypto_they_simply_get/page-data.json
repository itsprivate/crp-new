All horrible stories about people losing their crypto have one thing in common: someome was irresponsible and that is why they lost their crypto.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To to simply explain difference:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Imagine having a home - high fence, anti-theft doors, video cameras, alam and even a guard. Inside home you have  huge safe with all your money. Generally speaking \nit is pretty good security. Burglars would need to put a lot of effort, have whole team, top equipment and guns to break in. They would also get 20 or 30 years in prison if were catched on armed burglary, and your insurance would cover all costs anyway if they would run away. Also chance police will catch them later is huge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now imagine you open a gate, open your doors, turn off video cameras and alarm and give guard day off. You also open your safe. Now even a kid could come in and stole everything. Cause you ignored all security and basicslly invited people to stole everything. Totally irresponsible thing to do and in most countries not even treated as a burglary or robbery. Yeah you heard it well, if you leave open doors it can&amp;#39;t be even treated as breaking in. Just a simple theft, not different than taking something from  not fenced lawn. But it have severe consequenses. It is not armed burglary with use of force &amp;amp; specialistic equipment, just a theft, so max few years of prison for anyone responsible. In case when criminal run away your insurance will cover nothing, cause you basically invited him and broke terms of contract with insurance company. Police also have small chance to catch him, almost no traces are left.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First of those situations is hacking - using brutal force to break your seed phrases or passwords. Most often impossible. Seed phrase is impossible to break with current technology. Only thing that can be hacked in crypto are you e-mails or exchange. But in that case top exchanges ususally are insured so you will get everything back. Second of those situations is a scam. Much more dangerous, cause you invited someone to stole your crypto. How? You could write your seed phrase on some shady site, send it to some scammer or install and give access to your wallet/ account to some malicious app or program. No security will be enough if you will not use it and give someone access to your coins.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tl;dr:  As long as you will be responsible and careful and never let anyone scam you  your coins will be totally safe if you keep them in a wallet. Hack are impossible with modern technology. Your wallet is not less secure than  White House or Fort Knox.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ro8f2g/people_arent_hacked_in_crypto_they_simply_get/","title":"People aren't hacked in crypto.
