Yes, it has to go up by 3 million %... </p>\n\n<p>To go to even 10c, it has to go up by 362,884%</p>\n\n<p>Apparently, there are 394,796,000,000,000 SHIBs in circulation. </p>\n\n<p>Even at 10c, the market cap of SHIB alone will be over $39 Trillion. </p>\n\n<p>To be specific, a market cap of Thirty-Nine Trillion, Four Hundred Seventy-Nine Billion Six Hundred Million dollars</p>\n\n<p>Today, the entire crypto market cap is around $2.3 Trillion. So even at 10c, SHIB will be worth 20x today&#39;s crypto market cap. </p>\n\n<p>Firstly, this is not happening anytime soon. </p>\n\n<p>Secondly, this is not happening anytime in the future either.</p>\n\n<p>There is a higher probability of SHIB going to zero over it going to $1 or even 10c. </p>\n\n<p>Hundreds of shitcoins bust onto the scene during a crypto boom cycle, only to disappear during the bust. </p>\n\n<p>SHIB is a token that has no real value, apart from exploiting amateur investors and unit bias and traders riding it for quick gains. Almost everyone is in SHIB purely for profit. Many want over night riches and plan to hold till $1, which they believe will come soon.. many others are riding it got quick gains, and there is nothing wrong in that. Many shitcoins can give quick gains. But for them to claim there is something innovative or anything resembling new technology in SHIB is just delusional. </p>\n\n<p>The whole project is quite an exquisite combination of several pyramid scheme elements, and is quite well done. The devs have really delivered on their promise of making themselves rich.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/q5gdtj/if_shib_has_to_go_to_even_10_cents_it_will/","title":"If SHIB has to go to even 10 cents, it will multiply the entire crypto market cap by 20x.
