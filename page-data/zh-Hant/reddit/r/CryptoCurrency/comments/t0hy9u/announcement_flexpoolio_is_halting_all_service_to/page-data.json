The world is again faced with war, which could signal the next and  possibly final war. This may be the biggest war since WW2, bigger than  any of us, and goes beyond politics or nationality. This is a war at a  time of peace when we are busy dealing with and recovering from the  COVID-19 crisis. People are dying, and the world is guessing whether the  West will join in or watch Ukraine fall to Putin&amp;#39;s ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We  generally do not get involved in politics despite our personal views as  a company. However, this is greater than politics, greater than anyone.  This is a war that may end the world. It certainly is ending the lives  of many innocent people in Eastern Europe. While there is little we can  do, it would be wrong to profit off of it or fund it indirectly. We are  canceling service to all Russian IPs and paying out outstanding  balances.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We apologize to our  Russian miners; many of you do not support the war. However, it is you  who are supporting your nation. Without the people, Russia cannot  operate. It is only through reducing the economic power of its people  that we have a chance of affecting this war. We thank you for your  loyalty, and I hope you understand that we do not make this decision  lightly. Should this situation be resolved peacefully, we will happily  welcome back all Russian miners and use our personal funds to make it up  to you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you are in Ukraine and  reading this now, know that the world is with you.  We can&amp;#39;t change the  situation ourselves. We call on other companies and people around the  world to join us and make a difference together. This isn&amp;#39;t about  politics; this is about preventing the end of the world and saving  lives. Companies and people need to put the planet over profits in the  modern era. Ukraine has four nuclear power plants. Even ignoring the  chance of WW3, there is a chance of another Chernobyl should one of the  plants be endangered. The Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan happened  despite the plant having been forewarned so that they were shut down and  built to withstand an earthquake. Everyone in Europe, Russia, and the  Middle East are in danger of nuclear fallout should the worst happen.  Notice that the world will only end not because people do something but  because people know yet choose to do nothing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON
