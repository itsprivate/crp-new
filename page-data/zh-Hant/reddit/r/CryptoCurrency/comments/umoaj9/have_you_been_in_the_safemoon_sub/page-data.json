I can’t believe how many people are, lack of a better word, brainwashed. I feel like it has been proven that the developers are engaging in shady practices and not ethical. I am thinking they will take that money and run at some point. Why do you think people are so adamant that it’s a legitimate project? The “CEO” reeks of charlatan. Also, I believe they incorporated a 90% claim tax or something like that to where it’s hard to take money out (not sure if that’s accurate). I am not a skeptical person but my God I just don’t get it. I truly feel bad for the investors because from the outside it seems crazy that someone would fall for some of the explanations heard from the Safemoon team regarding certain accusations. Anyway,  was curious to hear everyone’s thoughts. I’m obviously not an investor in the project and just trying to understand peoples mentality when it comes to projects like this. Appreciate some insight. Fascinating stuff. Cheers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: first of all I want to say that I appreciate all of the comments. I have learned several things so far. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt; I am wrong about the 90% claim tax and I guess it is 100% transfer tax which seems much better. (Please someone clean me up on this if I’m still wrong)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt; I am apparently a karma whore. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The Safemoon army is a passionate bunch. I can appreciate that. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;People that post about Safemoon just want the moons. I was not aware of this. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;There are people that have invested who understood that it was a longshot and invested only what they were willing to lose or made a little money early and got out. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Lots of bots in the Safemoon subreddit.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/umoaj9/have_you_been_in_the_safemoon_sub/","title":"Have you been in the Safemoon sub?","tags":["CryptoCurrency","reddit"],"date":"May 11, 2022","dateISO":"2022-05-11T01:19:04.000Z","datetime":"2022-05-11 01:19","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"umoaj9","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/umoaj9/have_you_been_in_the_safemoon_sub/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/umoaj9/have_you_been_in_the_safemoon_sub/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"CryptoCurrency","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency","author":"markalanray00","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/markalanray00","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"markalanray00","score":348,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"セーフムーンの潜水艦に乗ったことがありますか？","the_new_excerpt":"ワイルドですね。こんなに多くの人が、言葉は悪いですが、\n洗脳されている。開発者がいかがわしい行為をしていることが証明されたような気がする。\n倫理的に問題があることが証明されたような気がする。彼らはいずれ、そのお金を持って逃げ出すと思う。\nと思っています。なんでみんなそんなに固執するんだろう・・・。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"你去过Safemoon潜艇吗？","the_new_excerpt":"这很疯狂。我无法相信有多少人，缺乏一个更好的词。\n被洗脑了。我觉得它已经被证明，开发商在从事\n阴暗的做法和不道德的行为。我在想，他们会拿着钱跑路的\n在某些时候。你认为为什么人们如此坚持认为这是一个...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"你去過Safemoon潛艇嗎？","the_new_excerpt":"這很瘋狂。我無法相信有多少人，缺乏一個更好的詞。\n被洗腦了。我覺得它已經被證明，開發商在從事\n陰暗的做法和不道德的行爲。我在想，他們會拿着錢跑路的\n在某些時候。你認爲爲什麼人們如此堅持認爲這是一個...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-umujej","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/Bitcoin/comments/umujej/not_your_keys_not_your_coins_page_83_of_the/","title":"Not your keys, not your coins.
