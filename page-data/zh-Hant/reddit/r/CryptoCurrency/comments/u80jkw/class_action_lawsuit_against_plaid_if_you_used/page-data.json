Coinbase, Gemini, and Public are just three exchanges I use, and ALL are affected by this (others include Robinhood and Venmo). When you initially make an account with one of these exchanges, they use the third-party company Plaid to connect to your bank account and verify.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, Plaid was accessing everyone&amp;#39;s bank info, including transactions, &amp;quot;anonymizing&amp;quot; the data, and selling it. This is what the class action lawsuit is about. Anyone who connected their bank to an exchange or other service using Plaid before November 2021 should file a claim right now, your personal data was illegally sold. Again, you might not even remember it, you did not have to make an account with Plaid, this is just the 20 second process of using them to connect your bank. Over 5,000 apps used Plaid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is my first time involving myself with a class action lawsuit, it&amp;#39;s actually very easy. If you cannot remember or are unsure what apps used Plaid, first go to &lt;a href=\"https://my.plaid.com/\"&gt;https://my.plaid.com/&lt;/a&gt; and make an account with Plaid. When you make an account, it will tell you what connections associated with your phone number are on file. Click to view that list of connected apps that you&amp;#39;ve used Plaid with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next, go to the settlement website: &lt;a href=\"https://plaidsettlement.com/submit-claim.php\"&gt;https://plaidsettlement.com/submit-claim.php&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fill out the form, it takes just a minute. On section two, fill out the boxes using information you got from Plaid: Bank account connected/app used (coinbase, gemini, etc)/ and approximate date of connection. Plaid will not give you an exact date, but your best guess should be good enough, anything prior to November of 2021 is valid. At the end, you can select a method to receive your settlement payout. Paypal and direct deposit into your bank are accepted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Exact payout amounts and dates are not known, but Plaid has had to establish a settlement fund of $58 million to be divided among everyone. I can imagine that the more connections you had, the more you will get.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The final court hearing appears to be set for May 12th. Again, make sure you file your claim before April 28th of THIS MONTH. Get your money from these scummy fucks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;E: Since there are a lot of comments asking, this is unfortunately for US citizens only, as it is being settled in a US court. A class action suit would need to be filed in your respective countries for action there.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/u80jkw/class_action_lawsuit_against_plaid_if_you_used/","title":"Class action lawsuit against Plaid: if you used crypto exchanges such as Coinbase or Gemini last year, Plaid stored and sold your bank info","tags":["CryptoCurrency","reddit"],"date":"April 20, 2022","dateISO":"2022-04-20T21:34:21.000Z","datetime":"2022-04-20 21:34","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"u80jkw","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/u80jkw/class_action_lawsuit_against_plaid_if_you_used/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/u80jkw/class_action_lawsuit_against_plaid_if_you_used/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"CryptoCurrency","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency","author":"Skip143091","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Skip143091","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Skip143091","score":385,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Plaidに対する集団訴訟：昨年CoinbaseやGeminiなどの暗号取引所を利用した場合、Plaidはあなたの銀行情報を保存し販売した。","the_new_excerpt":"もしかしたら、ご存じない方もいらっしゃるかもしれませんので、一応お知らせしておきますと\nメールを受け取っていないか、私のようにスパムとして無視しているかもしれません。Coinbase、Gemini、そして\nPublicは私が使っている3つの取引所ですが、すべてこの影響を受けています（他にはRobinhoodやVenmoなど\nRobinhoodやVenmoも含まれます）。最初にアカウントを作るとき...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"对Plaid的集体诉讼：如果你去年使用Coinbase或Gemini等加密货币交易所，Plaid储存并出售了你的银行信息","the_new_excerpt":"只是给那些可能不知道的人提个醒，也许你没有收到过\n收到这些邮件，或者像我一样把它们当作垃圾邮件忽略掉。Coinbase, Gemini, 和\nPublic是我使用的三个交易所，所有这些交易所都受到影响（其他交易所包括\n包括Robinhood和Venmo）。当你最初创建一个账户时...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"對Plaid的集體訴訟：如果你去年使用Coinbase或Gemini等加密貨幣交易所，Plaid儲存並出售了你的銀行信息","the_new_excerpt":"只是給那些可能不知道的人提個醒，也許你沒有收到過\n收到這些郵件，或者像我一樣把它們當作垃圾郵件忽略掉。Coinbase, Gemini, 和\nPublic是我使用的三個交易所，所有這些交易所都受到影響（其他交易所包括\n包括Robinhood和Venmo）。當你最初創建一個賬戶時...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-u7z6b2","excerpt":"Posted by the same guy who made the shill list yesterday: zachxbt on Twitter\n\n\nYOUTUBER LIST\n\nThis list doesn't include our beloved Bitboy.
