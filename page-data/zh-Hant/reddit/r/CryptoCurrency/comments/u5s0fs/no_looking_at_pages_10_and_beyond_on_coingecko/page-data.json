Of course everyone wants a time machine so they can buy Bitcoin back in 2009/2010/2011, but what’s the point if being early if you would not have held until 2021/2022? Remember pizza guy?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A lot of people who were early sold early too. When Bitcoin was $1k or even $100 for example. But I don’t blame them, because profit = profit. Anyway, being early is good but &lt;strong&gt;certainly&lt;/strong&gt; not “everything”.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;so it baffles me that people buy top 50 coins and expect to get rich. These generally have 2-3x potential at best in any reasonable investor timeframe, while lowcaps have 100-500x potential.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Incorrect. If FTM (#46 on Coingecko) had the marketcap of DOGE (#12 on Coingecko), the upside would be 544%. Even if ATOM (#23 on Coingecko) had the marketcap of ADA (#8 on Coingecko), the upside would be 330%. And let’s not forget that the crypto market is relatively new: Bitcoin exists for only 13 years. Cryptocurrency in general has a lot of grow potential.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, OP has a narrow definition of “reasonable investor timeframe”. What does that even mean? People expecting quick gains, chasing pumps or waiting for their coin to x100 often get burned. Besides, lowcaps may have 100-500x potential, but are very volatile and even though the price may go up fast… it can dump real fast too. High/mid marketcaps are a more stable and safer choice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But it&amp;#39;s so risky!&amp;quot; you may object. Well, here&amp;#39;s the thing: that risk can be managed by looking at some key factors before you invest in a project:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;OP then continues by writing down some rules. These are good guidelines to pick a solid project with a good use case, and avoid things like a pump and dump.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If your inquiry survived all 7 points, congratulations! You&amp;#39;re &lt;em&gt;early&lt;/em&gt; in a project that has a good chance of becoming very valuable.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Exactly. “A good chance.” We only hear of success stories and generally don’t hear about the times people who failed to pick a project that did a x100.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To finish this rant, I would like to get rid of the assumption that a good project or a doxxed team does not automatically mean that the price is going to x100. There are a LOT of very good and solid (low marketcap) projects that never got in the top marketcap rankings for years.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/u5s0fs/no_looking_at_pages_10_and_beyond_on_coingecko/","title":"No. Looking at pages 10 and beyond on Coingecko and tick the “7 key factors” boxes will NOT guarantee wealth.","tags":["CryptoCurrency","reddit"],"date":"April 17, 2022","dateISO":"2022-04-17T23:44:09.000Z","datetime":"2022-04-17 23:44","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"u5s0fs","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/u5s0fs/no_looking_at_pages_10_and_beyond_on_coingecko/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/u5s0fs/no_looking_at_pages_10_and_beyond_on_coingecko/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"CryptoCurrency","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency","author":"pepperonimilkjuice5","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/pepperonimilkjuice5","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"pepperonimilkjuice5","score":351,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Coingeckoの10ページ以降を見て、「7つの重要な要素」のボックスにチェックを入れても、富は保証されません。","the_new_excerpt":"この記事は、投稿への返信です。\n[https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/u5je3f/how_i_accumulated_my_wealth_by_looking_at_pages/]\nトップページの「10ページ以降を見て財産を蓄えた方法」と題するページで\nCoingeckoのその先』です。\n\nまず最初に、彼の話は逸話であり、...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"不，查看Coingecko的第10页及以后的内容，并在 \"7个关键因素 \"的方框内打勾，并不能保证财富。","the_new_excerpt":"这是对该帖子的回应\n[https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/u5je3f/how_i_accumulated_my_wealth_by_looking_at_pages/]\n标题为 \"我是如何通过看第10页和第10页积累财富的 \"的帖子的回应。\n以上的帖子。\n\n让我先说一下，他的故事是传闻，而不是...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"不，查看Coingecko的第10頁及以後的內容，並在 \"7個關鍵因素 \"的方框內打勾，並不能保證財富。","the_new_excerpt":"這是對該帖子的回應\n[https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/u5je3f/how_i_accumulated_my_wealth_by_looking_at_pages/]\n標題爲 \"我是如何通過看第10頁和第10頁積累財富的 \"的帖子的回應。\n以上的帖子。\n\n讓我先說一下，他的故事是傳聞，而不是...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-u5ae4e","excerpt":"https://preview.redd.it/jxm3z69y9zt81.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e0bc2c79f46ea648b2ef41f67ab2400ee365e44","slug":"/reddit/r/Bitcoin/comments/u5ae4e/rich_dad_poor_dad_author_robert_kiyosaki_says/","title":"Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki says that hyperinflation and depression are here, advising investors to buy gold, silver, and #bitcoin. #cryptocurrency #crypto","date":"April 17, 2022","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"金持ち父さん貧乏父さん」の著者ロバート・キヨサキ氏は、ハイパーインフレと恐慌が到来していると述べ、投資家に金、銀、#ビットコインを買うよう助言しています。#暗号通貨 #クリプト","the_new_excerpt":"https://preview.redd.it/jxm3z69y9zt81.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e0bc2c79f46ea648b2ef41f67ab2400ee365e44","locale":"ja"},{"title":"富爸爸穷爸爸》作者罗伯特-清崎说，恶性通货膨胀和萧条已经到来，建议投资者购买黄金、白银和#比特币。#cryptocurrency #crypto","the_new_excerpt":"https://preview.redd.it/jxm3z69y9zt81.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e0bc2c79f46ea648b2ef41f67ab2400ee365e44","locale":"zh"},{"title":"富爸爸窮爸爸》作者羅伯特-清崎說，惡性通貨膨脹和蕭條已經到來，建議投資者購買黃金、白銀和#比特幣。#cryptocurrency #crypto","the_new_excerpt":"https://preview.redd.it/jxm3z69y9zt81.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e0bc2c79f46ea648b2ef41f67ab2400ee365e44","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-u5xp4o","excerpt":"This post\n[https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/u5je3f/how_i_accumulated_my_wealth_by_looking_at_pages/]\nis at the top of the sub right now.
