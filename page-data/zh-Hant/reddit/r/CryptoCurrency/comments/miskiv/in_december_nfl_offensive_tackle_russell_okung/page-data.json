Here’s some quotes from the article. Sauce at the bottom. </p>\n\n<p>“If we are looking at where Bitcoin is at now, Okung could be considered one of the highest salaried NFL players at this moment.”</p>\n\n<p>“For instance, when BTC hit $44k, the half of his contract that is paid in BTC climbed to $10.59 million, at $56k+ his half turned into more than his entire quoted salary. As far as 2020 NFL salary stats are concerned, Okung has entered the top five position. However, the NFL has recently decided to cap the league’s salaries at $180 million and a ball player’s contract could change in 2021. Because the Carolina Panthers’ offensive tackle (OT) gets half of his salary in BTC, many proponents think of him as the highest-paid player in the NFL and not just ahead of the highest-paid OTs.”</p>\n\n<p>“Money is more than currency; it’s power,” said Okung in a statement. “The way money is handled from creation to dissemination is part of that power. Getting paid in bitcoin is the first step of opting out of the corrupt, manipulated economy we all inhabit.”</p>\n\n<p>“Okung went further into that statement adding: ‘When we are all paid in bitcoin, no one can tell us what to do with the value we create … In a post-fiat world, you won’t have to worry about your labor and time being stolen.” </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nbcsports.com/northwest/seahawks/former-seattle-seahawk-russell-okung-puts-half-salary-bitcoin-considered-highest\">Sauce</a></p>\n\n<p>Now that the NBA has a NFT and a blockchain advisory committee, I wanted to remind everyone that this happened. These are two very big organizations that are getting on board with crypto. We’re getting closer to mass adoption!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/miskiv/in_december_nfl_offensive_tackle_russell_okung/","title":"In December NFL offensive tackle, Russell Okung, asked for half of his salary in BTC.
