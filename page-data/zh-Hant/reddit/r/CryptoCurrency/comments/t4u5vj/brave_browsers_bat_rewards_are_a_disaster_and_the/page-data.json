Users can earn BAT by viewing these ads, and Brave keeps a cut (30%) to run their operations. This process has been steadily regressing, with more and more issues this month and seems to be capitulating.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://community.brave.com/c/brave-rewards/71\"&gt;https://community.brave.com/c/brave-rewards/71&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Their community forum is full of people experiencing Brave&amp;#39;s terrible payout system. Basically, Brave tells you you&amp;#39;ll get paid the 5-7th, but that isn&amp;#39;t happening. Your rewards seem to disappear, and then you hope one day you get paid. The Brave Team seems to expect their millions of users to individually PM them to get it resolved on a wallet-by wallet basis, and as you can imagine, they aren&amp;#39;t able to keep up. Now they&amp;#39;re rolling people&amp;#39;s rewards over to the next month, essentially just holding people&amp;#39;s money until they look into it more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.bravebat.info/brave_initiated_bat_purchase\"&gt;https://www.bravebat.info/brave_initiated_bat_purchase&lt;/a&gt;\nBrave touts 54 million active monthly users, but has failed to convert those numbers into revenue. The link above shows that for 54MM users, they&amp;#39;ve never done more than $3MM in monthly BAT sales, which they only keep 30% of. This is pennies a month per user, and means that Brave is massively cash flow negative, as they claim hundreds of employees. They have completely failed to effectively monetize their massive user base, and now we&amp;#39;re seeing they&amp;#39;re completely in over their head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you head over to &lt;a href=\"/r/batproject\"&gt;r/batproject&lt;/a&gt;, you&amp;#39;ll see that the Brave Team has stopped engaging their users, unless they have a very canned response. Their &amp;quot;Director of Engagement&amp;quot; posts very rarely, and they refuse to respond to questions of users. The red flags are adding up, and my guess is that Brave is failing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Investing in BAT I&amp;#39;m realizing is like investing in a private company, and is actually a regressive way to invest. They don&amp;#39;t disclose their runrate, revenue, all revenue sources, executive compensation and many other key metrics that you can see at any publicly traded company. However, Brave touts &amp;quot;transparency&amp;quot; every chance they get, while being about as transparent as milk when it comes to any issues with the payouts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most damming metric is the 0 growth in ad campaigns in the US. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.bravebat.info/brave_ads_campaigns?country=United%20States\"&gt;https://www.bravebat.info/brave_ads_campaigns?country=United%20States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shows 2 years of flat US ad campaigns, so US advertisers don&amp;#39;t want this. plenty of big names have come through, and very few of run repeat campaigns. If you use the browser, the ads you&amp;#39;ll get now are from very low quality companies, similar to when the browser first started.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;#39;s clear that BAT is failing. Most people on here get maybe a couple of quarters a month, after being told how valuable their data is. Most people think the rewards are a complete joke on here, and I guess they are, and the team&amp;#39;s response is certainly telling of a team in complete disarray. The idea of privacy browser that compensates you for your ad viewing is brilliant, but this team&amp;#39;s execution of that concept ain&amp;#39;t it. It&amp;#39;s been years, they won&amp;#39;t talk about what&amp;#39;s going on, and it&amp;#39;s getting worse. Take a look through that first link, it&amp;#39;s not good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These issues have gotten worse over the years, and clearly Brave isn&amp;#39;t going to be &amp;quot;transparent&amp;quot; about the problem. I would advise any investors to assume that if the team won&amp;#39;t answer their questions, it&amp;#39;s because the answer is really bad. The Brave Team won&amp;#39;t answer these questions on &lt;a href=\"/r/batproject\"&gt;r/batproject&lt;/a&gt; - go take a look, they&amp;#39;ve been asked for years, the team will engage and then ghost any question they don&amp;#39;t like.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/t4u5vj/brave_browsers_bat_rewards_are_a_disaster_and_the/","title":"Brave Browser's BAT Rewards are a Disaster, and the Team is Failing to Address What's Going On, and is Non-Responsive on r/BATPROJECT","tags":["CryptoCurrency","reddit"],"date":"March 02, 2022","dateISO":"2022-03-02T16:35:25.000Z","datetime":"2022-03-02 16:35","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"t4u5vj","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/t4u5vj/brave_browsers_bat_rewards_are_a_disaster_and_the/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/t4u5vj/brave_browsers_bat_rewards_are_a_disaster_and_the/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"CryptoCurrency","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency","author":"milehigh89","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/milehigh89","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"milehigh89","score":319,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Brave BrowserのBAT報酬は大失敗、チームは何が起きているのかに対処できず、無反応 on r/BATPROJECT","the_new_excerpt":"広告主はブレイブにお金を払ってBATを購入し、ブラウザー上で広告キャンペーンを展開します。ユーザーは\n広告を見ることでBATを獲得し、Braveはその30％を運営費として徴収します。\nの運用を開始しました。このプロセスは着実に後退しており、問題が多くなっています\n今月は、どうやら...。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"勇敢的浏览器的BAT奖励是一场灾难，团队未能解决发生的问题，并且在r/BATPROJECT上没有反应。","the_new_excerpt":"广告商向Brave支付购买BAT的费用，以便在浏览器上开展广告活动。用户可以\n用户可以通过观看这些广告来赚取BAT，而Brave则保留一部分（30%）来运行他们的\n运营。这个过程一直在稳步退步，这个月的问题越来越多。\n这个月，似乎是...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"勇敢的瀏覽器的BAT獎勵是一場災難，團隊未能解決發生的問題，並且在r/BATPROJECT上沒有反應。","the_new_excerpt":"廣告商向Brave支付購買BAT的費用，以便在瀏覽器上開展廣告活動。用戶可以\n用戶可以通過觀看這些廣告來賺取BAT，而Brave則保留一部分（30%）來運行他們的\n運營。這個過程一直在穩步退步，這個月的問題越來越多。\n這個月，似乎是...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-t4yy7f","excerpt":"I’ve been seeing a lot of people post about adding BTC and ETH to their\nportfolio and asking questions how they should split up their portfolio.
