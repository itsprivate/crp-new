Let me illustrate this, using some of my own life experiences as examples. Here we go:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Me and 2 friends discover something called bitcoin when it was $40 a pop and litecoin at $2. Poor as church mice we collect all our money and invest it into computers to mine bitcoin. B&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;y our calculations we could make roughly $2000 a month in total. We ended up doing this for well over a year and during this time people laughed at us and we were literally the joke of our university. A year later due to some personal circumstances and letting haters get to my head I sold all my bitcoin and litecoin (±600) for about $100K in total which was a small fortune as a student.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- I use that money to start a business. I had mediocre success and was basically at square one again a couple years later after taxes and other bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- I go deep into stocks and crypto again, this time I am thinking I have learned from my mistake of selling too early. So now I have invested about $50K in crypto and all is going wonderful until the bear market of 2017 all until 2019 hits me. My portfolio went from $150K to less than $30K during that time and after the gubment raped my ass with taxes I was again, back at square one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Meanwhile end of 2019 an acquaintance of mine with the mental faculties of a goddamn baboon had gotten a small inheritance a couple years before that and bought a house. Due to an inflated market he had cashed out selling his house in 2019 and had a couple hundred thousand lying around. He puts it into crypto, and about a year later he cashes out most and is now a multimillionaire.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- In 2020 I had again, after slaving away, a bit of cash invested in the markets again. This time I am sure that I need to take profit again sooner. I now do insane due diligence on stocks and crypto and my portfolio goes from $20K to $200K. I take some profit and think all is well, then november comes around and it is basically down 75% from that. And I had ZERO clown crypto or stocks at this time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- I did however, just for shits and giggles, bought $2K worth of shiba before it went nuclear. My reasoning was simple; people are so fucking stupid that next to doge I am sure they will buy another fucking dog coin. That turned out to be true and that $2K turned into $18K. I cashed out all of it. If I had held it, it would have been worth $800K.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;WHY am I sharing this? The only difference in the people making it and not making it is often LUCK. and NOTHING more. Holding shit for 10 years is a great strategy, until it isn&amp;#39;t. Cashing out is a great strategy, until you realize you were WAY too early. Playing it safe and diversifying is great, until life happens and you need to cash out for whatever reason. Do not be fooled; most of the people who got rich in crypto got lucky. Nothing more. That especially goes for influencers in this space.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;May luck be on your side.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ss5f5u/the_truth_about_getting_rich_in_crypto/","title":"The truth about getting rich in crypto","tags":["CryptoCurrency","reddit"],"date":"February 14, 2022","dateISO":"2022-02-14T10:40:43.000Z","datetime":"2022-02-14 10:40","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"ss5f5u","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ss5f5u/the_truth_about_getting_rich_in_crypto/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ss5f5u/the_truth_about_getting_rich_in_crypto/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"CryptoCurrency","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency","author":"30RITUALS","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/30RITUALS","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"30RITUALS","score":320,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"暗号で一攫千金を狙う真実","the_new_excerpt":"このとき、忘れてはいけないのが、「運」です。このことを説明しましょう。\nこのことは、私の人生経験を例にとって説明します。さあ、どうぞ。\n\n- 私と2人の友人は、1枚40ドルのビットコインというものを発見しました。\nネズミのように貧しい私たちは、全財産を集め、投資した...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"在加密货币中致富的真相","the_new_excerpt":"我们一直忘记了这一切中的一个重要组成部分：运气。让我举例说明\n这一点，用我自己的一些生活经历作为例子。我们来看看。\n\n- 我和两个朋友发现了一个叫比特币的东西，当时它是40美元一个，而莱特币是2美元一个。\n像教堂里的小老鼠一样穷，我们收集了所有的钱并投资...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"在加密貨幣中致富的真相","the_new_excerpt":"我們一直忘記了這一切中的一個重要組成部分：運氣。讓我舉例說明\n這一點，用我自己的一些生活經歷作爲例子。我們來看看。\n\n- 我和兩個朋友發現了一個叫比特幣的東西，當時它是40美元一個，而萊特幣是2美元一個。\n像教堂裏的小老鼠一樣窮，我們收集了所有的錢並投資...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-srxur9","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/srxur9/ftx_super_bowl_ad_dont_miss_out_30b/","title":"FTX Super Bowl Ad - Don't Miss Out | :30B","date":"February 14, 2022","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"FTXスーパーボウル広告 - Don't Miss Out｜:30B","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"FTX超级碗广告--不要错过 | :30B","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"FTX超級碗廣告--不要錯過 | :30B","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-srx2mi","excerpt":"Coinbase just released a floating QR code during commercial time of the Super\nBowl.
