And it was more or less like this, in the first several years after the inception of Bitcoin. We saw so much price discovery, Bitcoin being volatile, because mere mortals like us were buying, hodling, selling, wondering how much the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; price of this asset is. It was literally supply and demand, controlled only by the psychology and the individual decisions of every single one of us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What do we see nowadays? We go to bed, we wake up and we see that Bitcoin is at -10% for no reason. Literally for no reason. Neither me or you have sold. We were just sleeping. What happens? Bitcoin is strongly tied to the trading algorithms of insitutions and they handle it the same way they handle stocks. If the stock market is supposed to move down, bitcoin and crypto in general follows instantly in a nanosecond. We are not in control anymore. It doesn&amp;#39;t matter if we buy or sell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During the last few years, we welcomed institutional interest and we cheered. Now I realize that they have much more power than us and the situation is the same as it has ever been - big money controls the pennies, or in this case the satoshis, of us - the simple people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It makes me sad, but in the end, this is an open and free market. Everybody has the right to buy, sell or hold as much as he or she wants. In this case, it just happens so that the big players choose to be massively invested in crypto, which gives us the spot on the sidelines - sit and observe how the price fluctuates, without being able to react on our own.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: I agree with a lot of you guys and girls. The same way sometimes we go to bed, wake up and see that Bitcoin is +15%. In those green days, nobody complains about it. What concerns me in overall is how tied the price movement of crypto assets to the price movement traditional assets is. I am not sure if this is an issue to be concerned about. However, it&amp;#39;s a fact and I feel the necessity to talk about it and discuss it&amp;#39;s impact.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/s97zb8/bitcoin_was_supposed_to_be_the_solution_to_big/","title":"Bitcoin was supposed to be the solution to BIG MONEY.
