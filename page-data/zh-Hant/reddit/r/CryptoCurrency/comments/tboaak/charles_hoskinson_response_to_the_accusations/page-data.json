Why people are so quick to believe their own bias and take slanderous claims as facts? How did Hoskinson hurt you?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Welcome to modern-day &amp;quot;journalism&amp;quot;, where if you&amp;#39;re unfortunate enough to be relevant, you get thrown into situations where you must spend hours of your day to pull out decade-old paperwork to address whatever accusations these leeches throw at you. If you fail to do so you get canceled, if you decide to waste your time and do pull out the paperwork, those leeches won&amp;#39;t even issue an apology and they still get the clickbait that they wanted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For people wanting details about his degree, here ya go &amp;quot;At 18 an AS from front range community College in 2005. &amp;quot; - &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1502097939669434378?s=20&amp;amp;t=1zqxKMiXKZcYZQS9pzw6Wg\"&gt;https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1502097939669434378?s=20&amp;amp;t=1zqxKMiXKZcYZQS9pzw6Wg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit:\nOkay. People have mentioned that Solana thing was widely discussed here. I admit I based this assumption on few comments by people who were shitting on Hoskinson while seemingly being all fine with Solana. In retrospect, I shouldn&amp;#39;t have said anything about Solana. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But my point was, that lies about the total supply of tokens is something that is directly related to the blockchain of Sol, while this case doesn&amp;#39;t have much to do with Cardano.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, I understand that I&amp;#39;m coming off as hypocritical here myself. And I&amp;#39;m sorry for that. But I just wanted to put these things into perspective when it comes to this cancel culture of this sub.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/tboaak/charles_hoskinson_response_to_the_accusations/","title":"Charles Hoskinson response to the accusations about whether he lied about graduating or not","tags":["CryptoCurrency","reddit"],"date":"March 11, 2022","dateISO":"2022-03-11T15:42:26.000Z","datetime":"2022-03-11 15:42","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"tboaak","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/tboaak/charles_hoskinson_response_to_the_accusations/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/tboaak/charles_hoskinson_response_to_the_accusations/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"CryptoCurrency","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency","author":"Kaidanovsky","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Kaidanovsky","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Kaidanovsky","score":361,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"チャールズ・ホスキンソン、「卒業は嘘か本当か」という非難への回答","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0mEetZT9U\n\n15年前の彼の私生活の話題であることを考えると。\n\nこのサブが、この男に病的なレッテルを貼る準備がいかに早くできたか、不可解だ。\n嘘つき。\n\nソラナチームはトークンの供給量について嘘をついていたことがバレましたが\nそれは問題ない...と思ったら...。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"查尔斯-霍斯金森对有关他是否谎报毕业的指控的回应","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0mEetZT9U\n\n考虑到这是关于他个人生活的话题，15年前。\n\n令人费解的是，这个子准备给这家伙贴上病态的标签的速度如此之快\n骗子。\n\n索拉纳团队被发现在代币供应量上撒谎，但我想\n这不是一个问题....when...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"查爾斯-霍斯金森對有關他是否謊報畢業的指控的回應","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0mEetZT9U\n\n考慮到這是關於他個人生活的話題，15年前。\n\n令人費解的是，這個子準備給這傢伙貼上病態的標籤的速度如此之快\n騙子。\n\n索拉納團隊被發現在代幣供應量上撒謊，但我想\n這不是一個問題....when...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-tb8q77","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/Bitcoin/comments/tb8q77/bitcoin_fixes_this/","title":"#Bitcoin Fixes This","date":"March 11, 2022","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"#ビットコインはこれを解決する","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"#比特币解决了这个问题","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"#比特幣解決了這個問題","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-tbg1c7","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/Bitcoin/comments/tbg1c7/the_fact_that_a_man_in_charge_of_a_country_can/","title":"The fact that a man in charge of a country can start a war resulting in the countries currency value to drop to nothing is a perfect reason to adopt bitcoin;
