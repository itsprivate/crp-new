Yes, for example on July 21st, 2021 BTC went below 30k and was lower than now - but even at that point BTC was much higher than on July 21st, 2020 (a year earlier), when it was at 9k&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got into crypto in late 2020. During that whole time, whether BTC was up or down in the past days or weeks, you could always &amp;quot;zoom out&amp;quot;, look at the prices a year ago and see that it was still up a ton compared to then.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the first time since I got into crypto, this is not the case anymore. At the time I write this, BTC is down 1.5% compared to a year ago, compared to Coingecko. So I got curious: when was the last time BTC was down from a year earlier? So I got the data and looked into how BTC opening prices changed to a year earlier every day since 2013.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To answer the question: &lt;strong&gt;September 14th, 2020,&lt;/strong&gt; when it was very closely below where it was a year earlier. The last time it was lower than a year earlier for more than a few scattered days was June to July 2020, the last time it was consistently down a lot compared to a year earlier for a long time was in early 2019. &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/BfBfXWu\"&gt;Here is the data for the past 3 years in an ugly graph&lt;/a&gt;, you can see it was up for the vast majority of the time and was more than 1,000% up in March 2021 compared to March 2020.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Widening the time frame, &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/9BxCR52\"&gt;here you can see the whole time frame I analyzed&lt;/a&gt;, and, not very surprisingly, BTC has also been up compared to a year earlier for the vast majority of the time as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some more fun facts:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;BTC was up 8,671% from a year earlier on November 30th, 2013&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;BTC was down 90% from a year earlier on January 16th, 2019&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;during the whole time frame, BTC was up compared to a year earlier for 2634 days and down for 627 days&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;the longest timeframe BTC was continuously up compared to a year earlier was from December 6th, 2015 to October 31st, 2018 (1,060 days)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;the longest timeframe BTC was continuously down compared to a year earlier was from November 16th, 2014 to November 2nd, 2015 (351 days)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions, please ask!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/s0lmal/bitcoin_just_dipped_below_where_it_was_a_year_ago/","title":"Bitcoin just dipped below where it was a year ago for the first time in 16 months","tags":["CryptoCurrency","reddit"],"date":"January 10, 2022","dateISO":"2022-01-10T20:40:57.000Z","datetime":"2022-01-10 20:40","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"s0lmal","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/s0lmal/bitcoin_just_dipped_below_where_it_was_a_year_ago/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/s0lmal/bitcoin_just_dipped_below_where_it_was_a_year_ago/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"CryptoCurrency","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency","author":"mic_droo","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/mic_droo","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"mic_droo","score":339,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ビットコインは16ヶ月ぶりに1年前の水準を下回りました。","the_new_excerpt":"編集部：タイトルを誤解している人がいるようなので、私が書いたことにしておこう。\n「ビットコインは16年ぶりに1年前の水準を割り込みました。\nこの方が分かりやすいかな？\n\nEdit2: まだ私がここでやっていることを理解していない人が多いようなので、もう一度やってみます。\nこの記事を書いたとき、...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"比特币刚刚跌破一年前的水平，这是16个月以来的第一次","the_new_excerpt":"编辑：有些人似乎对标题有误解，让我们假装我写道\n\"比特币刚刚跌破一年前的水平，这是16年来第一次。\n月\"，也许这样更容易理解？\n\n编辑2：你们中的许多人仍然不明白我在这里做什么，我再试一下。\n当我写这篇文章时，...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"比特幣剛剛跌破一年前的水平，這是16個月以來的第一次","the_new_excerpt":"編輯：有些人似乎對標題有誤解，讓我們假裝我寫道\n\"比特幣剛剛跌破一年前的水平，這是16年來第一次。\n月\"，也許這樣更容易理解？\n\n編輯2：你們中的許多人仍然不明白我在這裏做什麼，我再試一下。\n當我寫這篇文章時，...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-s0j4bp","excerpt":"Many \"advocates\" of cryptocurrencies often say that the revolution is coming to\nus and that cryptocurrencies will take down Fiat.\n\nSometimes individuals remind us that the whole purpose of cryptocurrencies is\nthat a decentralized financial system allows us freedom and independence from a\nthird…","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/s0j4bp/cryptocurrencies_will_not_kill_fiat_and_people/","title":"Cryptocurrencies will not \"kill\" fiat and people who think so are ignorant.
