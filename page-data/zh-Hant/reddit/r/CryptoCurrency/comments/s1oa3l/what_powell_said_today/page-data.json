I think there was some fear originally that they would start doing the rate hikes plus tightening all at once in March.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course overall he&amp;#39;s still talking about planning for at least 3 hikes this year plus the tightening so it&amp;#39;s not like he went all out in favor of easy money, but basically it wasn&amp;#39;t the worst case scenario that was driving a lot of fear in recent days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I guess we wait patiently for the CPI numbers tomorrow-the two bullish scenarios for Bitcoin would be either lower than expected numbers causing the Fed to reduce the number of hikes or further delay tightening, or if the numbers are so freaking crazy that people think the Fed cannot control inflation at all. That said, I don&amp;#39;t think either are particularly super likely scenarios. If it comes in about what everyone is expecting or a little bit hotter then they&amp;#39;ll hike rates and tighten as planned. Whether that really is going to further impact Bitcoin is unclear-we&amp;#39;re already down 40% and while we&amp;#39;ve drawn down 80% in the past it&amp;#39;s also a much more mature asset class now and there&amp;#39;s global exposure so it&amp;#39;s not solely US policy driving price.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Powell said stablecoins A-OK, will still hike rates soon but likely tightening not until Q3-Q4. Not worst case scenario feared.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/s1oa3l/what_powell_said_today/","title":"what Powell said
