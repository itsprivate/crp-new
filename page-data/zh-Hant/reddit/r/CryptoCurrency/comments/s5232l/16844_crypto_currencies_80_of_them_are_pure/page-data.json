Still, that&amp;#39;s a shitload. No wonder some of my non crypto friends think crypto is simply a penny stock market. Those of us in the space know some project have very good intentions and fail.  Some succeed. Some just hang out. But so many others are pure scam and we all know it. I guess that is the price of decentralization and I sometimes struggle with this. We don&amp;#39;t believe in censorship so why would we be in the business of telling new projects they aren&amp;#39;t allowed because we are already too many in the room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sadly too many people will invest their life in dumb things like squid game tokens only to find no liquidity when trying to cash out. Others will simply be rug pulled. The worse part is the hit we as investors and believers of fundamentals take as it creates a bad reputation and gives crypto a terrible image. If politicians and regulators should have a beef with anything about crypto its these shady scam projects but how to determine a shady scam project until it is officially a scam. Many people in the crypto world still say Shib for example is a scam and that&amp;#39;s their opinion. Many people not in crypto say Bitcoin is a scam. Many bitcoiners say ethereum is a scam and so on.  So where do we go from here? One critique politicians often use is crypto can&amp;#39;t police itself when it comes to these scams and rug pulls so they need harsh and strict regulation to be enforced and penalized.  How can crypto police itself when project tribes can&amp;#39;t stand each other and all they do is throw each other trash on twitter. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My hope is that in time as more and more people come in there are better educational tools for noobs to be aware of what is a fire hazard but I am not optimistic. People will do what they want to do in hopes of hitting a moon shot and some shady scammers know this so I imagine that number I typed in the title will likely reach 20,000 or 25,0000 by the time 2022 is over.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/s5232l/16844_crypto_currencies_80_of_them_are_pure/","title":"16,844 crypto currencies. 80% of them are pure garbage","tags":["CryptoCurrency","reddit"],"date":"January 16, 2022","dateISO":"2022-01-16T08:40:35.000Z","datetime":"2022-01-16 08:40","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"s5232l","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/s5232l/16844_crypto_currencies_80_of_them_are_pure/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/s5232l/16844_crypto_currencies_80_of_them_are_pure/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"CryptoCurrency","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency","author":"Visible-Ad743","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Visible-Ad743","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Visible-Ad743","score":350,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"16,844の暗号通貨。そのうちの80%は純粋なゴミ","the_new_excerpt":"コインマーケットキャップによると、世界市場には16,844の暗号が存在します。\nCoin Geckoでは12,463件となっていますが。それにしても、すごい量だ。どうりで、私の周りには\n暗号を使わない友人は、暗号は単なるペニーストック市場だと考えています。私たちのような\nこの分野では、一部のプロジェクトが非常に良い意図を持っていることを知っていますし、...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"16,844种加密货币。其中80%是纯粹的垃圾","the_new_excerpt":"根据Coin Market cap的数据，世界市场上有16,844个加密货币。\n尽管Coin Gecko显示有12,463个。尽管如此，这仍然是一个巨大的数字。难怪我的一些\n非加密货币的朋友认为加密货币仅仅是一个便士股票市场。我们这些人在\n的人知道一些项目有非常好的意图，而且...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"16,844種加密貨幣。其中80%是純粹的垃圾","the_new_excerpt":"根據Coin Market cap的數據，世界市場上有16,844個加密貨幣。\n儘管Coin Gecko顯示有12,463個。儘管如此，這仍然是一個巨大的數字。難怪我的一些\n非加密貨幣的朋友認爲加密貨幣僅僅是一個便士股票市場。我們這些人在\n的人知道一些項目有非常好的意圖，而且...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-s4la8m","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/Bitcoin/comments/s4la8m/from_sand_to_black_gold_arabs_understands_the/","title":"From Sand to Black Gold.
