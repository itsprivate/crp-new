I&#39;m unsure how exactly it happens because I verified the address, but when I sent 1 BTC I did mistakenly to the wrong address!!! I verified that I was sending to the correct address, but I had to remake the sendship because the wallet crashed, probably there was the problem, the huobi&#39;s cold wallet address was in the clipboard. Anyways I don&#39;t have certainty how it happens.List:  <a href=\"https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html\">https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html</a></p>\n\n<p>It was a mistake, I work often sending and receiving BTC. When you do a certain task all the days copying wrong data could be a <strong>TERRIBLE</strong> but <strong>EASY</strong> mistake to do, because we are humans and we fall in the trust. <strong>As you did a task correctly many many times you earn trust on yourself and try save time.</strong> If it didn&#39;t happens to you ever you aren&#39;t being honest.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>7 months talking with Huobi Customer Support (part 1)</strong></p>\n\n<p>I tried to contact Huobi&#39;s customer support. First they first didn&#39;t understand me, thinking that I tried to deposit on Huobi and sent to a wrong address. After they understand they told me that the address doesn&#39;t belongs to Huobi and they can&#39;t help me. That is false, I did an investigation and they have direct relation with this address, they can help me. Read my following analysis please:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Huobi Ownership Analysis</strong></p>\n\n<p>Searching, sites says that the address belongs to Huobi Huobi support says that address doesn&#39;t belongs to Huobi</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t know if belongs to Huobi or not, but I can deduct and track that the address is related with Huobi</p>\n\n<p>Why? The address 3Cbq7aT1tY8kMxWLbitaG7yT6bPbKChq64 regulary sent big amounts to 1LAnF8h3qMGx3TSwNUHVneBZUEpwE4gu3D</p>\n\n<p>Then, is VERY PROBABLY THAT 3Cbq7aT1tY8kMxWLbitaG7yT6bPbKChq64 OWNER KNOWS 1LAnF8h3qMGx3TSwNUHVneBZUEpwE4gu3D OWNER And the 1LAnF8h3qMGx3TSwNUHVneBZUEpwE4gu3D OWNER can help me.</p>\n\n<p>Searching, some sites (and sites like USDT Official page <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20181113185656/https://wallet.tether.to/richlist\">https://web.archive.org/web/20181113185656/https://wallet.tether.to/richlist</a>) says that the address 1LAnF8h3qMGx3TSwNUHVneBZUEpwE4gu3D belongs to Huobi</p>\n\n<p>Again, I don&#39;t know really if the address is of Huobi, but I can deduct and track that the address is related with Huobi</p>\n\n<p>Why? On my Huobi account I made only 2 BTC withdraws from Huobi in the past</p>\n\n<p>2018-05-08 18:36:45 , txid: 0e6bf02323ebc166b6638afcd6170ecb73948748235e687def7e7a3cb1902fca , it has 239 inputs 2018-05-08 20:17:10 , txid: b59b988d642fe3773268e246ef1a0d048bbd3f734a611d00722b39126ed9e20b , it has 239 inputs too</p>\n\n<p>In both transaction, all inputs are addresses that BELONGS TO HUOBI, because you huobi are sending me BTC</p>\n\n<p>Both transactions has 39 addresses as inputs in common (all huobi address, maybe deposit addresses of anothers huobi users)</p>\n\n<p>Example: 1M9ndPSQ4fmMKaKW2oX7LtjduDqYUcFKCW</p>\n\n<p>Analyzing the transactions of this address, we can found many transactions sending BTC to 1LAnF8h3qMGx3TSwNUHVneBZUEpwE4gu3D OWNER</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.blockchain.com/es/btc/tx/740236113bde5a95cfc168d732762be00eee435556c686b00b74b85b3e6c3f77\">https://www.blockchain.com/es/btc/tx/740236113bde5a95cfc168d732762be00eee435556c686b00b74b85b3e6c3f77</a><a href=\"https://www.blockchain.com/es/btc/tx/e2367daa464818d46da93e9a364f23536ef31e767f04cd01ff0a01e2baca6f87\">https://www.blockchain.com/es/btc/tx/e2367daa464818d46da93e9a364f23536ef31e767f04cd01ff0a01e2baca6f87</a><a href=\"https://www.blockchain.com/es/btc/tx/5c16244c0efaba9aeb1e141e9ff4c8702f7a34f44bac73121ea6f55eb98adab2\">https://www.blockchain.com/es/btc/tx/5c16244c0efaba9aeb1e141e9ff4c8702f7a34f44bac73121ea6f55eb98adab2</a><a href=\"https://www.blockchain.com/es/btc/tx/69e73d1bbcdcb8ffacf0ea555298ee226f1740c02d1131e2db72e7ade32aace1\">https://www.blockchain.com/es/btc/tx/69e73d1bbcdcb8ffacf0ea555298ee226f1740c02d1131e2db72e7ade32aace1</a><a href=\"https://www.blockchain.com/es/btc/tx/110eff2733a88b626ca38d63b9f2d8b6d5b3e26574f1d918c99c36c785eb0d56\">https://www.blockchain.com/es/btc/tx/110eff2733a88b626ca38d63b9f2d8b6d5b3e26574f1d918c99c36c785eb0d56</a></p>\n\n<p>User withdraw?

I&#39;m waiting 7 months ago, all months I ask and they ever reply the same &quot;We will contact you&quot;. Now they told me &quot; Hello，sorry for the inconvenience, we feedback your problem to our technology department.  After a series of research and development, but it can not be solved.  Please understand this.  &quot;</p>\n\n<p>I want to think that the team is failing and Huobi isn&#39;t wanting steal my BTC.
