The memes, the fear, the panic, and the echo chamber quality of it all.  But above all, I stay for the quality memes.  Here are some of my musings.  Hopefully it can offer some comfort for those of you who bought at ATH.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) Don&amp;#39;t mention explicitly the total amount that you have.  I made this mistake early on and the amount of &amp;quot;advice&amp;quot; I got to sell from the original run from 1000 to 3000 was incredibly irritating.  You cannot imagine how much louder it got from the 17k or 18k peak when it went all the way back down to 4k or 5k.  The panic was everywhere.  Do not be surprised if the same happens again on this downturn. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) Stick to the fundamentals.  Price discovery does not necessarily reflect the underlying value of bitcoin.  Are blocks being mined? Are transactions being processed? If yes, just keep your head down and continue holding.  I anticipate, even expect, that bitcoin will keep getting attacked; bad actors will keep coming and going (Jihan, your tweet will forever be hilarious).  If you want to do your part (and can afford to), run a node.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) Please do not trade (including leveraged trades).  I started off as a &amp;quot;trader&amp;quot;.  I started with 100 and tried to do the compound math game of closing the day with 5% gains.  Being able to pull it off for a few days in a row (in a bull market), I thought I was a genius then all those years ago.  After a month, however, I ended up with slightly less than 100.  Then, by a sheer stroke of luck, it clicked for me that trading was a fool&amp;#39;s game.  Most traders lose.  I did not think I was the exception to the rule.  It was after this moment I started to just quickly buy and hold.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4) For whatever reason, being in bitcoin has somehow changed my spending habits and how I view material things.  I try to live on less and I try to unsubscribe from the endless consumerism that is everywhere.  It almost feels as if unchecked consumerism, inflation, and capitalism are all somehow interconnected for me.  Someone else can probably word it more eloquently.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5) I have found it helpful to view bitcoin as a savings vehicle.  I continue to buy today, even when it was above 55000, 40000, etc.  It does not matter.  I just want to protect what &amp;quot;value&amp;quot; I have in FIAT from getting eroded by monetary policies that do not quite seem to benefit the small fish.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;6) I have not found it helpful to talk about it with friends and family.  So I mostly stay quiet now, even going so far as to feign ignorance on the topic if needed.  I think I am terrible at explaining it (might be why).  The reactions I have seen over the years are is that it is fake, can be manipulated, what if it goes to 0, what if I am wrong, and when will I sell?  I rarely try to correct their thinking.  I do subscribe to the quote that people will buy into it at the price they deserve.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;7) I must confess, I have not read the whitepaper.  I have copies of it, but I have never read it.  Yes, this is heresy.&lt;/del&gt;  At the encouragement of some, I mustered up the courage to read the whitepaper.  It was not as scary as I thought!  Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;8) I do not own anything else.  I just do not understand it.  There are so many technical terms now that are thrown around.  It is intimidating.  I remember receiving messages back in the day when a certain coin, starting with E, was priced at $3.  Maybe some of you can too.  What I have seen, however, is that a lot of these other things come and go, like the seasons.  I wonder why that is. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;9) Stay for the memes! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I cannot and do not say these things in real life anymore.  May this help some of you new bitizens in this space.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PS. Hopefully, I did not make any typing errors.  English is not my main language!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Thanks for the gold and love awards random bitizens! Never gotten these before =)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","slug":"/reddit/r/Bitcoin/comments/unehob/musings_from_someone_who_has_been_buying_since/","title":"Musings from someone who has been buying since 250 US dollars /bitcoin","tags":["Bitcoin","reddit"],"date":"May 12, 2022","dateISO":"2022-05-12T03:37:27.000Z","datetime":"2022-05-12 03:37","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"unehob","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/unehob/musings_from_someone_who_has_been_buying_since/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/unehob/musings_from_someone_who_has_been_buying_since/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"Bitcoin","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin","author":"PatientKosong","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/PatientKosong","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"PatientKosong","score":303,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"250米ドル/ビットコインから買い続けている人のつぶやき","the_new_excerpt":"このサブタイトルは、もう8年近くも私の後ろめたい楽しみとなっています。ミーム。\n恐怖、パニック、そしてその反響の大きさ。しかし、何よりも、私は\n質の高いミームのために滞在しています。以下は、私の考察の一部です。うまくいけば\nATHで購入された方々の慰めになれば幸いです。\n\n1) やめなさい...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"一个从250美元/比特币开始购买的人的感想","the_new_excerpt":"这款潜艇已经成为我的一个有罪的乐趣，至今已有近8年。这些备忘录。\n恐惧，恐慌，以及它的回声室质量。但最重要的是，我\n留在这里是为了高质量的备忘录。这里有我的一些想法。希望它能提供\n为你们这些在ATH买房的人提供一些安慰。\n\n1）不要...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"一個從250美元/比特幣開始購買的人的感想","the_new_excerpt":"這款潛艇已經成爲我的一個有罪的樂趣，至今已有近8年。這些備忘錄。\n恐懼，恐慌，以及它的回聲室質量。但最重要的是，我\n留在這裏是爲了高質量的備忘錄。這裏有我的一些想法。希望它能提供\n爲你們這些在ATH買房的人提供一些安慰。\n\n1）不要...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-reddit-placeholder-1","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/dankmemes/comments/kc0vb6/i_tried_my_best/","title":"I tried my best","date":"January 01, 1970","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"我尽力了","the_new_excerpt":"test","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我盡力了","the_new_excerpt":"test","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-unls6e","excerpt":"Crypto exists in a space that is largely a completely unregulated free market.\nIf your crypto project can be made worthless due to some economic actors\nperforming a free market action, then that coin never had any worth to begin\nwith.
