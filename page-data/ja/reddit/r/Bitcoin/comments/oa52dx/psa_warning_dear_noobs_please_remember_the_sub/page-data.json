I&#39;ve seen a couple of noobs stumble upon the abovementioned sub / websites, thinking that these resources represent BTC. Indeed, they are trying very hard to conceil the fact that they are a miniscule and unimportant part of the space trying to gain significance. However, they failed doing so over the course of the last 3-4 years.</p>\n\n<p>In short, they are trying to push a fake Bitcoin clone called B.CH (I&#39;m writing the dot because auto-mod doesn&#39;t like talk about alt-coins). If you don&#39;t know about the history of how these sites came about, google &quot;the fork war&quot; during 2017. You&#39;ll see that a faction of people split up from Bitcoin (thank god) to roll out their own shitcoin. However, at this point, they are basically a bunch of bitter propagandists, defining their community as being &quot;against&quot; BTC, and trying to trick noobs into thinking that their fork is the &quot;real&quot; Bitcoin. </p>\n\n<p>You&#39;ll see that their main argument is that this sub is heavily cens.ored (which is true, look how ridiculous I am trying to avoid auto-deletions), but the reason for that is not to silence opposing views (we can discuss about opposing technical views here all day), but mostly to keep this sub clean (imagine what it would look like here, if moderation wasn&#39;t harsh. Ever been on Twitter?) </p>\n\n<p>In any case: STAY AWAY FROM THESE TOXIC PLACES. They operate through hate and fear and you&#39;ll learn things only from one single perspective. Do your own research. Do not trust but verify.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Edit: <strong>They have spotted this post!</strong> Shitcoin downvote army incoming, brace yourself! They will shill &quot;why not diversify&quot; or &quot;there are better crypto&#39;s out there&quot;, &quot;Lightning network doesn&#39;t work&quot; and the same shxt they&#39;ve been repeating over and over.</p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: This post has gone from 95% upvoted to 79% in an instant ;) Nice.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON
