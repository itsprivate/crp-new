But this past conference, it just really felt weak and ineffective.  Many of the guests really just wanted to talk about their company, or their book, or whatever project they were working on, and just kind of rambled on it.  Far too much talk about crypto in general, and not really much about Bitcoin itself.  Not a lot of macroeconomic analysis and commentary.  Even the star-studded panel with Serena Williams/Aaron Rodgers/Odell Beckham Jr. was pretty cringey and awkward for a lot of it.  Cynthia Lummis was really ramble-bamble-ish.  Even the panel with Adam Back got stuck in the weeds with no roadmap out.  And to top it all off, the Bull was missing his Balls.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last year, the 2021 conference had the WTF Happened in 1971 guys, Lawrence Lepard and a bunch of just really good, articulate presentations about economics and Bitcoin itself.  This year it really kind of ran off track, IMO.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What did you guys think?
