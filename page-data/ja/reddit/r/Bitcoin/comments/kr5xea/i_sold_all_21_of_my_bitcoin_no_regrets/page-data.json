The price was a little over $300 and it was trending slowly down. (I vaguely remember a very short-term dip into the $100s during 2015. Feel free to verify.)</p>\n\n<p>I was attracted to BTC for a few reasons: </p>\n\n<p>1) Demand: It aligned with my libertarian values. I was a big fan of Ron Paul and his “End the Fed” ideology. BTC seemed like a nice answer to the endless QE. </p>\n\n<p>2) Limited Supply: BTC is fundamentally designed for price increases. I’m no intellect, but limited supply + demand = ⬆️ valuation. </p>\n\n<p>3) Access/affordability: despite a small learning curve, it was much easier to buy shares of BTC than it was to buy BRK.A</p>\n\n<p>So, I DCA’d my way to 21 Bitcoins over the next couple of years, along with a basket of Alts. </p>\n\n<p>I was single living overseas during the 2017 bull run. </p>\n\n<p>I wanted to move to the US, so I nearly fully liquidated, bought a house, started a family, and started a business. </p>\n\n<p>No regrets. </p>\n\n<p>When BTC hits $50k this year, I’ll take a moment to reflect on what a 7 digit bank account might have felt like. </p>\n\n<p>And that’s it, just one moment. </p>\n\n<p>BTC changed my life. BTC gave me freedom. </p>\n\n<p>I will never, in a million years, regret that. </p>\n\n<p>So yes, we “all have a price.” If you get the opportunity to change your life permanently, take it. </p>\n\n<p>And before you scream “FUD!” Think again. </p>\n\n<p>Selling, does not mean selling out. </p>\n\n<p>Once my life got aligned, I started buying back in. Odds are, I’ll never have 21 BTC again, but my life now has meaning. I provide value to my family and community. Including the BTC community. </p>\n\n<p>I will buy till I die.</p>\n\n<p>Moral of the story: Take your time. Don’t get greedy. Keep perspective. Fuck FOMO. Fuck regret. Do you. And be grateful that you live in a time when there is no better access to life changing returns and freedom from a tyrannical monetary system. </p>\n\n<p>Even if you live paycheck to paycheck. A little savings in BTC will pay huge in the long run. </p>\n\n<p>HODL.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/Bitcoin/comments/kr5xea/i_sold_all_21_of_my_bitcoin_no_regrets/","title":"I sold
