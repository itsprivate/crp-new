The price was a little over $300 and it was trending slowly down. (I vaguely remember a very short-term dip into the $100s during 2015. Feel free to verify.)</p>\n\n<p>I was attracted to BTC for a few reasons: </p>\n\n<p>1) Demand: It aligned with my libertarian values. I was a big fan of Ron Paul and his “End the Fed” ideology. BTC seemed like a nice answer to the endless QE. </p>\n\n<p>2) Limited Supply: BTC is fundamentally designed for price increases. I’m no intellect, but limited supply + demand = ⬆️ valuation. </p>\n\n<p>3) Access/affordability: despite a small learning curve, it was much easier to buy shares of BTC than it was to buy BRK.A</p>\n\n<p>So, I DCA’d my way to 21 Bitcoins over the next couple of years, along with a basket of Alts. </p>\n\n<p>I was single living overseas during the 2017 bull run. </p>\n\n<p>I wanted to move to the US, so I nearly fully liquidated, bought a house, started a family, and started a business. </p>\n\n<p>No regrets. </p>\n\n<p>When BTC hits $50k this year, I’ll take a moment to reflect on what a 7 digit bank account might have felt like. </p>\n\n<p>And that’s it, just one moment. </p>\n\n<p>BTC changed my life. BTC gave me freedom. </p>\n\n<p>I will never, in a million years, regret that. </p>\n\n<p>So yes, we “all have a price.” If you get the opportunity to change your life permanently, take it. </p>\n\n<p>And before you scream “FUD!” Think again. </p>\n\n<p>Selling, does not mean selling out. </p>\n\n<p>Once my life got aligned, I started buying back in. Odds are, I’ll never have 21 BTC again, but my life now has meaning. I provide value to my family and community. Including the BTC community. </p>\n\n<p>I will buy till I die.</p>\n\n<p>Moral of the story: Take your time. Don’t get greedy. Keep perspective. Fuck FOMO. Fuck regret. Do you. And be grateful that you live in a time when there is no better access to life changing returns and freedom from a tyrannical monetary system. </p>\n\n<p>Even if you live paycheck to paycheck. A little savings in BTC will pay huge in the long run. </p>\n\n<p>HODL.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/Bitcoin/comments/kr5xea/i_sold_all_21_of_my_bitcoin_no_regrets/","title":"I sold all 21 of my Bitcoin - No Regrets","tags":["Bitcoin","reddit"],"date":"January 05, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-05T21:30:26.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-05 21:30","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"kr5xea","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/kr5xea/i_sold_all_21_of_my_bitcoin_no_regrets/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/kr5xea/i_sold_all_21_of_my_bitcoin_no_regrets/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"Bitcoin","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin","author":"Laymancoin","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Laymancoin","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Laymancoin","score":5521,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"我把我所有的21枚比特币都卖了--没有遗憾","the_new_excerpt":"我在2014年底左右第一次购买了BTC。价格有点过高了。\n300美元，而且有缓慢下降的趋势。(我依稀记得有一次非常短期的下跌\n在2015年达到100多美元。请随时核实。)\n\n我被BTC吸引有几个原因：\n\n1)需求：它与我的自由意志主义…保持一致","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我把我所有的21枚比特幣都賣了--沒有遺憾","the_new_excerpt":"我在2014年底左右第一次購買了BTC。價格有點過高了。\n300美元，而且有緩慢下降的趨勢。(我依稀記得有一次非常短期的下跌\n在2015年達到100多美元。請隨時覈實。)\n\n我被BTC吸引有幾個原因：\n\n1)需求：它與我的自由意志主義…保持一致","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-reddit-placeholder-1","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/dankmemes/comments/kc0vb6/i_tried_my_best/","title":"I tried my best","date":"January 01, 1970","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"我尽力了","the_new_excerpt":"test","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我盡力了","the_new_excerpt":"test","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-reddit-placeholder-1","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/dankmemes/comments/kc0vb6/i_tried_my_best/","title":"I tried my best","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"January 01, 1970","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"我尽力了","the_new_excerpt":"test","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我盡力了","the_new_excerpt":"test","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-kr5xea","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":{"siteUrl":"https://crypto.buzzing.cc","author":"Buzzing.cc","locale":"zh","title":"加密货币国外热门讨论","shortTitle":"加密货币","description":"用中文浏览关于加密货币的国外热门讨论","keywords":["buzzing","加密货币","比特币","数字货币","区块链"],"telegram":"@buzzingcc","telegram_chat_id":"-1001406368978","iconUrl":"https://crypto.buzzing.cc/avatar.png","menuLinks":[{"name":"每周精选","url":"/issues"}],"subscriptions":[{"name":"Twitter @buzzingcc","url":"https://twitter.com/buzzingcc","external":true},{"name":"Telegram @buzzingcc","url":"https://t.me/buzzingcc","external":true},{"name":"RSS","url":"/rss.xml","prefetch":false}],"social":[{"name":"Crypto Currency小组","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency","external":true},{"name":"比特币小组","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin","external":true},{"name":"Buzzing","url":"https://www.buzzing.cc/","external":true}],"localize":[{"locale":"en","title":"Buzzing on Crypto","shortTitle":"BuzzCrypto","description":"See what's buzzing on Crypto in your native language","keywords":["buzzing","crypto","bitcoin","blockchain"],"menuLinks":[{"name":"Weekly Selection","url":"/en/issues"}],"social":[{"name":"Crypto Currency Subreddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency","external":true},{"name":"Bitcoin Subreddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin","external":true},{"name":"Buzzing","url":"https://www.buzzing.cc/","external":true}]},{"locale":"zh-Hant","title":"加密貨幣國外熱門討論","shortTitle":"加密貨幣","description":"用中文瀏覽關於加密貨幣的國外熱門討論","keywords":["buzzing","加密貨幣","比特幣","數字貨幣","區塊鏈"],"menuLinks":[{"name":"每週精選","url":"/zh-Hant/issues"}],"social":[{"name":"Crypto Currency小組","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency","external":true},{"name":"比特幣小組","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin","external":true},{"name":"Buzzing","url":"https://www.buzzing.cc/zh-Hant","external":true}]},{"locale":"ja","title":"暗号通貨人気の応答","shortTitle":"暗号通貨人気","description":"人気の暗号通貨記事を日本語で閲覧","keywords":["buzzing","暗号通貨"],"menuLinks":[{"name":"毎週の選択","url":"/jp/issues"}],"social":[{"name":"Crypto Currency","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency","external":true},{"name":"BTC Group","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin","external":true},{"name":"Buzzing","url":"https://www.buzzing.cc/zh-Hant","external":true}]}],"defaultSocialImageUrl":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1624129591276-5b11185e7b42?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=2739&q=80"},"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/Bitcoin/comments/kr5xea/i_sold_all_21_of_my_bitcoin_no_regrets/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},
