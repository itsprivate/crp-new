And bitcoin was starting to become well... bitcoin actually.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However as some early adopter were starting to pay attention to the cryptocurrency they quickly realized than more than a value reserve or a trustworthy currency, crypto could be used to avoid goverment restrictions and to survive lawsuits by shady individuals. The first of wich was a Brazilian youtuber names Daniel Fraga.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Daniel Fraga career began quite small, he was an anarchocapitalist youtuber with a camera and a confrontational personality with two goals. To get people started into what he tought was the next currency in the name of bitcoin and to denounce goverment corruption and mismanagement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Video by video the young ancap began to build an audience, he was one of the first to make portuguese tutorials on how to buy and store bitcoins. And he was also extremely anti state, constantly making videos about corruption scandals, how to avoid taxation and actively calling Brazilian IRS officials and politicians &amp;quot;thieves and robbers&amp;quot; for their role both in seizing people&amp;#39;s assets as well as their participation in corruption scandals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It didnt take long for these people to notice the now sizeable videos agaisnt them, videos in wich even exposed politicians about their mishandling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Angry about being called out by a guy who was just a youtuber back in the time where youtubers werent even seen as a professional, these politicians and IRS agents began to fight back. They began to file multiple slapsuits agaisnt the youtuber, demanding that he would take down his videos and pay back for his &amp;quot;slanders&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ever an ANCAP, Mr Fraga refused to even receive the police officers carrying his court summon. Telling them to shove the lawsuit on his backyard and leave.\nThe man even refused to show up in court, not acknowledging the state justice authority in a case that he saw was an attempt by authorities to silence him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Without defence Brazil courts began to award the ones filing lawsuits agaisnt him. 2 IRS workers wered awarded thousands of USD in compensation, and a politician was even awarded 400k USD in &amp;quot;damages&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And this would have been it for the man, he would have been bankrupted by the state and forced to take his video down.\nThat is...if bitcoin wasnt a thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rather, Mr Fraga had a brilliant idea, rather than fatten the pocket lines of politicians he decided to gamble it all. He sold every single one of his assets, his house, cars, personal belongings and dumped all into BTC.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then the absolute chad of a man, made a last youtube video, mocking the judge and daring him to find a way to seize his BTC wallet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To his credit the judges and lawyers tried, they searched up and down for any seizable asset, they visited dozens of addresses and went after anything he could ever own. And after years searching they found absolutely nothing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally without finding a single cent (well they did find around 200USD on a google account that was being used to pay for some really old process for google), the judge and lawyers gave up. They proclaimed the debt could not be payed and abandoned the search.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Daniel Fraga then dissapeared, vanished from public view with his bitcoins still stored in his wallet. And was never seen again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Small updates on his youtube channel (such as a link of him promoting BCH) show that he is still alive. But for the man who had won thr battle agaisnt an entire state, it seems all he wished for was to rest in his (presumably insanely large) wealth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And thus end the story of how BTC allowed a man to stand up to politicians, judges, lawyers and police officers. His reasons of his own volition, but his story filled with an insane tale of risk taking and protesting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tought this was an important tale to tell, for since it happend in Brazil, very few know about it. And that it comes to show how Bitcoin can help individuals to stand up to the state and repression.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do not know if Mr Fraga reasons were correct, or if what he did was right. But i admire his dedication to a cause to the point of gambling his life on the promess of crypto, back in the day where most still tought crypto was a pyramid scheme.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a law student myself its still a tale that fascinates me. How one guy managed to defeat the state.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sources: (sadly in portuguese, i wish i could get you guys good english sources but i cant :( )&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://cointimes.com.br/daniel-fraga-pioneiro-do-bitcoin-divulga-novo-site-e-gera-polemica/amp/\"&gt;https://cointimes.com.br/daniel-fraga-pioneiro-do-bitcoin-divulga-novo-site-e-gera-polemica/amp/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://portaldobitcoin.uol.com.br/pioneiro-do-bitcoin-daniel-fraga-da-sinal-de-vida-no-youtube/\"&gt;https://portaldobitcoin.uol.com.br/pioneiro-do-bitcoin-daniel-fraga-da-sinal-de-vida-no-youtube/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://portaldobitcoin.uol.com.br/justica-nao-encontra-daniel-fraga-e-arquiva-processo-de-deputada-que-pedia-r-1-milhao/\"&gt;https://portaldobitcoin.uol.com.br/justica-nao-encontra-daniel-fraga-e-arquiva-processo-de-deputada-que-pedia-r-1-milhao/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://portaldobitcoin.uol.com.br/justica-caca-daniel-fraga-o-pioneiro-do-bitcoin-no-brasil-mas-nao-consegue-encontra-lo/\"&gt;https://portaldobitcoin.uol.com.br/justica-caca-daniel-fraga-o-pioneiro-do-bitcoin-no-brasil-mas-nao-consegue-encontra-lo/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*EDIT: Changed the date text soo its clearer when it happened (around 2015).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","slug":"/reddit/r/Bitcoin/comments/royp5i/the_history_of_how_bitcoin_made_an_individual/","title":"The History of How Bitcoin made an individual ungovernable","tags":["Bitcoin","reddit"],"date":"December 27, 2021","dateISO":"2021-12-27T04:37:28.000Z","datetime":"2021-12-27 04:37","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"royp5i","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/royp5i/the_history_of_how_bitcoin_made_an_individual/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/royp5i/the_history_of_how_bitcoin_made_an_individual/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"Bitcoin","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin","author":"ArthurSalim","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ArthurSalim","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"ArthurSalim","score":160,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ビットコインが個人を無統制にした歴史","the_new_excerpt":"2015年代、インターネットが高速化し、コンピュータが普及し始めた頃です。\n本当に賢くなり始めていたのです。そしてビットコインが普及し始め...\nビットコインになりつつありました。\n\nしかし、一部のアーリーアダプターは、このビットコインに注目し始めていました。\n暗号通貨は、その名の通り、\"暗号 \"なのです。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"比特币如何让一个人变得不可理喻的历史","the_new_excerpt":"想象一下，那是2015年代，互联网开始变得快速，计算机\n开始变得真正智能。而比特币也开始变得......。\n实际上是比特币。\n\n然而，当一些早期采用者开始关注这个\n加密货币，他们很快就意识到，比起一个...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"比特幣如何讓一個人變得不可理喻的歷史","the_new_excerpt":"想象一下，那是2015年代，互聯網開始變得快速，計算機\n開始變得真正智能。而比特幣也開始變得......。\n實際上是比特幣。\n\n然而，當一些早期採用者開始關注這個\n加密貨幣，他們很快就意識到，比起一個...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-rp68xe","excerpt":"A whole nation which buy BTC as a national reserve, this has its advantages and\ndisadvantages.\n\nSo far they they were making profit, but let's say we hit a bear market at a\ncertain moment in time (I'm not to wake up bears in hibernation, I like bulls\nmore, but just talking in theory),\n\nwhat would…","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rp68xe/what_will_happen_to_el_salvador_in_case_of_a_bear/","title":"What will happen to El Salvador in case of a bear market?","date":"December 27, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"弱気相場になった場合、エルサルバドルはどうなるのでしょうか？","the_new_excerpt":"国家備蓄として国全体でBTCを購入する、これにはメリットとデメリットがあります。\nデメリットがあります。\n\n今までは利益を出していましたが、ある時、弱気相場に突入したとします。\n冬眠中の熊を起こすわけではありません。\n理論的な話です）。\n\nどうだろう","locale":"ja"},{"title":"如果出现熊市，萨尔瓦多会发生什么？","the_new_excerpt":"整个国家购买BTC作为国家储备，这有其优点和缺点。\n劣势。\n\n到目前为止，他们是盈利的，但假设我们在某一时刻遇到熊市\n我不是要唤醒冬眠中的熊市，我更喜欢牛市。\n更喜欢牛市，但只是理论上的说法）。\n\n会有什么...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"如果出現熊市，薩爾瓦多會發生什麼？","the_new_excerpt":"整個國家購買BTC作爲國家儲備，這有其優點和缺點。\n劣勢。\n\n到目前爲止，他們是盈利的，但假設我們在某一時刻遇到熊市\n我不是要喚醒冬眠中的熊市，我更喜歡牛市。\n更喜歡牛市，但只是理論上的說法）。\n\n會有什麼...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-row9wp","excerpt":"Love the guy.
