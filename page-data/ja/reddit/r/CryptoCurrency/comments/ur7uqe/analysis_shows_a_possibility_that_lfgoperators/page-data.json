And on 10th, UST opened at 93c and fell to as low as 62c! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those who were on the other side of these initial trades were able to redeem their UST almost at a $1 peg, as LFG bought their coins. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Who were at the end of these trades, only LFG and other insiders seem to know. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This whole thing is murky af, and this kind of suspicions is enough to call for an audit of the entire transaction history by a reputed audit firm. Around $40 BN worth assets were burnt to the ground in this mess, it is not a small amount by any means. The Mcap destroyed in this is comparable to the mcap of Lehmann Brothers. Whats worse is that UST mcap was actually dollar denominated debt held by many retail users. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;LFG and all the operators/insiders involved should provide maximum transparency around these trades.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ur7uqe/analysis_shows_a_possibility_that_lfgoperators/","title":"Analysis shows a possibility that LFG/operators allowed VCs and insiders to be bailed out at $1 peg with their early trades, while retail holders took the slack and lost almost everything","tags":["CryptoCurrency","reddit"],"date":"May 17, 2022","dateISO":"2022-05-17T06:45:39.000Z","datetime":"2022-05-17 06:45","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"ur7uqe","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ur7uqe/analysis_shows_a_possibility_that_lfgoperators/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ur7uqe/analysis_shows_a_possibility_that_lfgoperators/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"CryptoCurrency","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency","author":"Set1Less","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Set1Less","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Set1Less","score":308,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"分析によると、LFG/オペレーターは、VCやインサイダーが初期の取引で1ペッグで救済されるのを許し、リテールホルダーはそのままでほぼすべてを失った可能性がある。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"分析显示出一种可能性，即LFG/操作者允许风险投资公司和内部人士在1美元的挂牌交易中被保释出来，而散户持有者则承担了责任，几乎损失殆尽。","the_new_excerpt":"交易分析发现了一系列可能的交易。\n有可能使少数持有人几乎以100%的比例套现，而大多数人\n持到很晚，失去了他们所有的储蓄。\n\n这变得更加可疑，因为LFG和其他运营商都没有发布\n的证据。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"分析顯示出一種可能性，即LFG/操作者允許風險投資公司和內部人士在1美元的掛牌交易中被保釋出來，而散戶持有者則承擔了責任，幾乎損失殆盡。","the_new_excerpt":"交易分析發現了一系列可能的交易。\n有可能使少數持有人幾乎以100%的比例套現，而大多數人\n持到很晚，失去了他們所有的儲蓄。\n\n這變得更加可疑，因爲LFG和其他運營商都沒有發佈\n的證據。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-uqyw9m","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/uqyw9m/76b_in_tether_has_been_withdraw_since_thursday/","title":"$7.6b in Tether has been withdraw since Thursday.
