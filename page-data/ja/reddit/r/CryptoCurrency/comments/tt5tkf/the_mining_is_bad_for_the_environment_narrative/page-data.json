Would media conglomerates push a &amp;quot;bad for the environment&amp;quot; narrative if it didn&amp;#39;t serve some kind of purpose? These are the same people who continue to refute climate change because the owners profit from oil extraction. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Proof of stake is not a true iteration on proof of work because it removes market externalities from the system. In proof of stake, there are no miners. The rich don&amp;#39;t actually have to spend any money to profit, they just stake it. The person who holds the most coins holds all the power. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In pow, miners have to spend money to buy new equipment and maintain it. Thus, their fortunes are used in the economy, creating a system that sustains itself by forcing those who maintain it to actually spend the asset they&amp;#39;re maintaining. This is not true of proof of stake, which actually encourages people to not use the currency at all. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hear all kinds of pros for proof of stake, but I&amp;#39;ve never had someone directly refute the argument against it, that it does not have market externalities and thus is not a sustainable economic system. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would love to hear some comments to that point specifically. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By debasing Proof of Work, the type of cryptocurrencies that can actually threaten world governments&amp;#39; control over the monetary supply, they push crypto users to the less viable proof of stake chains. It also represents a classic divide and conquer tactic. Creating the division in philosophies between crypto users takes the target off the backs of controlling governments that are only trying to preserve their power in terms of monetary supply and the movement of funds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I&amp;#39;m not disputing energy use is bad for the environment. But, driving cars is bad for the environment, watching tv is bad for the environment, washing dishes.. you get the point. Im saying the government and media don&amp;#39;t care about the environment except when it sells a narrative, and I&amp;#39;m saying that I think PoW is worth spending energy on, and I&amp;#39;m saying if there were an alternative that used less energy I&amp;#39;d be all for it, but I don&amp;#39;t think PoS is a viable alternative that achieves what PoW achieves, economically speaking.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/tt5tkf/the_mining_is_bad_for_the_environment_narrative/","title":"The \"mining is bad for the environment\" narrative was created to debase PoW because it's a bigger threat to government control.","tags":["CryptoCurrency","reddit"],"date":"April 01, 2022","dateISO":"2022-04-01T13:01:30.000Z","datetime":"2022-04-01 13:01","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"tt5tkf","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/tt5tkf/the_mining_is_bad_for_the_environment_narrative/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/tt5tkf/the_mining_is_bad_for_the_environment_narrative/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"CryptoCurrency","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency","author":"DATY4944","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/DATY4944","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"DATY4944","score":307,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"マイニングは環境に悪い」というシナリオは、PoWを貶めるために作られたもので、政府のコントロールに対する脅威の方が大きいからです。","the_new_excerpt":"なぜ、これほどまでにプルーフ・オブ・ワークに対して厳しい意見があるのでしょうか？メディアは\nコングロマリットが「環境に悪い」というシナリオを押し付けるのは、それが何らかの役に立たなければ\nということなのでしょうか？気候変動に反論し続ける人たちと同じです。\n石油採掘でオーナーに利益があるからです。\n\nその証拠に...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"采矿对环境有害 \"的说法是为了贬低PoW，因为它对政府控制的威胁更大。","the_new_excerpt":"你认为为什么会有如此强烈的反对工作证明的声音？媒体\n如果不是为了达到某种目的，媒体集团会推动 \"不利于环境 \"的说法吗？\n某种目的？这些人也是继续反驳气候变化的人\n因为他们的老板从石油开采中获利。\n\n证明...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"採礦對環境有害 \"的說法是爲了貶低PoW，因爲它對政府控制的威脅更大。","the_new_excerpt":"你認爲爲什麼會有如此強烈的反對工作證明的聲音？媒體\n如果不是爲了達到某種目的，媒體集團會推動 \"不利於環境 \"的說法嗎？\n某種目的？這些人也是繼續反駁氣候變化的人\n因爲他們的老闆從石油開採中獲利。\n\n證明...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-reddit-placeholder-1","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/dankmemes/comments/kc0vb6/i_tried_my_best/","title":"I tried my best","date":"January 01, 1970","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"我尽力了","the_new_excerpt":"test","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我盡力了","the_new_excerpt":"test","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-ttmlcp","excerpt":"The often so-called progressive forces from left-wing and green parties were the\ndriving forces in sealing the fate of the DeFi sector and crypto in general in\nthe EU.
