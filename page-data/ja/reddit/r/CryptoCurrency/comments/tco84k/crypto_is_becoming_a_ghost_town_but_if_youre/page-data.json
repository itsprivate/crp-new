After an exciting year in 2021, the cryptocurrency space is becoming a ghost town, like the elders from 2017 prophesied. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am not just talking about prices, which has been depressed for a few weeks now ; the hype surrounding our ecosystem is fading. Google Trends clearly shows that searches for terms like &amp;quot;bitcoin&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;NFT&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;crypto&amp;quot; are at their lowest level since summer, and the activity on this sub has been falling off a cliff. The Daily barely have 2k comments...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But here&amp;#39;s the deal : &lt;strong&gt;I am convinced that, in a few years, people will look at that slump as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.&lt;/strong&gt; If you are still holding, or even better, DCAing, you&amp;#39;re gonna make it. Well, probably.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every single person that was there in 2017 told me the same thing : those who bought and hold during the brutal bear market made insane amount of money when the bull came back. And, from a long-term perspective, there is a lot of reasons to be bullish. Ethereum will finally switch to proof-of-stake in about three months, Bitcoin has been hold surprisingly well against growth/tech stocks, a lot of new protocols are being worked on/launched, Biden basically told us last week the US will regulate - but not ban - cryptocurrencies...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Could the prices get lower in the next few weeks? Absolutely. Inflation, war, recession : it&amp;#39;s possible that we drill further down. But if you hold through this tumultuous period, you will emerge on the other side wealthier.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is in moments like these that characters are forged. I hope that in ten years you can look back on this time and be proud that you stayed true to your convictions!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON
