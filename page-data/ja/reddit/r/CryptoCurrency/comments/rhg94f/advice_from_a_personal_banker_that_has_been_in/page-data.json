They began to talk and she explained she will be taking 100% of it and putting it into Bitcoin and other cryptos. Her being the client my mother-in-law could not give her opinion but instead only recommended she speak to a financial advisor and was immediately shut down saying she had already made up her mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After my mother-in-law told us this story she began to tell us how stupid this woman was and how unsafe crypto was and that it because you were not getting a physical representation of the value that it was worthless and because it was money not in a bank how it could be stolen easily by anyone that wanted to. She then told us how disappointed whoever left her the inheritance would be if they knew she would be”throwing away the money like that”. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The whole time my wife just keeps patting my lap giving me the signal to just listen and not say anything. After the whole story all I said was “that’s cool” and changed the subject. My wife was very proud that i didn’t turn it into a debate. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So anyways today she told my wife and I that she had been on the phone for a few hours because someone got into her bank account and took out a few thousand dollars and she was trying to get it sorted out. I looked her straight in the eyes and said “and here I thought that money was only safe if it was in the bank.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rhg94f/advice_from_a_personal_banker_that_has_been_in/","title":"Advice from a personal banker that has been in the banking industry for 35 years","tags":["CryptoCurrency","reddit"],"date":"December 16, 2021","dateISO":"2021-12-16T06:33:15.000Z","datetime":"2021-12-16 06:33","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"rhg94f","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rhg94f/advice_from_a_personal_banker_that_has_been_in/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rhg94f/advice_from_a_personal_banker_that_has_been_in/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"CryptoCurrency","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency","author":"Bdrake93","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Bdrake93","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Bdrake93","score":188,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"銀行業界歴35年のパーソナルバンカーからのアドバイス","the_new_excerpt":"そのため、複数の銀行を渡り歩いてきた義母は、総合的に判断して\n日曜日の夜、約35年間この業界に携わってきた私たちと夕食を共にしました。\n\n彼女は、ある女性が非常に大きな金額を預けるために銀行を訪れたことを話してくれました。\nその時、「この人、この人、この人。二人は話し始め...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"一位在银行业工作了35年的个人银行家的建议","the_new_excerpt":"我的岳母曾在多家银行工作过，但总的来说已经在这个行业工作了35年。\n业约35年，周日晚上和我们一起吃饭。\n\n她告诉我们，有一个女人来到银行，要把她刚得到的一笔遗产中的一大笔钱存入银行。\n从她刚收到的遗产中存入一大笔钱。他们开始交谈，并且...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"一位在銀行業工作了35年的個人銀行家的建議","the_new_excerpt":"我的岳母曾在多家銀行工作過，但總的來說已經在這個行業工作了35年。\n業約35年，週日晚上和我們一起喫飯。\n\n她告訴我們，有一個女人來到銀行，要把她剛得到的一筆遺產中的一大筆錢存入銀行。\n從她剛收到的遺產中存入一大筆錢。他們開始交談，並且...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-rheo2j","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/Bitcoin/comments/rheo2j/i_hope_my_bitcoin_sculpture_and_therapy_lamp/","title":"I hope my Bitcoin sculpture and therapy lamp brings people a morale boost to everyone out there.","date":"December 16, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"私のビットコイン彫刻とセラピーランプが、そこにいる人たちの士気を高めてくれることを願っています。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"我希望我的比特币雕塑和治疗灯能给外面的人带来鼓舞士气的作用。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我希望我的比特幣雕塑和治療燈能給外面的人帶來鼓舞士氣的作用。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-rh6epr","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rh6epr/csgo_empire_a_betting_platform_got_rekt_due_to/","title":"CSGO Empire, a betting platform, got rekt due to the price bug on Coinmarketcap!
