It is horrible for me to see them rise to power again today.</p>\n\n<p>My family is still in Kabul. I can tell you that cryptocurrencies would not have saved them. As soon as other countries heard of the Taliban rising, they closed all embassies so nobody could get a visum. It used to be easy to get out of the country to atleast Pakistan, India or China but they too closed their borders when the Taliban march became to &#39;real&#39;. With no passports, no visums and no money for 90% of the Afghan people, where would they go?</p>\n\n<p>As more and more provinces were being taken, more and more people were forced to go to Kabul. Most of these fugitives had fought against the taliban in their own province and were now forced to sleep in the parks, on the ground and in the parkings lots. The locals of Kabul spared them whatever food they could.......</p>\n\n<p>When the Taliban circled Kabul, hyperinflation occured. Prices of all foods skyrocketed out of fear of dying of starvation. Do you really believe cryptocurrencies could have changes this?</p>\n\n<p><strong>I think not.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Also what many people don&#39;t realise is that many in Afghanistan are UNBANKED. They only hold some cash and use it to buy stuff. Cash would be more useful in this scenario than having cryptocurrencies on some exchange or even in your wallet. What if they turn off the internet? They will surely censor a large part of the internet if not compeletly turn it off. I remember back in 2000, you weren&#39;t even allowed to listen to music, hold a wedding etc. I fear for my family but all I can do is pray.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON
