He also reported that both sweatshirts had the letters “WSB” on them with a image of a baby wearing sunglasses.</p>\n\n<p>“<em>There was literally bitcoin everywhere, it was like witnessing a real-life double-top!</em>” said Laura Latoshi, who also remarked that she saw people rush the ATM and start grabbing as much bitcoin as they could carry. “<em>If you ask me, they are just a bunch of paper-handed bitches who obviously panicked during the last market dip and sold low.</em>”</p>\n\n<p>The car — a 2021 Tesla Model S Plaid — was subsequently spotted by employees working the Joplin AMC Theatre later the same day. “<em>I guess they bought high and sold low and are looking for a way to buy some Lambos.</em>” said Frank Etherman, an AMC box office employee.</p>\n\n<p>A member of the popular subreddit, <em>CryptoCurrency</em>, estimated the theft was worth roughly $6,900,420.00.
