I learned the hard way.</p>\n\n<p>So called &quot;fundamentals&quot; (&#39;solid team&#39;, &#39;awesome project&#39;, &#39;upcoming partnerships&#39;)  don&#39;t reflect the price in a company that received its funding before it has ever proven anything (that&#39;s the primary difference between an ICO and an IPO). <strong><em>Where my REQ marines at?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>When this bull run is actually over (and personally i don&#39;t believe that it is yet), you probably won&#39;t come to accept it until your portfolio is sitting at 50% of its ATH and your &quot;stack&quot; of crypto has become a &quot;bag&quot; you&#39;re stuck holding &quot;until you reach XX number again--then you&#39;ll sell <em>for sure</em>.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s the reality: Once the bubble pops, every crash is going to seem like a &quot;dip&quot; and every &quot;bounce&quot; is going feel like a &quot;this is gentlemen.&quot;  <strong><em>That&#39;s how frogs get boiled to death.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Here are some principles you need to keep in mind if you want to walk away from this bull run with a fat stack of cash:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Recognize and accept that you won&#39;t sell the exact top, and that--subsequently--your portfolio&#39;s &quot;true value&quot; is only what you sell it for--not what it&#39;s ATH was at one point.</li>\n<li>Pick a realistic sum (take your dream figure and subtract 50%) at which you&#39;re going to cash out a certain percentage--or all of it--and (here&#39;s the important part): <strong><em>STICK TO IT.</em></strong>\n\n<ol>\n<li>This latter point is most crucial, because as the sum grows and actually hits that number you picked, you&#39;re going to be very tempted to leave it in &quot;just a little longer&quot;. That&#39;s greed talking. If you ask Greed &quot;how much is enough?&quot; the answer is always &quot;a little bit more.&quot; Have discipline in this and you&#39;ll win. Let greed take over and you&#39;ll lose. <em>If you let greed govern your decisions in a bull market, then you&#39;ll let panic govern your decisions in a bear market.</em></li>\n</ol></li>\n<li>You can&#39;t predict the future--so don&#39;t judge your past self for knowledge you have today. &quot;Why didn&#39;t i buy that coin?!?! it just mooned!&quot; Or &quot;Why didn&#39;t i sell before it crashed?!&quot; You know what happened yesterday because it&#39;s today--you can&#39;t get mad at yourself for not possessing today&#39;s knowledge on the day before yesterday.</li>\n<li>My final and <strong>MOST IMPORTANT</strong> point:\n\n<ol>\n<li>As I said before <strong><em>your portfolio is only worth what you actually sell it for</em></strong>. So do <strong>NOT</strong> focus on <strong><em>how much it was</em></strong> or <strong><em>how much it could have been</em></strong> -- if you make this mistake you will be dissatisfied at turning $1000 into $100,000. If you&#39;ve only got a $1,000 right now, you&#39;re probably thinking &quot;of course i&#39;d be happy with $100k!&quot; -- but when you get there you&#39;ll be holding out for 200/300/1 million. In your greed, you won&#39;t be satisfied with an enormous return--especially if you keep thinking about how you could have had $1,000,000 if you just &quot;bought that dip&quot; that no one saw coming or &quot;held xyz coin&quot; a little bit longer.  <strong><em>Focus on what you have today--not what you might have tomorrow.</em></strong></li>\n</ol></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Crypto veterans what other wisdom do you want to add to this list?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON
