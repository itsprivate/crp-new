It&#39;s also a young space, meaning innovation is happening on the go; London fork, Taproot, Alonzo, <em>what do all of these even mean?</em> </p>\n\n<p>Most crypto veterans place an emphasis on <em>Doing Your Own Research</em> (DYOR), but it&#39;s, as with most things, it&#39;s easier said than done. So here&#39;s a curated list of useful crypto research tools for two types of long-term hodlers: fundamental and quantitative analyzers.</p>\n\n<h1>Set it and forget it hodlers</h1>\n\n<p>As a <em>set it and forget it hodler</em> your best friend is fundamental research and crypto news. You also want to avoid the &#39;noise&#39; of the daily market to make it easier to hold. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Messari</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/o3ugjki9lvb71.png?width=2556&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2801663de7532701b308473fb1d1c33f86a7f60a\">Bitcoin research page in Messari</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://messari.io/\">Messari</a> is the king of crypto research tools. While it may look a bit intimidating at first, it makes crypto research incredibly easy once you&#39;re able to navigate the site. They have a crypto profile that shows you things like type (currency, privacy coin, smart-contract platform, etc.), consensus algorithm, inception, and a clear and concise description. They also have links to communities, white papers, codes, and research articles. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s not something you have to check all the time. It&#39;s particularly useful whenever you have to do some deep-dive research. There is a paid version but the free version suffices.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Kraken Daily Hash Newsletter</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/qz6erl44nvb71.png?width=1206&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=138324bf68393cdf0b4e184cd3b2bc9ae144fa81\">Sample of Kraken newsletter, the Daily Hash.</a></p>\n\n<p>Again, as a long-term hodler, you want to focus on the big news instead of what X billionaire has to say about crypto. You&#39;re talking regulations, milestones, and adoption. Kraken has a daily newsletter (Mondays-Fridays), the Daily Hash, that aggregates the most relevant crypto headlines. They also have research reports about market recaps and other big events once a month or so. </p>\n\n<p>You can subscribe to them <a href=\"https://www.kraken.com/en-us/subscribe/intelligence\">here</a> or visit their website. For this section, only the Daily Hash and the Research reports are recommended. I also subscribe to the OTC report but that&#39;s for more technical discussions that may or may not be suited for long-term hodling. </p>\n\n<h1>Data-oriented Investors</h1>\n\n<p>Despite crypto being an incredibly young market, there&#39;s a lot to love about crypto market data. In my opinion, the data-oriented aspect of crypto is underrated. We have tons of models and theories backed by a sufficient number of years, that make the cryptoverse a unique investing environment. For example, there&#39;s always been one long-term bull and bear market per halvening and each of them having less ROI and longer runs than the prior cycle, this follows the <em>diminishing returns</em> and <em>lengthening cycles theory</em>, respectively. So here&#39;s where you can find all the important indicators.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Altcoin Season Index</strong> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/bfz70qcdrvb71.png?width=2200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c6563a8bacc36016d67cdd91985249e92e3d2d41\">Altcoin Index Chart indicating Alt Season and Bitcoin Season</a></p>\n\n<p>One of the most important concepts to understand in the current market environment is <em>Bitcoin Dominance</em> and how this relates to the price action of alts. In summary, when Bitcoin falls, alts fall faster; when Bitcoin rises, alts rise faster. Because of this, lots of people like to move to Bitoin, a crypto &#39;safe haven&#39; during bear markets and times of uncertainty, aka <em>Bitcoin Season</em>, and move into other coins during bull markets, aka <em>Altcoin Season</em>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbmlpcW5zUW5GZ0g2dnFiRnZsQUdMN3VDQVQ0QXxBQ3Jtc0trZEZXOXU3bzhZT1p6RHVUTnRvWk8yR09mQlFyTUoxcEJPMGxkQ2NpTWN1UzVSZkdIV0p6U01MYzRmT1dNbG5SUHdxRjhReFN3cTA5WmowQ1JvZVJhQzV0VnlCRTNWWlNtb3ZrbkRiZkJWR3ZscUxDTQ&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.blockchaincenter.net%2Faltcoin-season-index%2F\">The Altcoin Season Index</a> shows you when it is an optimal time to invest in altcoins and when you might want to be in BTC. Additionally, the blockchain center is also a number of useful tools and technical indicators like the famous, <a href=\"https://www.blockchaincenter.net/bitcoin-rainbow-chart/\">Bitcoin logarithmic Rainbow</a>.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Glassnode</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/0txfekfhtvb71.png?width=1246&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2253cefca9bb580b54b50d7d489232cd986ae632\">Sample Glassnode Insights newsletter</a></p>\n\n<p>This is an on-chain market indicators site, showing data for Bitcoin and Ethereum. They have the  <a href=\"https://studio.glassnode.com/\">Studio</a>, a live on-chain data explorer with visualisations of the most fundamental on-chain metrics, Glassnode <a href=\"https://glassnode.com/metrics\">Metrics</a>, a comprehensive library of on-chain metrics, and <a href=\"https://insights.glassnode.com/\">Insights</a>, contextualized reports and analyses drawn from on-chain data.</p>\n\n<p>They also have an academy where you can learn how to read all of these metrics and data. Like Kraken Intelligence, they also have a <a href=\"https://cdn.forms-content.sg-form.com/f6bb0156-cafb-11e9-941a-e2e604f90f01\">newsletter</a> for technical discussions on major cryptocurrencies. At this point, I&#39;d also recommend subscribing to <a href=\"https://www.kraken.com/en-us/subscribe/intelligence\">Kraken&#39;s OTC newsletter</a>.</p>\n\n<h1>Bybt</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/4ivx1qz4awb71.png?width=2552&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d12253209655b802dc6a33d89904ddce31664df6\">Stock-to-Flow Model page</a></p>\n\n<p>Last but not the least is Bybt, a derivative data analytics tool typically reserved  for advanced crypto traders. They have a data section that houses all of the most relevant crypto market valuation models such as the Stock-to-Flow Model, Puell Multiple, and the Crypto Fear and Greed Index.</p>\n\n<p>But the main dish for Bybt is the derivative tools: futures &amp; options open interest, funding rates &amp; longs vs. shorts across a range of different exchanges. While I don&#39;t use this to guide my financial decisions, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mdf4la/this_is_what_happens_to_bitcoin_when_options/\">some people</a> like to make connections between the derivatives market and price action. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<h1>Bonus Tools:</h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>CoinGecko &amp; CoinMarketCap:</strong> these are the standard crypto screeners, not ideal for hodlers--can get addicting.</li>\n<li><strong>CryptoPanic</strong>: a news aggregator with sentiment scores and feedback, ideal for staying up-to-date.</li>\n<li><strong>TradingView</strong>: cloud-based charting and social networking platform, ideal for traders.</li>\n<li><strong>CoinDance</strong>: for hash rate, mining, and market volume statistics, ideal for advanced research.</li>\n<li><strong>CryptoQuant</strong>: similar statistics to <em>CoinDance.</em></li>\n<li><strong>CoinMarketCal</strong>: a calendar for all the important crypto-related events, ideal for staying up-to-date.</li>\n<li><strong>RugDoc</strong>: a tool to check the risk-level and timeline of defi projects, ideal for defi investors.</li>\n<li><strong>CryptoResearchReport:</strong> Full in-depth reports with easy-to-understand language, ideal for readers.<br/></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>That&#39;s all for now folks, lemme know if I missed anything that&#39;s useful to you.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/omnozt/a_curated_list_of_the_best_crypto_research_tools/","title":"A curated list of
