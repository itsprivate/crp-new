The world can just be an absolutely awful, awful place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I read these &amp;quot;stolen or hacked crypto&amp;quot; posts all the time. I always think, wow that person doesn&amp;#39;t know what they&amp;#39;re doing, shouldn&amp;#39;t be investing in crypto in the first place, or that would never happen to me, because I&amp;#39;m super careful! Maybe they are just lying and trying to just get sympathy? Believe me, I wish I was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although, the posts that seem legit I always try to help. Now, I am on the other side of it. Never thought I&amp;#39;d be here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been investing in digital assets since early 2016. I would consider myself pretty knowledgeable on all things related crypto/blockchain. I believe in the tech, I built my portfolio up for years and this is pretty much the only thing I enjoy in life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a hardware wallet (Ledger Nano S) since 2017 and 4 different Metamask &amp;quot;hot&amp;quot; wallets. The hardware wallet consisted of 80% of my portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I used my Metamask to access all my wallets for a balance status check before the new year. Everything seemed normal. After checking again late last night and after seeing one of my accounts showing as zero, I noticed every wallet was wiped.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My only possible conclusion is that I clicked a malicious link while surfing the internet. The trojan must have somehow took control over my Google Chrome browser (or Metamask extension) while I was using it, while my ledger was unlocked. Checking the transactions times they were sent out around the time I had it open. Again, I never was prompted to accept or approve anything that I myself wasn&amp;#39;t doing. It is frightening.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I look at all of my wallets today, I see zero balances and I am absolutely crushed. It took all my power to even get out of bed, file reports, and write this post today.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I filed a report with my local county police department and the FBI. Although, I doubt either will be of any help, unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Checking the transactions, it seems like the wallets were completed wiped in a matter of minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hacker&amp;#39;s ETH address:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;0x365DB2B5722d13F431224066898b4CF8cA7AdFe5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Address on all chains:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://blockscan.com/address/0x365DB2B5722d13F431224066898b4CF8cA7AdFe5\"&gt;https://blockscan.com/address/0x365DB2B5722d13F431224066898b4CF8cA7AdFe5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m hoping one of the wallets leads to a KYC connection, but obviously a long shot here. Super grateful for any research or help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some of the crypto that was stolen:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$ETH $MATIC $AAVE $TIME $OVR $ENS $ZRX $AVAX&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the hot wallets were all hacked, it would not be the end of the world. I just don&amp;#39;t understand how the hacker accessed my hardware wallet, too. Again, I was never prompted a transaction to approve. My seed phrase is on paper, stored in a safe, which no one has access to. My seed phrase has never been written down anywhere else, no computer, no phone, except on that paper in the safe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know since it&amp;#39;s self custody, it&amp;#39;s obviously still my fault. Aside from probably accidently clicking a malicious link on the internet somewhere, I&amp;#39;m still at a complete loss of what I could have done better. A possible solution was to maybe have the hardware wallet on a computer I never touched - one that I never used the internet for, but this is all in hindsight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been on this computer for years and there&amp;#39;s been a few times when accidently clicking something that starts an auto-download. Obviously, I am always quick to delete or disable those files. Maybe a virus file was lying dormant for months or years without my anti-virus catching it? Just waiting for the right opportunity? Maybe it is a Metamask data leak? I&amp;#39;m not sure. I like to think I&amp;#39;m pretty careful about my passwords and security.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I mainly write this post to warn others. Even if you think you are safe, you might still be at risk. I guess with these advanced hackers now, all it takes is one wrong click. This was my life savings aside from a few emergency funds in my traditional bank. I don&amp;#39;t think I will ever financially, emotionally, or mentally recover from this. It has affected my life and my family tremendously. I hate to sound dramatic and be that guy, but I&amp;#39;m honestly at a point now where life doesn&amp;#39;t even seem worth it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m trying my best to use the last of my energy to fight back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any help at all is super, super appreciated and I hope one day to pay you back tenfold (when I can).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR ledger nano s hardware wallet and Metamask hot wallets were all hacked. Did everything in my power to keep my crypto safe and still lost everything. Most likely from a miss click link -&amp;gt; file download somewhere? Not entirely sure. My life savings gone. I am absolutely crushed beyond belief. Happy new year, this is the worst day of my life.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;---  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: Many have reached out and experienced a similar hack, multiple with hardware wallets too. So many others have messaged to try to help and I can’t thank you all enough. Doing my best to respond while working with exchanges, law enforcement, etc. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I haven’t slept and working around the clock to try to bring justice to this. This is potentially huge and I don’t want others facing the same fate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can’t comment on much right now but a computer forensics expert is looking at my computer. Learned so far of a new malware that can hack into many of different crypto wallets. Yes, seems like Ledgers too. Potentially promising.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Compiling a comprehensive report when I can.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rts1w2/got_compromised_and_lost_over_120k_in_crypto_ama/","title":"Got compromised and lost over $120k in crypto; AMA","tags":["CryptoCurrency","reddit"],"date":"January 02, 2022","dateISO":"2022-01-02T17:46:28.000Z","datetime":"2022-01-02 17:46","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"rts1w2","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rts1w2/got_compromised_and_lost_over_120k_in_crypto_ama/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rts1w2/got_compromised_and_lost_over_120k_in_crypto_ama/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"CryptoCurrency","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency","author":"PowerOfTheGods","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/PowerOfTheGods","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"PowerOfTheGods","score":1849,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"暗号が漏えいし、12万ドル以上を失った; AMA","the_new_excerpt":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p> 新年一発目にここに座っているとき、私はこのように言いました。\nこの記事を書いていて思うのですが、人間はどこまで耐えられるのでしょうか。\nもう無理なのか？を、「憧れ」「憧れ」「憧れ」「憧れ」「憧れ」「憧れ」。\n</p> <p>私はこのような「盗まれた、またはハッキングされた暗号」の投稿をすべて読んでいます。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"被入侵并损失了超过12万美元的加密货币; AMA","the_new_excerpt":"<!
