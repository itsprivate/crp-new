Minority of people know anything about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Check you tube, tik tok, instagram or other social media. But not crypto channels or sites, those are pro crypto bubble, obviously most people there will like it. Check non crypto related ones that randomly mention crypto and you will regret it forever. Knowlege of average person in the internet about crypto is terrifying. Never saw so big amount of ignorance as superstition. Most people think it is fake internet money or biggest scam in history. And those people are not only boomers but millenials or gen z too. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Main argument is that it is a scam, but ofc no one can logically answer why, they act  like medieval peasants toward &amp;quot;witch&amp;quot;. No knowledge, just the same emotional repeated lies that crypto is dangerous, people lose money and my &amp;quot;favourite&amp;quot; that everyone should grow up and  work in 9-5 instead of wasting money and thinking about getting rich... Obviously anyone who invest and want to be successful is wasting time for those people. It is known internet hate any advices of making money, business or self improvement, but even most people that are seeking for bussines ideas, financial freedom and investing advices hate crypto.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is visiting those places necessary? I think yes. Too many people in crypto space don&amp;#39;t understand real situation and are too optimistic. Some truth will be refreshing  like bucket of ice on their head. Instead of only spending time  in crypto subs or channels you will see reality. Here everything is about crypto, outside not. And even if is usually not friendly at all. I tell it not to complain, get angry or be sad. But to simply understand &amp;quot;the enemy&amp;quot; and stop being ignorant. Nothing better in politics, music or business than meating people that dislike you. To much compliments lead to delusions. Reality check make you improve and become more experienced.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/u9bwuz/average_internet_user_is_still_strongly_against/","title":"Average internet user is still strongly against crypto.
