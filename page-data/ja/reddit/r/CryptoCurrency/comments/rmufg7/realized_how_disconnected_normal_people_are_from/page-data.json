Let&amp;#39;s say that I went to a job &amp;quot;preparation course&amp;quot;. I don&amp;#39;t want to reveal anything else, so let&amp;#39;s stick with that. In there I was basically locked in with my co-workers for hours and hours straight, while having classes and things like that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of a sudden, while we are on a break, I start hearing people chatting about crypto, all started with someone saying &amp;quot;Ah better to invest in DogeCoin, I heard that it&amp;#39;s hot right now&amp;quot;, I continued to listen as I had nothing better to do. &amp;quot;Yes...&amp;quot; - Replied and continued another guy &amp;quot;... I&amp;#39;ve seen that I guy bought a pizza for eleven thousand BTC and now it&amp;#39;s worth Millions&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was a shock to me. Not the fact that they were talking about crypto, but that they are SO BEHIND in terms of news about crypto, they were basically lagging 5 to 7 months in time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that is the reality as it seems (I live in Portugal), I joined the conversation, whitout revealing that I&amp;#39;m invested in it myself. As soon as I tried to generally describe how crypto works, they were astonished. There are Stores that accept crypto? What? Impossible. A Country accepts it as legal tender? No way. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stopped talking about after a bit, as I don&amp;#39;t want anyone to know that I invest in crypto at all, but in the time that I did, I understood that we are still far from general adoption. I think the fact that we spend so much time researching crypto, makes us forget that other people have no time at all to do the same, so the only information that they get are recycled news.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rmufg7/realized_how_disconnected_normal_people_are_from/","title":"Realized how disconnected \"normal\" people are from crypto","tags":["CryptoCurrency","reddit"],"date":"December 23, 2021","dateISO":"2021-12-23T14:31:57.000Z","datetime":"2021-12-23 14:31","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"rmufg7","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rmufg7/realized_how_disconnected_normal_people_are_from/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rmufg7/realized_how_disconnected_normal_people_are_from/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"CryptoCurrency","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency","author":"yaroslavwwe","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/yaroslavwwe","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"yaroslavwwe","score":322,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"普通の人」が暗号からいかに切り離されているかを実感した。","the_new_excerpt":"2週間前、私の人生は劇的に変わりました。例えば、私がある仕事に行ったとします。\n\"準備コース \"です。これ以上は明かせないので、この辺にしておこう。\nということです。そこでは、基本的に何時間も同僚と一緒に閉じ込められていました。\n授業とか受けながら、ずっと。\n\nそして...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"意识到 \"正常 \"人与加密货币的联系是多么的疏远","the_new_excerpt":"两周前，我的生活发生了翻天覆地的变化。比方说，我去参加了一个工作\n\"准备课程\"。我不想透露其他事情，所以让我们坚持说\n这一点。在那里，我基本上和我的同事们关在一起，连续几个小时\n连续几个小时，同时还要上课和做类似的事情。\n\n突然间...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"意識到 \"正常 \"人與加密貨幣的聯繫是多麼的疏遠","the_new_excerpt":"兩週前，我的生活發生了翻天覆地的變化。比方說，我去參加了一個工作\n\"準備課程\"。我不想透露其他事情，所以讓我們堅持說\n這一點。在那裏，我基本上和我的同事們關在一起，連續幾個小時\n連續幾個小時，同時還要上課和做類似的事情。\n\n突然間...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-reddit-placeholder-1","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/dankmemes/comments/kc0vb6/i_tried_my_best/","title":"I tried my best","date":"January 01, 1970","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"我尽力了","the_new_excerpt":"test","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我盡力了","the_new_excerpt":"test","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-rmsgl5","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rmsgl5/if_you_dont_think_we_are_still_very_early_just/","title":"If you dont think we are still very early, just see the reaction to crypto on a r/soccer thread -
