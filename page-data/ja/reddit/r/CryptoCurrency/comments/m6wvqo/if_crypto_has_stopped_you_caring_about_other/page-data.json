Your salary suddenly seems inconsequential and other investments are boring as hell.</p>\n\n<p>We often talk about not putting all your money into crypto, but there&#39;s another element to this too - you shouldn&#39;t dedicate all your mental energy to crypto either.</p>\n\n<p>When the next bear market comes, and it will come at some point, having nothing in your life except crypto and your portfolio app is going to make for a very depressing period.</p>\n\n<p>Even if you&#39;re making paper profits of 10k a day, you still need to develop other areas of your life - whether that&#39;s career, relationships, new business ventures etc - because everyone needs something to fall back on, both financially AND mentally.</p>\n\n<p>I run a small SaaS platform in my spare time, and it generates very little money in the grand scheme of things. But it&#39;s mine and I enjoy developing it and getting new customers. If the crypto market was to tank tomorrow, I&#39;d still have this, and that would mean a lot to me. </p>\n\n<p>Equally, I also have my normal job, and whilst it can be a bit dull at times (and in recent months almost a bit pointless!) it is still something I have continued to strive at, and it&#39;s another form of personal development that can open future financial doors.</p>\n\n<p>This is essentially a post about eggs and baskets, but just wanted to point out that the metaphor is more than just financial - it&#39;s also about your wider mindset and not letting other areas of your life slide.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/m6wvqo/if_crypto_has_stopped_you_caring_about_other/","title":"If crypto has stopped you caring about other elements of your
