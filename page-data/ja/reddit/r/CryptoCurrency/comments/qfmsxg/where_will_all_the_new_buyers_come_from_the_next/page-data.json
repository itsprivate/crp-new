From the birth of BTC, their activity has been both the shining beacon of progress and the death knell of regulation for decentralized currencies.</p>\n\n<p>But <strong>there is another continent brimming with 12x growth in adoption</strong> this past year as well as with <strong>$100B in cryptocurrency capital flowing in.</strong></p>\n\n<p>One that desperately needs cryptocurrency unlike any other modernized region, and has seemingly gone all in to buy the dip and catch up with the rest of the global economy.</p>\n\n<p>That’s right, even Forbes knows, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/oluwaseunadeyanju/2021/09/14/bitcoin-opportunity-africa-adoption-rate-is-highest-globally/\">Africa is going to be an absolutely major player in the upcoming cryptocurrency pump</a>, and those of you who pick this trend up will be the next group of adopters we look back on as clairvoyant.</p>\n\n<p>With <strong>grassroots adoption 33% higher than global average, P2P transactions the highest globally in terms of rate usage,</strong> Africa has set the stage to be <em>early</em> to the burgeoning reality of future finance.</p>\n\n<p>Why is this the case? Because local currencies are volatile, banking institutions hold less power, and Africa has long faced a crisis of the unbanked.</p>\n\n<p>Innovation isn’t just a desire, it’s a necessity out there, which is why you should expect <strong>human ingenuity under dire circumstances</strong> to create the conditions necessary for this massive pump in African cryptocurrency usage to continue.</p>\n\n<p>With this, I’d <strong>look for major assets that are investing into this new wave as well as newer assets with good backing entering the space.</strong> ADA has lagged behind in recent months, but their strategy of investing into Africa already paid major dividends earlier in the year and I imagine they will continue to expand those operations when they’re finished dealing with their developmental issues.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.afrostar.io/\"><strong>Afrostar</strong> is a new cryptocurrency <strong>launching tomorrow</strong></a>, led by CEO Darren Winters who has serious investment backing already <strong>raising $500,000 for marketing and development!</strong> Leading a cadre of big money players and a six-digit following, the Afrostar team is looking to <strong>create financial infrastructure to support the 1.2B population of Africa.</strong></p>\n\n<p>If Afrostar represents the first step in <strong>bringing an exchange built for Africans, who circumstantially rely heavily on P2P transactions</strong>, watch out. That could be a major catalyst for the evolving cryptocurrency market in the continent, which would be a major slice of this cake to Winters and his investors.</p>\n\n<p>If this all seems to be too far fetched for you, I can understand that. Previous biases are what’s preventing most people from buying into this movement. But understand that when most people are zigging, it’s a good time to zag. <strong>Being early here could be the next big win that no one is talking about</strong>. </p>\n\n<p>It’s only up to you whether that juice is worth the squeeze.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qfmsxg/where_will_all_the_new_buyers_come_from_the_next/","title":"Where will all the new buyers come from?
