Let me explain:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There have been three different Bitcoin symbols in use since its inception. The original one was designed by Satoshi and looked &lt;a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/Bitcoin_old.png\"&gt;like this&lt;/a&gt; - a picture made out of a few pixels, depicting a gold coin with &amp;quot;BC&amp;quot; on it, looking really, really awful. I think it&amp;#39;s pretty interesting that Satoshi himself designed the logo as a gold coin, as I&amp;#39;ve seen many people complain over the years if the media illustrate stories about crypto with physical coins with crypto logos on them, because that&amp;#39;s a wrong depiction. I always thought that was weird criticism - it&amp;#39;s difficult to illustrate crypto stories, are they supposed to print a picture of code if they need a picture? - but it&amp;#39;s interesting that Satoshi himself used a physical coin as a logo.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The second design was also by Satoshi and was presented on the Bitcointalk forum &lt;a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20130524055823/https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=64.0\"&gt;on February 24, 2010&lt;/a&gt; (archived version because the pictures don&amp;#39;t work with the current one). It&amp;#39;s closer to the current one, still a gold coin, but with the ₿ on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The third and final design, the white ₿ on orange background, was presented about 8 months later, on &lt;a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20130525203057/https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1631.0;all\"&gt;November 1, 2010&lt;/a&gt; (again, archived version for the same reason as above) on Bitcointalk - by Bitboy. Okay, not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; Bitboy, but a forum user with that name on Bitcointalk. Seemingly a pretty random user that only made a few posts on the forum. Crazy to think that the logo of a trillion-dollar-asset was not designed by a graphic designer but by a random guy on a forum. He said he was inspired by the Mastercard logo. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think the current logo still looks quite good almost 12 years later, and I&amp;#39;m glad we didn&amp;#39;t stick with the Satoshi logos!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/td6dn2/til_that_the_original_bitcoin_logo_was_designed/","title":"TIL that the original Bitcoin logo was designed by Satoshi himself and was incredibly ugly - and that the current logo was created by Bitboy","tags":["CryptoCurrency","reddit"],"date":"March 13, 2022","dateISO":"2022-03-13T19:37:47.000Z","datetime":"2022-03-13 19:37","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"td6dn2","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/td6dn2/til_that_the_original_bitcoin_logo_was_designed/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/td6dn2/til_that_the_original_bitcoin_logo_was_designed/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"CryptoCurrency","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency","author":"mic_droo","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/mic_droo","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"mic_droo","score":327,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"オリジナルのBitcoinのロゴはサトシ自身がデザインしたもので、信じられないほど醜いものだったということ、そして現在のロゴはBitboyが作成したものだということをTIL","the_new_excerpt":"さて、タイトルの後半は若干のクリックベイト（でも事実）です。では\nを説明します。\n\nビットコインのシンボルは、設立当初から3種類使用されています。最初の\nオリジナルのものはサトシがデザインしたもので、以下のようなものです。\n[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/Bitcoin_old.png] -...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"我不知道最初的比特币标志是由中本聪自己设计的，而且非常丑陋，而现在的标志是由Bitboy创造的。","the_new_excerpt":"好吧，标题的后半部分是轻微的点击率（但真实）。让我\n解释一下。\n\n自比特币诞生以来，已经有三种不同的比特币符号在使用。最初的\n最初的符号是由中本聪设计的，看起来像这样\n[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/Bitcoin_old.png] -...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我不知道最初的比特幣標誌是由中本聰自己設計的，而且非常醜陋，而現在的標誌是由Bitboy創造的。","the_new_excerpt":"好吧，標題的後半部分是輕微的點擊率（但真實）。讓我\n解釋一下。\n\n自比特幣誕生以來，已經有三種不同的比特幣符號在使用。最初的\n最初的符號是由中本聰設計的，看起來像這樣\n[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/Bitcoin_old.png] -...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-reddit-placeholder-1","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/dankmemes/comments/kc0vb6/i_tried_my_best/","title":"I tried my best","date":"January 01, 1970","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"我尽力了","the_new_excerpt":"test","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我盡力了","the_new_excerpt":"test","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-td67q2","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/Bitcoin/comments/td67q2/no_to_proof_of_work_ban_in_the_eu_i_just_wrote_an/","title":"No to Proof of Work Ban in the EU.
