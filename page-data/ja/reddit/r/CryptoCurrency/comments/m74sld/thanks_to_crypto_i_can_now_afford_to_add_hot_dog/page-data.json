Those were the days!  The summer of 2017 was popping and thanks to my gains, I went from eating ramen straight out of the pack to using boiled water to soften the noodles.  Before my 2017 gains, my wife&#39;s boyfriend gained a lot of respect for me, and he even called me &quot;brah&quot; one day as he was picking up my wife for a hot date.  Man, I was on top of the world!</p>\n\n<p>Fast forward to 2018, all my gains was gone.  Poof.  Overnight, I was back to eating ramen straight out of the pack.  I couldn&#39;t even afford the flavored ramen, just plain dry ramen with a generic label.  No brand names for me.  My wife&#39;s boyfriend went back to calling me Skid Mark instead of Regular Mark, and he never said &quot;brah&quot; to me ever again.  I was a loser.</p>\n\n<p>The bear market was rough.  The crypto winter seemed like it would never end.  But I was diamond hands!  I hodled my coins and waited patiently.  Then, it happened!  The crypto winter was over and the bulls were back!  Life handed me a second chance!  My wife&#39;s boyfriend is back to calling me Regular Mark, and I think he&#39;s gonna call me &quot;brah&quot; again one day.  I can&#39;t believe how lucky I am!</p>\n\n<p>To celebrate, I bought a pack of hot dogs and put hot dog slices in my ramen!  I still buy the non-flavored ramen cuz I want to save up and one day own a whole Satoshi.  But I believe in my dream!  And now my ramen tastes like boiled hot dog water, and I&#39;m happier than I&#39;ve ever been!</p>\n\n<p>Just remember, if you believe in yourself and you hodl, you can achieve anything!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/m74sld/thanks_to_crypto_i_can_now_afford_to_add_hot_dog/","title":"Thanks to crypto, I can now afford to add hot dog slices to my ramen noodles","tags":["CryptoCurrency","reddit"],"date":"March 17, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-17T19:31:03.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-17 19:31","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"m74sld","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/m74sld/thanks_to_crypto_i_can_now_afford_to_add_hot_dog/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/m74sld/thanks_to_crypto_i_can_now_afford_to_add_hot_dog/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"CryptoCurrency","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency","author":"maksidaa","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/maksidaa","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"maksidaa","score":5728,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"多亏了加密技术，我现在可以在拉面里加热狗片了。","the_new_excerpt":"伙计们，我只想发这篇拙劣的吹嘘，鼓励所有的无名小卒。\n认为只要你用心，一切皆有可能!\n\n我从2017年开始买OMG和ANT（在它变成NEO之前）。这些都是\n的日子!
