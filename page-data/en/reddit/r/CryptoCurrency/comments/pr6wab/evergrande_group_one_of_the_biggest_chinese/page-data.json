This could very well spread to markets in US and EU as well as the rest of the Asia.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<h1>What exactly is Evergrande?</h1>\n\n<p>Evergrande has a position everywhere. Its main business is  real estate, and it’s China’s second-largest property developer by sales.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>They own more than 1,300 real estate projects in over 280 cities </li>\n<li>Its property services management arm is involved in nearly 2,800 projects across more than 310 cities in China.</li>\n<li>The company has seven units dabbling in a wide range of industries, including electric vehicles, health-care services, consumer products, video and television production units and even a theme park.</li>\n<li>The firm says it has 200,000 employees, but indirectly creates more than 3.8 million jobs every year, according to its website.</li>\n<li>Evergrande’s shares and bonds are included in indexes across whole Asia.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<h2>Who will be affected the most if it comes crashing down?</h2>\n\n<p>The pool of affected parties will include banks, suppliers, home-buyers, investors, retail. Evergrande warned this week its escalating troubles could lead to even broader default risks.</p>\n\n<p>If the Evergrande can’t repay its debt, it could lead to a situation of “cross default” — where a default triggered in one situation may spread to other obligations, leading to broader contagion.</p>\n\n<p>And currently, they are unable to repay the debt due to the size of it.</p>\n\n<p>The banking industry will be among the first to be hit and they will be hit hard. And once the banks are hit it is only a matter of time when it comes to crypto.</p>\n\n<p>Evergrande’s debt crisis may snowball down the road, and economic growth will not mitigate financial losses as was the case in the past. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<h1>Should we fear?</h1>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t know but unfortunately China has a pretty big influence on markets even here in EU as also in US. If Evergrande comes crashing down, it could send ripples across markets which could cause a drastic change in crypto. Being vigilant is our best option right now.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pr6wab/evergrande_group_one_of_the_biggest_chinese/","title":"Evergrande Group, one of
