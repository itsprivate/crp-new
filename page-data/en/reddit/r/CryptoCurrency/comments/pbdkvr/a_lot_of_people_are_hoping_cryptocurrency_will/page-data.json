They evolved into the religious ruling class and eventually into the privately owned and government subsidized businesses you see today.</p>\n\n<p>And they&#39;re doing awesome.

After all, why wouldn&#39;t they? They have all the funds in the world (Yours) to play with. Everyone who isn&#39;t a crypto nerd like us has money in a bank somewhere, and it is earning banks mindboggling record blowing profits quarter after quarter. Monopolies on people&#39;s money is great - If you&#39;re a bank.</p>\n\n<p>So, this is where Crypto comes in. Giving people an alternative revenue stream, a choice. Somewhere else to put your money, and if you&#39;re smart and savvy, a way to <em>permanently manage your money by yourself</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Banks <em>hate</em> this. Why wouldn&#39;t they? It directly impacts their business, influences their massive monopoly, and hurts their profit margins.</p>\n\n<p>The real power of Cryptocurrency and decentralized finance is <em>not to tear down the traditional banking structure</em>.</p>\n\n<p>It is to <strong>force banks and traditional financial systems to adapt and become competitive with a changing market</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Every time you see a bank, credit union, or big name that previously &quot;hated&quot; Bitcoin offering it to their clients, know that you&#39;re a part of that change. When wire transfer amounts go down, you&#39;re part of that change. When you notice banks changing their fee structures, or interest rates, you&#39;re part of that change. </p>\n\n<p>You&#39;re helping banks move out of the dark ages, breaking down a monopoly, and gaining not only financial freedom, but financial wisdom too, which is way more important.</p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t worry about the banks. They&#39;re going to be there, doing their thing. There are always going to be people who need a bank, whether it is trust, reliance, or just fear of things going wrong. That&#39;s fine.</p>\n\n<p>Every time you take money out of your bank to invest in crypto, you&#39;re making people in the financial system think - <em>&quot;Why isn&#39;t this money staying with us, and what can we do to keep it?&quot;</em> No matter what, this benefits us all.</p>\n\n<p>A competitive and evolving financial system benefits us all.  Don&#39;t worry about the banks, build your own future. They&#39;ll follow suit.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pbdkvr/a_lot_of_people_are_hoping_cryptocurrency_will/","title":"A lot of people are hoping Cryptocurrency will \"kill\" banks.
