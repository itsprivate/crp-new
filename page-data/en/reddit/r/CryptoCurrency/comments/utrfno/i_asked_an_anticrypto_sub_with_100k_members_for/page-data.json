You guys are so fucking obnoxious I can&amp;#39;t stand you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.&lt;/strong&gt; Simply put, crypto is nothing. It offers nothing. provides nothing. it is people speculating on the value of nothing being worth something but in the end it’s.nothing.  if you held a jar of a hobos dick cheese in your hand, you have something more intrinsically valuable than any amount of crypto. at least you have a jar which has its uses. For a bunch of people who think this is the mega game changer, they sure are spending a lot of time online, advertising money, and paid celebrities to try to convince us how amazing it is. Yet I don’t see the mass adoption 13 years later&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5.&lt;/strong&gt; What interest rate would you charge for a 30 year mortgage lent out in any non-stablecoin of your choice (because at best, stablecoins are only meant to mirror their pegged currency)? If you can&amp;#39;t give me an interest rate that approaches rates used today, then your currency will never (and &lt;strong&gt;can&amp;#39;t&lt;/strong&gt; ever) be adopted as a true currency. If you&amp;#39;re just using it to gamble, then gamble away. Just don&amp;#39;t make any allusions about a possible future of actual adoption.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6.&lt;/strong&gt; There would be no bitcoin in the madman future someone is preparing for. Unfortunately that&amp;#39;s against and old argument for crypto. They keep changing their &amp;#39;purpose&amp;#39; usually it contradicts itself and there is a new &amp;#39;purpose&amp;#39; everyday.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7.&lt;/strong&gt; Volatility makes it useless. If I gave you $100 in BTC and it tanks in a day, I did well and you did not. Or the opposite and it goes up. Someone always loses in the transaction. It’s up and down so much even a few percent in a matter of hours. Sure that’s not a big deal for $20-$50 but it is if we’re talking thousands. My “fiat” doesn’t change that much that quick.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8.&lt;/strong&gt; Because it&amp;#39;s a negative sum Ponzi/pyramid hybrid scheme that has absolutely no real world value.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s just like fiat cash, only way less secure, far less convenient, and with unbelievable teller fees.It’s a solution in search of a problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10.&lt;/strong&gt; My top argument is Crypto is reinventing what we already have. Fractional reserve banking = stablecoin. Fast transactions (lightning) = Visa. Distributed ledger = database  Exchanges = banks. Carbon converted to CO2 en masse = mining.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/utrfno/i_asked_an_anticrypto_sub_with_100k_members_for/","title":"I asked an Anti-Crypto Sub with 100k members for their top arguments against Bitcoin and this was the 10 best they could come up with.","tags":["CryptoCurrency","reddit"],"date":"May 20, 2022","dateISO":"2022-05-20T16:30:42.000Z","datetime":"2022-05-20 16:30","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"utrfno","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/utrfno/i_asked_an_anticrypto_sub_with_100k_members_for/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/utrfno/i_asked_an_anticrypto_sub_with_100k_members_for/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"CryptoCurrency","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency","author":"jam-hay","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/jam-hay","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"jam-hay","score":313,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"100kの会員を持つAnti-Crypto Subにビットコインに対する反論のトップ10を尋ねたところ、これが彼らが考え出したベスト10だった。","the_new_excerpt":"> 1.取引所の存在により、ビットコインの中核的な主張が完全に無意味になった。\n> 無関係にした。\n> \n> 2.ビットコインはせいぜいオモチャだ。\n> 詐欺にあった人々、環境、ランサムウェアの犠牲者など、数え上げればきりがない。\n> 今現在、100万人の暗号兄弟が...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"我问一个拥有10万会员的反加密货币子组织，他们反对比特币的首要论据是什么，这是他们能想出的10个最好的论据。","the_new_excerpt":"> 1.交易所的存在使比特币的核心主张变得完全\n> 无关紧要。\n> \n> 2.它充其量只是一个玩具，实际上它是一个巨大的灾难。\n> 对环境、对勒索软件的受害者。\n> 现在有一百万加密货币兄弟正在...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我問一個擁有10萬會員的反加密貨幣子組織，他們反對比特幣的首要論據是什麼，這是他們能想出的10個最好的論據。","the_new_excerpt":"> 1.交易所的存在使比特幣的核心主張變得完全\n> 無關緊要。\n> \n> 2.它充其量只是一個玩具，實際上它是一個巨大的災難。\n> 對環境、對勒索軟件的受害者。\n> 現在有一百萬加密貨幣兄弟正在...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-reddit-placeholder-1","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/dankmemes/comments/kc0vb6/i_tried_my_best/","title":"I tried my best","date":"January 01, 1970","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"我尽力了","the_new_excerpt":"test","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我盡力了","the_new_excerpt":"test","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-utuf9d","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/Bitcoin/comments/utuf9d/michael_saylor_lets_go_back_to_october_of_2020_i/","title":"Michael Saylor: \"Let's go back to October of 2020 ...
