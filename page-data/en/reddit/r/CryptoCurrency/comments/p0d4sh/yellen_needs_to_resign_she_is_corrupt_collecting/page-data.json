Because if the laws pass, it will give her the power to regulate the entire crypto industry. Yellen is the person behind White House&#39;s push to favor Sen. Warner&#39;s amendment over others. While the entire crypto community has been publicly tying to educate Senators on these laws, she has been making calls behind closed doors trying to arm twist the Senators into bringing in these draconian regulations. &quot;Shadowy&quot;</p>\n\n<p>As it turns out she has also been getting paid by the banks she is supposed to regulate. And she is brining in regulation that kills decentralised competitors to banks, who have so far enjoyed near monopoly when it comes to controlling people&#39;s finances. </p>\n\n<p>As Treasury Secretary, she is paid by the US Government to regulate banks - a role that requires the highest standards of ethics and moral turpitude. But she has collected $7m from the same banks that she regulates! Including Citi, Citadel Securities etc. How, without impartiality, can she regulate these banks that are paying her millions of dollars in speaking fees? </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/xffdoivz7zf71.jpg?width=952&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=45e1e13fd61e6313fb748fed2beaa006ccad9d09\">All the payments she received in 2020. All from home, due to lockdown. Collecting millions from the entities she regulates. </a></p>\n\n<p>Imo - public officials paid by the government should not be collecting millions from the same entities they regulate. This is nothing but grift. While it is not per se criminal, because she was doing it when she was not a Govt official, but nevertheless these payments were received between her 2 terms as Treasury Secretary. </p>\n\n<p>The ethical thing for her was to not accept the role of Treasury Secretary in the new Biden Administration, because she was aware she had been paid by the banks she is supposed to regulate. But despite all this, she took up the job. clearly indicating her lack of morals and ethics. </p>\n\n<p>She really needs to STEP DOWN. The crypto community must unite to get such greedy grifters out of public policy for good, if we need to have a fair chance at our decentralised future.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p0d4sh/yellen_needs_to_resign_she_is_corrupt_collecting/","title":"Yellen needs to resign.
