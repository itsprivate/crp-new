Others believe that we are early. I believe that both of those answers are wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: No we are not early so much that $1000 in BTC will make you rich. But also you are not late to the party.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin exist since 2009.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin first transaction happened in May 2010, 16 months after its creation. We are talking about Bitcoin when its price was less then a cent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right now, I still don&amp;#39;t see a massige global adoption, but I believe that it is coming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Crypto is a young space, vast majority of crypto coins in top100 are less then five years old.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This kind of investment is a little bit hard to understand for a lot of people, that is why maybe we don&amp;#39;t see growth as much as we hope. Or we are just expecting too much way too fast. Crypto is complicated and we can all agree on that. So were other technologies in the begining.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Advanced technologies like &lt;strong&gt;internet&lt;/strong&gt; are good example. Internet was invented in 1983.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 1993 we had around 14 million users of internet worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 1994 we had around 25 million users worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 1995 we had around 44 million users worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I said worldwide? Actually, most of these users were from America btw.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those are low numbers considering what we have today almost 5 billion users (at least devices) on internet. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This also shows that often it takes many years for people to start adopting new technologies. You know, back in the days there was no web browsers. To start using internet you had to type commands on some ugly black and white, or green screen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today, we have more then 300 million people that used or are still using crypto in some way, while 18,000 business are accepting them as a form of payment - &lt;a href=\"https://triple-a.io/crypto-ownership/\"&gt;Source.&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;According to data acquired by Finbold, about 10.2 percent of the global population using the internet owns some form of cryptocurrency - &lt;a href=\"https://www.theportugalnews.com/news/2022-02-14/10-of-the-global-population-owns-cryptocurrency/65227\"&gt;news source&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So basically, crypto users are growing globally fast. Maybe just not fast as you would like to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Take a look at this chart I found on the web, it shows that the crypto has the fastest rate of adoption compared to other technologies in our world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/mm0inikgdss81.png?width=934&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=bf750bc5d5b99e92aff724a207e092a1fc6d2e95\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/mm0inikgdss81.png?width=934&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=bf750bc5d5b99e92aff724a207e092a1fc6d2e95&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The way I see it, people are talking it is &amp;quot;too late&amp;quot; because they don&amp;#39;t believe that they will see massive gains if they invest $1000 in BTC. Well, you probably won&amp;#39;t get rich with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Adopting a new technology is not a walk in the park, that is why a lot of us here says &amp;quot;be patient&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is more then 16,000 cryptocurrencies today, and if we take a look at 2017 we will see that a lot of them went really down, or really dead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It probably is going to happen again with a lot of cryptocurrencies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It will take time, but the way I see it, you are not late, crypto is yet to come, and I don&amp;#39;t really think that this can be stopped.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you start investing today you are still early, but not too early. You are 100% not late.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/u0u81h/of_course_you_are_not_late_if_you_start_investing/","title":"Of course you are not late if you start investing today.","tags":["CryptoCurrency","reddit"],"date":"April 11, 2022","dateISO":"2022-04-11T12:57:08.000Z","datetime":"2022-04-11 12:57","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"u0u81h","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/u0u81h/of_course_you_are_not_late_if_you_start_investing/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/u0u81h/of_course_you_are_not_late_if_you_start_investing/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"CryptoCurrency","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency","author":"UnexperiencedIT","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/UnexperiencedIT","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"UnexperiencedIT","score":333,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"もちろん、今日から投資を始めても遅くはありません。","the_new_excerpt":"遅れているという意見もあります。私たちが早く来たと信じている人もいます I\nどちらも間違いだと思います。\n\nTLDR：いいえ、私たちはBTCで1000ドルあれば金持ちになれるというほど早くはありません。しかし、同時に\nパーティに遅れることはない。\n\nビットコインは2009年から存在しています。\n\nビットコインの最初の取引は...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"当然，如果你今天开始投资，你也不会迟到。","the_new_excerpt":"有些人认为，我们已经迟到了。其他人则认为我们早到了。I\n我相信这两个答案都是错的。\n\nTLDR：不，我们并不早，以至于1000美元的BTC会让你发财。但同时\n你并没有迟到。\n\n比特币从2009年就存在了。\n\n比特币的第一笔交易发生在2008年。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"當然，如果你今天開始投資，你也不會遲到。","the_new_excerpt":"有些人認爲，我們已經遲到了。其他人則認爲我們早到了。I\n我相信這兩個答案都是錯的。\n\nTLDR：不，我們並不早，以至於1000美元的BTC會讓你發財。但同時\n你並沒有遲到。\n\n比特幣從2009年就存在了。\n\n比特幣的第一筆交易發生在2008年。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-reddit-placeholder-1","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/dankmemes/comments/kc0vb6/i_tried_my_best/","title":"I tried my best","date":"January 01, 1970","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"我尽力了","the_new_excerpt":"test","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我盡力了","the_new_excerpt":"test","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-u14qd0","excerpt":"Max Keiser has repeated his cringe fest from 2021 where he shreds USD notes for\nhis audience to make his point that fiat is worthless.
