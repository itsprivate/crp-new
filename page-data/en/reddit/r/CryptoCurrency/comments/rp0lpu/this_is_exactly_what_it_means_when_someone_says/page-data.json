So  there is no  central company, or other body, exerting ownership and,  with it, responsibility. Anyone can build on this platform and engage  the  community. This is one of its superpowers. Yet because anyone can  build  DApps, users need to be judicious. As the saying goes, ‘Do your  own  research’.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Researching means  more than scrolling through search  results or watching your favorite  YouTuber talk about moonshots or chart  patterns. By doing your own due  diligence and taking your signal from  the right community voices (amid  the noise), you can give yourself the  best chance of navigating the  emergent landscape successfully. And with  it, play your part in helping  grow a safe, secure, and healthy  ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However,  decentralization doesn’t mean we should accept a ‘wild  west’  environment. Even with the noblest intentions, some DApps will  include  design flaws, have bugs, or be poorly supported by inexperienced  devs.  These issues could leave low-quality DApps more open to being  hacked.  There will even be DApps that are outright scams or rug pulls.  Sadly  this is inevitable at some point. And of course, the detractors  will  seize on these issues and seek to amplify them to damage the community.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It  is the responsibility of each DApp developer to  ensure that their  application produces the correct results. Meanwhile,  every responsible  member of the community should do their own research  and help educate  others. In the end, it is up to individual users to  protect themselves  from bad actors. So be curious, even skeptical. Ask  questions. Accept  nothing at face value. Equally, be cautious in calling  out scams - with  so much FUD about, you should not add to the noise  without due  deliberation. And many of us will remember this &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boy_Who_Cried_Wolf\"&gt;cautionary tale&lt;/a&gt; from our childhoods…&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A fact checklist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who are the developers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Developers  proud of their product will be easy to contact and responsive to   questions. There should be a project website. Anonymity or pseudonymity  is  relatively common in crypto, but it is important to know the  developer  can be traced if money is involved. It is much easier for  anonymous  developers to disappear with your funds. Even if fully  doxxed, is this  the developer’s first project? Devs or code shops with a  reputation have  more to lose, while inexperienced developers are more  likely to make  mistakes or take shortcuts, especially if there is a  rush to launch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the project’s vision?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do   your best to ensure that the project’s values and actions align with   your values. Look at decentralization, idealism, passion, and purpose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FOMO is your enemy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If   it’s a great application now, it will be a great application next week   and next month. If the developer plays on your fear of missing out,  that  is a big red flag. Due diligence takes time. Be diligent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is it really, really good?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The   old saying applies. If it’s too good to be true, it probably is. If  the  project offers higher than normal staking rewards, you need to be   hyper-vigilant and very thorough in your investigation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Celebrity endorsements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Endorsements  can be bought, and they are often an essential ingredient of a pump and  dump or rug pull. By design, retail investors first discover a dump or  rug pull when their basket of tokens is suddenly worthless. Don’t put  your trust in YouTubers, but take note of YouTubers you trust.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is the product open source?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not   all trustworthy DApps need to be open source. However, if the product   claims to be open source, you should check the claim. For example, the   GitHub repository should be accessible and active.  The names of people  on GitHub should match at least some of the people  on the project  website.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project documentation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There may be a white paper, lite paper, or other design documentation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Perform   a thorough fact check: check sources, investigate authors, ensure   content is authentic and not plagiarized. Evidence of poor proofreading,   missing content, or broken links in references should all raise   concerns. If the white paper is on a ‘pay to publish’ site, you should   take that into consideration.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Token distribution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If  the project has an  associated token, use a chain analysis tool to  check for a  concentration of token ownership. For example, it would  raise concern if  most of the project&amp;#39;s tokens were allocated to a  handful of wallets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is it a new project, or is it ported from another chain?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Check  its reputation in its past life, if it had one. It still takes good  developers to take full advantage of the platform.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it is a new project, how new is it? Do the participants have any history in the crypto space?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is the developer engaged on social media?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Look  for an active community of users and reviewers.  Look to see how  recently the entities associated with the project were created. Be  suspicious of new accounts with only a few tweets. Check the number of  followers, too. Tools like Sparktoro are another way you can check real v  fake followers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much testing has been done?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We  would  expect a good project to have been active on the testnet – and  offering  commentary in social channels – before its mainnet launch.  Promoting the testnet launch through social media to allow  end-users to  test and build their understanding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Has an external audit been conducted?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Look for a respected organization that is independent of the developer. See below for some useful organizations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review the product against your requirements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No   matter how good the product, it must be right for you. If you are   looking to earn extra ada rewards or trade, it remains forever true –   never risk more than you can afford to lose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some useful organizations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;External   organizations can help you learn more about the developer of the DApp.   Also, DApp developers can enlist external companies to help with the   development process.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;More information about developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Check the &lt;a href=\"https://research.binance.com/en/projects\"&gt;Binance Project Reports&lt;/a&gt; page.

Supporting great DApps will nourish a population of honest,   trustworthy developers. Together, we will reach our goal of becoming a   flourishing, self-governing community.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=\"https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/12/09/when-it-comes-to-defi-do-your-own-research/\"&gt;https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/12/09/when-it-comes-to-defi-do-your-own-research/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rp0lpu/this_is_exactly_what_it_means_when_someone_says/","title":"THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT IT MEANS when someone says TO DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH (DYOR): a guide on HOW TO BE SMARTER THAN THE SCAMMERS!
