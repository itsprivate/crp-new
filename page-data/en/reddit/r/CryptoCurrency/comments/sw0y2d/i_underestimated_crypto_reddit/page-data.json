I deeply underestimated how progressive crypto reddit is. The core developers, core exchange CEO, and entire fintwitter and crypto twitter are drastically more conservative and libertarian than this, and virtually all of the infrastructure they have built is to attempt to slow down the government, any government for that matter from behaving the way in which Trudeau is now doing, &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;yet here I see 600 comments on a thread with 1200 upvotes by someone going &amp;quot;Hey maybe Banks having this power is a bad idea&amp;quot; -- 600 comments defending KYC, defending CeFi, defending Pfizer, defending Ciphertrace &amp;amp; Chainanalysis &amp;amp; Elliptic, and defending Banks engaging in this behavior, and your willingness to trust the administrative state to not backdoor your crypto without due process, despite you literally defending the abrogation of due process.
