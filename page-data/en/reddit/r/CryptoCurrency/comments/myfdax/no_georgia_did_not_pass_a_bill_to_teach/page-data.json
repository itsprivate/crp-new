If you read the article you will see that:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>It&#39;s from March 12, not recent.</li>\n<li>Any &quot;proposed bill&quot; needs to be approved by both legislature houses (House of Representatives and Senate). It was only approved on the House of Representatives, so it effectivelly wasn&#39;t &quot;passed&quot;.</li>\n<li>It&#39;s already dead on the Senate <a href=\"https://legiscan.com/GA/bill/HB681/2021\">as you can read here: &quot;Status: Engrossed on March 8 2021 - 50% progression, <strong>died in chamber</strong></a>&quot;</li>\n<li>The proposed bill intended to add a <strong>16 point Financial Literacy course</strong> to 10th and 11th graders <strong>where one of them was cryptocurrency</strong> <a href=\"https://www.legis.ga.gov/api/legislation/document/20212022/199139\">as you can see here.</a></li>\n<li>This is literally in the second paragraph of the original article: <em>According to the report, the bill aims to amend the current curriculum for 10th and 11th-grade students. The new program would consist of 16 new areas of financial literacy such as cryptocurrency, balancing a checking account, money management, making investments, and completing loan applications, among other traditional subjects.</em></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Easy conclusion: Georgia is not teaching students about Crytocurrency. People will upvote whatever makes them feel good even though a simple reading of the article and a small amount of critical thinking would make them at least question the way the headline was written.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s be better :)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/myfdax/no_georgia_did_not_pass_a_bill_to_teach/","title":"No, Georgia
