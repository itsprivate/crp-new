Turns out they screwed up the weights for prizes. Additionally, some conditions of the contest were completely bugged and no matter how much you spent, you&amp;#39;d never get the ticket (USDT condition to spend more than X amount).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They even had the balls to accuse people of trolling, this being the admin &amp;amp; &amp;quot;Operations and Community Management.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Understandably, but how are we to know this isn&amp;#39;t some kind of trolling as we only see one winner, we are looking into it. Will get back to everyone later this afternoon.\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The contest has been ended prematurely, the &lt;strong&gt;telegram group closed for messaging&lt;/strong&gt; and all have been told the following:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Due to an overwhelming response to “The Binance Australia Spin the Wheel: Christmas Edition” campaign, our system has encountered a technical issue that has, unfortunately, prompted us to conclude the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Our system had accidentally issued some major prizes to multiple winners. To remediate the issue, we will be drawing one random winner manually from the entries we have received, and the winner will be contacted via official Binance Australia email.\n\nWe sincerely apologise for the inconvenience caused.\n\nStay tuned for our next campaign. \n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This could have been found with a _VERY_ simple QA run, instead of taking responsibility anyone who had won prizes or used their money to get a spin is now out of luck and won&amp;#39;t receive their lost spins OR prizes(which they are legally obligated to give). &lt;strong&gt;Australia has strong consumer protections against this kind of thing, and they will completely disregard it because they can sweep it under the rug and ignore our local laws that they&amp;#39;re obligated to follow.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am one of those people. I lost over $50(maybe more) on this contest and I&amp;#39;ll be walking away with nothing due to their mistakes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;tl;dr: Spin the wheel X times if you&amp;#39;ve traded Y amount. Whenever you spin, you can win a prize. Too many people won prizes of PS5 etc, so they&amp;#39;ve cancelled the competition and told everyone that only one person will get the PS5 etc and they will decide who. No exploit was here, they just messed up the chances.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rkjc2x/binance_does_it_again_refuses_to_pay_out_prizes/","title":"Binance does it again, refuses to pay out prizes won","tags":["CryptoCurrency","reddit"],"date":"December 20, 2021","dateISO":"2021-12-20T13:36:33.000Z","datetime":"2021-12-20 13:36","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"rkjc2x","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rkjc2x/binance_does_it_again_refuses_to_pay_out_prizes/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rkjc2x/binance_does_it_again_refuses_to_pay_out_prizes/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"CryptoCurrency","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency","author":"Dabehman","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Dabehman","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Dabehman","score":193,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"バイナンスがまたやらかす、獲得した賞金の支払い拒否","the_new_excerpt":"バイナンスの扱いは正直言ってうんざりしています。\nプレイするたびに純損失となるミニゲーム（私はあなたの戦いを見ている）または\n糞みたいなコンテスト、サポートの悪さ、対応の悪さ。\n\n今日、Binanceは新しいキャンペーンを開始しました。\nオーストラリア:https://www.binance.com/en-AU/blog/all/binance...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"Binance再次出手，拒绝支付中奖奖金","the_new_excerpt":"坦率地说，我对Binance对待人们的方式感到厌恶，他们误导了我。\n每次游戏都是净亏损的小游戏（我在看你的战斗）或\n糟糕的比赛，糟糕的支持和糟糕的处理。\n\n今天，Binance在澳大利亚发起了一项新的活动\n澳大利亚：https://www.binance.com/en-AU/blog/all/binance...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Binance再次出手，拒絕支付中獎獎金","the_new_excerpt":"坦率地說，我對Binance對待人們的方式感到厭惡，他們誤導了我。\n每次遊戲都是淨虧損的小遊戲（我在看你的戰鬥）或\n糟糕的比賽，糟糕的支持和糟糕的處理。\n\n今天，Binance在澳大利亞發起了一項新的活動\n澳大利亞：https://www.binance.com/en-AU/blog/all/binance...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-rkieif","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rkieif/crypto_attracts_more_money_in_2021_than_all/","title":"Crypto attracts more money in 2021 than all previous years combined.","date":"December 20, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"2021年のクリプトは、これまでのすべての年の合計よりも多くの資金を引き寄せる。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"2021年，加密货币吸引的资金比以前所有年份的总和还要多。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"2021年，加密貨幣吸引的資金比以前所有年份的總和還要多。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-rk9f3a","excerpt":"Welcome to the Daily Discussion.
