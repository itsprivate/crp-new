Set up your own business, study something you love or whatever. Just make sure your brain will keep doing some exercise and that you&#39;ll be part of some group/society.</p>\n\n<p>Seeing so many posts about when lambo, when moon etc., I see myself a few years ago discovering that I could finally hasten by ~10 years my retirement (I&#39;m in my 60&#39;s now). Damn, was I happy about that. I could finally erase all my debt, travel without worrying about days off being discounted of my paycheck, spend lots of time with my family and buy some of the stuff I&#39;ve always wanted. In ~6 months my life changed really hard, and for the better! I gave my grand kids a nice trip do Disney and paid the wedding of my youngest daughter. Suddenly everything fit perfectly.</p>\n\n<p>After 7-8 months, then, I got myself thinking like &quot;so... is this it?&quot;. I was not happy anymore. Don&#39;t get me wrong: I wasn&#39;t <em>unhappy</em>, but I wasn&#39;t happy either. I would wake up everyday, go for a walk, pass by some bakery and buy some stuff, and get back home to surf on the web. I could of course travel to wherever I wanted, but what for? </p>\n\n<p>Friends came in asking for money and I never heard from them again. Some relatives thought I&#39;d won the lottery and suddenly became extremely friendly and helpful, even though literally no one but my daughter and her husband were here at my wife&#39;s funeral. </p>\n\n<p>At the end, I&#39;ve decided to go back to studying and finally entered college. It changed my way of perceiving the world and now I&#39;m quite happy. I&#39;ve also volunteered at some NGOs in my city and it helped me to keep my pace with society.</p>\n\n<p>So my advice is that you need to get prepared to deal with boredom. We grow up with our parents telling us to go to school, have a job, a car, a house and that this is life. But when you suddenly have the car, the house and everything else, what&#39;s left? Do something for yourself and have this in mind. </p>\n\n<p>Boredom hits hard and you need to get prepared to deal with it.</p>\n\n<p>Godspeed to you all!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON
