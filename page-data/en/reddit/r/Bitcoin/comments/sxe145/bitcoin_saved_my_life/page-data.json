Had the wife and kids with me. Went to fill up and my cards keep getting declined. Try to call the bank and they had froze my accounts due to &amp;quot;suspected fraudulent activity&amp;quot; and said there was nothing they could do for 24 hours. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No way to access any of my money and didn&amp;#39;t have enough gas to make it home. Was starting to get a little nervous. Then I remembered I had some money in bitcoin. I was able to find a crypto atm (didn&amp;#39;t even know those existed) within a quarter mile that I walked to. At this atm, I was able to sell some of my bitcoin and withdraw cash from the atm, which I was then able to use to buy gas to get home. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Insanely lucky I had funds that were practical/useful when my bank was not accessible. And thus I realized the true benefit of Bitcoin. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just wanted to share, as I&amp;#39;ve never seen, firsthand, the practical use of crypto currency before. Here was a situation where I was unable to access a resource through a &amp;quot;respected&amp;quot; financial institution, but i was able to access and utilize crypto currency. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: Stuck out of town and needed gas.
