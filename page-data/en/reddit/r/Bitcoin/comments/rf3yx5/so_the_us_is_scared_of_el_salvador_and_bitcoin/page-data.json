Like the US has been controlling our country and doing whatever they wanted since the civil war we had in the 70&amp;#39;s when they influenced the government or even before in the 50&amp;#39;s when they used to slave us and control the fruit exports from us and also started to control the corruption. That is a historic fact that everybody knows here in El Salvador and and a practice that they kept until the current  government and they are still thinking that they can keep doing it, but we are a different society now.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was revealed that the US tried to buy Salvadorian politicians recently and today we had a new protest with US flags everywhere (they don&amp;#39;t even hide it anymore). The politicians who had accepted money from the US in exchange for decision power are being processed by our laws and El Salvador just opened a new media channel to fight agains all the fake news that come from Washington DC, for now one of the first El Salvador news in English is this:  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://elsalvadorinenglish.com/2021/12/12/salvadoran-political-opposition-fails-in-a-march-called-against-nayib-bukele/\"&gt;El Salvador news English&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I also forgot to mention that they removed the ambassador and the &amp;quot;foreign&amp;quot; businesses delegate that they had in our country saying that our relation is &amp;quot;complicated&amp;quot; now and tried to put fear in the population making them think that the US is now against us. But the people now sees their government like the interventionists that they&amp;#39;ve always been, we are in peace with their people because a lot of their citizens are also our family but we&amp;#39;re disliking their government.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","slug":"/reddit/r/Bitcoin/comments/rf3yx5/so_the_us_is_scared_of_el_salvador_and_bitcoin/","title":"So the US is scared of El Salvador and Bitcoin","tags":["Bitcoin","reddit"],"date":"December 13, 2021","dateISO":"2021-12-13T09:33:17.000Z","datetime":"2021-12-13 09:33","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"rf3yx5","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/rf3yx5/so_the_us_is_scared_of_el_salvador_and_bitcoin/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/rf3yx5/so_the_us_is_scared_of_el_salvador_and_bitcoin/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"Bitcoin","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin","author":"migu3333l","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/migu3333l","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"migu3333l","score":177,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"アメリカはエルサルバドルとビットコインに怯えているのか","the_new_excerpt":"アメリカはエルサルバドルに対して、ビットコインの採用について行動を起こしましたが、私たちにも\n政治的な決断\n\n私たちの国では、彼らは公然と、私たちを以前の\nを回復するために、私たちのステップに戻る必要があります。\n以前の体制に戻せと...。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"所以美国害怕萨尔瓦多和比特币","the_new_excerpt":"美国对萨尔瓦多采取了关于采用比特币的行动，但也对我们的\n政治决定。\n\n在我们国家，他们一直在公开要求我们回到以前的\n在我们国家，他们一直公开要求我们回到以前的政治管理，回到我们的步骤中去，恢复我们以前的系统。\n我们以前的系统，他们希望回到...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"所以美國害怕薩爾瓦多和比特幣","the_new_excerpt":"美國對薩爾瓦多采取了關於採用比特幣的行動，但也對我們的\n政治決定。\n\n在我們國家，他們一直在公開要求我們回到以前的\n在我們國家，他們一直公開要求我們回到以前的政治管理，回到我們的步驟中去，恢復我們以前的系統。\n我們以前的系統，他們希望回到...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-rf6jyx","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rf6jyx/90_of_all_the_21_million_bitcoin_have_now_been/","title":"90% Of All The 21 Million Bitcoin Have Now Been Mined","date":"December 13, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"2,100万ビットコインの90％が採掘されました。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"2100万枚比特币中的90%现在已经被开采完毕","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"2100萬枚比特幣中的90%現在已經被開採完畢","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-rf4w9e","excerpt":"I think the most common phrase on this sub, or any related sub, is “not your\nkeys, not your coin.”\n\nI can now finally drop that phrase myself lol.\n\nTook me awhile as I wanted to collect yield.
