I had my last BTC (sats, really) purchases sitting in my exchange and wanted to move them to my (software) wallet that I use on my phone. So I copied/pasted it the address on a secure notepad app that syncs with PC, then checked that the address shown on my PC matched the wallet address. It did, so that&amp;#39;s cool.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So on the PC I copied/pasted it on the address box for the withdrawal at my exchange, it was shown as a valid address and I proceeded with the transaction. WRONG!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I sat there waiting for my funds to appear on my wallet but they never did. Transaction was shown as completed on the exchange and then I got alarmed. Started to write an email to my exchange&amp;#39;s support team and then it clicked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wanted to say that the destination address was &amp;#39;X&amp;#39; but somehow it was being shown as &amp;#39;Y&amp;#39; on the transaction history. But every time I tried to paste my address it was changing right before my eyes. So my email was looking like &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;em&gt;This is mi destination address: &amp;#39;Y&amp;#39; // This is the address shown on the transacion history: &amp;#39;Y&amp;#39;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;. Now, my notepad app was clearly showing that the adddress I was trying to copy was most definitely not &amp;#39;Y&amp;#39;, so something was up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, at that point I deleted the email, no need to bother some support dude because of something that was looking more and more like a royal fuck up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then there it is, there was some malware on my PC that was actively seeking BTC addresses and switching them to something similar but a different address alltoghether from whoever scammer made the damned thing. I clearly fucked up by not realizing that, and now&amp;#39;s too late.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Malwarebytes was quick to find and delete the thing and now the computer&amp;#39;s clean again (just like my exchange account, haha. FUCK.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Be safe out there and double check or triple check everything when doing a transaction. I didn&amp;#39;t realize  at the time so I&amp;#39;m an idiot, but maybe you won&amp;#39;t have to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s malware out there reading your clipboard to find BTC addresses, and when you try to copy/paste it will paste a similar address from the scammer. I didn&amp;#39;t realize so I&amp;#39;m an idiot, but maybe you won&amp;#39;t have to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Okay, thanks for the awards and all. I read the comments but was lazy to reply to each one individually.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1- My PC wasn&amp;#39;t as infested as some of you may think, I actually clean installed windows 11 like 3 weeks ago FFS. I will reformat it again on the weekend, no worries there. The fucking antivirus did find the culprit, though. After deleting the files and restarting the PC, clipboard was behaving correctly again (I checked a shit ton of times).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2- &amp;#39;A secure notepad app that syncs&amp;#39; was just to make it easier to explain. It was Bitwarden, using the note entry options. It&amp;#39;s a password manager so it is indeed secure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3- Mac / Linux people... Let&amp;#39;s just not go there, I don&amp;#39;t care about OS master race. Windows is a great fit for what I use it and all other OS have their flaws too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4- Hardware wallet option is something that I&amp;#39;m always considering, I just fear loosing it, TBH. 2-stage transactions seems like a good enough compromise to me for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5- Software wallet on my phone gets uninstalled after each deposit, because I agree that it&amp;#39;s not a great thing to carry around. Then whenever I want to transfer again I re-download it and use the seed phrase to access my stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;6- Now let&amp;#39;s be clear, I know that evrything&amp;#39;s my fault, here. For what is worth, the address was very similar (first letters were the exact same), and was given as a valid address by the exchange so i trusted it more than I should have, but i did not check the complete string and that&amp;#39;s on me. I&amp;#39;m a bit of a newbie, but not a complete idiot, it&amp;#39;s just that I plain hadn&amp;#39;t heard about this particular scam before (hence why I wrote it to alert any other newbie that could find the info useful).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;7- To the people thinking that this was an ad and I didn&amp;#39;t just lose my money... I wish it was so, I truly truly do. Imagine if those fuckers were paying me, too. Ah... Wouldn&amp;#39;t that be nice? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, you can&amp;#39;t trust your clipboard, there&amp;#39;s a lesson learned.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a few steps back and it kinda sucks, but I&amp;#39;ll go back to stacking sats.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","slug":"/reddit/r/Bitcoin/comments/rwlkd0/heads_up_and_be_safe_i_just_lost_btc_because_of/","title":"Heads up and be safe: I just lost BTC because of Malware that highjacks my clipboard [Windows]","tags":["Bitcoin","reddit"],"date":"January 05, 2022","dateISO":"2022-01-05T21:32:42.000Z","datetime":"2022-01-05 21:32","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"rwlkd0","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/rwlkd0/heads_up_and_be_safe_i_just_lost_btc_because_of/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/rwlkd0/heads_up_and_be_safe_i_just_lost_btc_because_of/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"Bitcoin","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin","author":"_Rafs","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/_Rafs","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"_Rafs","score":331,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"気を引き締めて、安全に。クリップボードをハイジャックするマルウェアでBTCを失った [Windows］","the_new_excerpt":"私は今、かなりの額のBTCを失いました（少なくとも私にとって、貯蓄できるのは\n~100$/月)。最後に購入したBTC(sats, 本当に)を自分の取引所に置いていたのですが\nで、携帯で使っている（ソフトウェアの）ウォレットに移したいと思っていました。そこで私は\nと同期している安全なメモ帳アプリにアドレスをコピー＆ペーストしました。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"抬起头来，注意安全。我刚刚失去了BTC，因为有恶意软件侵入了我的剪贴板[Windows]","the_new_excerpt":"我刚刚损失了大量的BTC（至少对我来说，我只能保存\n~100美元/月）。我把我最后购买的BTC（sats，真的）放在我的交易所里。\n想把它们转移到我在手机上使用的（软件）钱包。所以我\n在一个安全的记事本应用程序上复制/粘贴地址，该应用程序与...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"抬起頭來，注意安全。我剛剛失去了BTC，因爲有惡意軟件侵入了我的剪貼板[Windows]","the_new_excerpt":"我剛剛損失了大量的BTC（至少對我來說，我只能保存\n~100美元/月）。我把我最後購買的BTC（sats，真的）放在我的交易所裏。\n想把它們轉移到我在手機上使用的（軟件）錢包。所以我\n在一個安全的記事本應用程序上覆制/粘貼地址，該應用程序與...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-rwn5a8","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/Bitcoin/comments/rwn5a8/airbnb_to_implement_crypto_payments/","title":"Airbnb To Implement Crypto Payments","date":"January 05, 2022","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Airbnbが暗号化決済を導入へ","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"Airbnb将实施加密货币支付","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"Airbnb將實施加密貨幣支付","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-rws5ye","excerpt":"He said he downloaded Coinbase and bought a bunch of random coins some youtuber\nsuggested.
