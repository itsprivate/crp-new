&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci is reportedly devoting nearly half of his firm’s $3.5 billion worth of assets under management to Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Algorand (ALGO) and crypto-related stocks. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In addition to this, the hedge fund has a lot of belief in Algorand and went on to say:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;“I’ve got a quarter-billion dollars in Algorand right now. I think Algorand will be the Google… Algorand to me is the future. It’s just going to require more and more people doing deep dive due diligence and making the decision to choose it.”&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Scaramucci predicts Algorand will eventually challenge leading competitors in the crypto industry just as Google did in the early days of the internet. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What are your thoughts on investing a cool  $250,000,000.00 in Algorand? Do you think this is a wise move or the hedge fund sees sense?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Panama banking used to be the best in the world for secrecy. Better than Switzerland. But Pablo Escobar pushed the boundaries and helped put an end to all that. The US drug war with Colombia and the cartel’s Panama banking partnership ended when the US threatened sanctions and a gray zone status with all their allies. So the Panamese relented to financial imperialism, seized Escobar’s money, and in the process sullied their reputation like the Swiss and Hong Kongese have done recently. International courts back in the 80s gave no voice to Latin America.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/5nzt0pyipcw81.jpg?width=1140&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e939917a6af288c637f40c839031ba280fcbc4a6&quot;&amp;gt;Sorry Bitcoin Beach City, Panama City is the place to be for Latin companies&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then in 2010, more imperialism flexed: the first Obama Administration made good on their campaign promise of closing tax loopholes and introduced &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;FACTA&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, which hurt Panama quite a bit. This is how I was first introduced to bitcoin. I was permanently banned from Western Union and Moneygram, and placed on an international remittance blacklist. This had to do with the fact I was in the employ of an offshore casino, helping with their double-entry ledger. Bitcoin was a way out. The first casino I worked for went bust because they used a Japanese exchange called Mt. Gox (this was after I left). The second casino went bust in under 6 months because they tried fractionally reserving BTC. This doesn’t work with volatile and deflationary assets though, because as soon as it moved upwards, they were liable for the USD amount for customers looking to cash-out. If memory serves me, the price doubled from November 2011 to February 2012, and it was the second Patriots vs. Giants Super-Bowl game where the latter pulled an upset, de-collateralizing the sportsbook entirely because the wager imbalance was expected to balance out the shady BTC accounting. The third casino blew up because they laundered the Sinaloa’s money via low odds bets (-1000 and lower), and through a sophisticated web sent them to companies the Flores twins in Chicago owned, who eventually turned state’s evidence against El Chapo. The owner of that casino unsurprisingly ended up six-feet-under. The crazy thing is the Sinaloa didn’t use bitcoin in their scheme, because they’d lost a fortune when Silk Road was dismantled, and an operation they ran there went rogue, using the chaos to go dark, emerging as an entirely new competing cartel, keeping the Silk Road profits to seed themselves. The CIA then took the opportunity to run a highly effective disinformation campaign in Mexico-Colombia-Bolivia called &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Tenderscore,&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; proposing bitcoin was a secret US government project designed to dismantle cartels. They also spread the lie that El Chapo’s second imprisonment in Mexico (he escaped) was due to bitcoin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/xj57cmvfocw81.jpg?width=1199&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=61ab4c0f0efb62d5583fe4ef3ca28489de3b8c0b&quot;&amp;gt;Satoshi literally disappeared this same week&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To this day that operation has lingering effects, and that’s the reason why cartels have, to the confusion of many, been so analog and slow to adopt cryptocurrency. Consider the leading privacy coin&amp;amp;#39;s market cap and tx volume--both abysmal. There were legitimate concerns back then by the US government that cartels might swap their $50B-$100B annual profits into BTC, and that in a few short years, it could emerge as collateral, putting both NAFTA and USD demand at risk in Latin America. Real talk. Of course I had nothing to do with any of this stuff. I’m Romanian with a degree from Fordham NY. And it’s very possible the sources I got this information from were dishonest. I also have no contact with these individuals and didn’t even know their real names.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyway, back to Panama’s recent BTC law. It’s important why? Because the barrier for entry is quite low for Latin American COMPANIES. Panama isn’t like El Salvador, which is to say they don&amp;amp;#39;t have blackouts every other week, spotty internet, bad roads, crime everywhere, dirty water, ersatz medical care, untrustworthy banking infrastructure, a president that live-tweets BTC trades, or a government seemingly always on the cusp of instability--the latter of which is important because instability can also mean a new administration that waltzes in and bans everything. For individual plebs, getting a Panamanian visa is too expensive. It’s achieved through what’s called the &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Friendly Nation’s Program.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; It requires $5000 to be deposited in a Panamanian bank (most are now taking BTC deposits as well), then developing an economic tie. This tie is buying a $200k+ property, or investing $200k in the country, or being employed by a company there. That’s not important though, what’s important is that with Panama&amp;amp;#39;s law, we finally have a legit pawn to e4 move. This is a place that Latin American exchanges will relocate to, with plenty of talk already. Game theory suggests the way we get major countries in the Americas (US, Mexico, Canada) to adopt legal tender or zero taxes, are for three places to do it first, ranked in terms of importance:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Puerto Rico&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Panama&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Cuba&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Puerto Rico&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;: because no passport is required for Americans, and no up-front costs, yet PR enjoys all the global relationships the US does. They&amp;amp;#39;re prepping their own BTC laws and are interested in adding BTC as a means to purchase large items like real estate. &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;“The Monte Carlo of the Americas,”&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; one politician recently mused. Great place for remote work and excellent demographics for blockchain work.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/oef5gwctucw81.jpg?width=1200&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=a81f3b7f32464690292c9ab2adc3742cc3405d76&quot;&amp;gt;Puerto Rico&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/why-are-cryptocurrency-evangelists-flocking-to-puerto-rico-5pcfhsfnc&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/why-are-cryptocurrency-evangelists-flocking-to-puerto-rico-5pcfhsfnc&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Panama&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;: because it&amp;amp;#39;s the well-established banking epicenter of Central America and many Latin American countries. It’s an excellent anchorage for tokenized securities settled in bitcoin (like bonds, companies, and products). The prize of these would be Venezuelan oil bonds, because they have the largest proven oil reserves in the world and enormous gasoline refining capacity. All have been degraded obviously, but they need big investment with no strings. 3.5M bpd in the 90s all the way down to 160k now. Their currency has been stable for months because of oil prices.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Cuba&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;: because of their close ties with Russia, Florida, the Florida political establishment, and Latin America at large. Cuba&amp;amp;#39;s currency is also more volatile than bitcoin is, so it&amp;amp;#39;s an excellent place to make inroads, prove utility, and brag about--because of the regime it hopes to undo.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Kudos to El Salvador for being the beta that taught everyone else what worked and what didn&amp;amp;#39;t. They were an important step. 🪦&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When these three get orange pilled, things get interesting, because I don’t see how bitcoin taxes are more than symbolic legalese and completely unenforceable. Yes you can achieve this already with a hard wallet and DEX (I&amp;amp;#39;d know), but a bitcoin circular economy has not arrived just yet. If I make any major purchases, I’m not allowing a government to swipe 30% off the top so they can send it to support a growing foreign war, pay interest on their debt, or bailout commodity traders. When they can articulate the where and what for, in a transparent way, I’ll gladly pay taxes. Until then, you better find someone that can hack my brain or a ColdCard, because my seeds exist nowhere else, have never touched a live internet connection or internet connected device, and never will. PSBT’s rock. And I now live on a bitcoin standard—which took a couple years to figure out.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/plnthcw5pcw81.png?width=4032&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=faf0e8bc5d9329cb621be3ae9e844bf98a4d7b83&quot;&amp;gt;That&amp;amp;#39;s a power cord that goes into a 9V battery, not a connection.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I’m not buying a new $100k boat in the US for $110k after sales taxes, and $150k after capital gains taxes. That’s called financial irresponsibility and starts costing more than the price of dual citizenships or visas with none of the benefits. I’d rather have five S19j miners to go along with the boat. The tax exemption in these countries will allow individuals and companies to maneuver in ways which heretofore have been the privilege of billionaires and banks, from collateralizing your BTC to dispatching liquidity that LN channels want to borrow, all in the language the masses understand: tap, swipe, click. The day is coming when you’ll tell a startup—“&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Okay, so I have ten million sats in lending power.”&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;—and it’ll be a significant sum to part with. That’ll be this decade.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you’re HODLing bitcoin now, look around your group, your family, the circle you run with. You’re the person who will lead them. You are the first mover. You’re the person who will support them. You’re the alpha. This, by the way, does come with responsibility and sacrifice:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Nazmul Islam, forecasting analyst at Insider Intelligence, attributed the increase to new apps that make purchasing cryptocurrency much easier, combined with the popularity of meme coins. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is expected by the end of 2022, the number of US adults who own at least one cryptocurrency will climb 19.0% to 33.7 million.  That equates to 12.8% of the population, having surpassed 10% last year. The largest ownership group will be adults ages 25 to 34, followed by those ages 35 to 44. The smallest but fastest-growing group will be adults ages 65 and over. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/jqr5f5r349w81.png?width=925&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=784c61dc2c06e69ed2323836110459b02778c158&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/jqr5f5r349w81.png?width=925&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=784c61dc2c06e69ed2323836110459b02778c158&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Looking to the future, Islam said that younger people were more optimistic about crypto and were buying it to hold for the long term, whereas older investors were generally more skeptical and risk-averse but were increasingly adding them to retirement funds. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/wqdm1c7d49w81.png?width=922&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=47a4108a00ac8813f44825c8394fd3f6f7b67f14&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/wqdm1c7d49w81.png?width=922&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=47a4108a00ac8813f44825c8394fd3f6f7b67f14&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“Younger investors have a genuine positive outlook on blockchain technology and are buying crypto to hold for a while, expecting prices to continue increasing in the long run,” says Islam.  “Older investors will be more risk-averse and leery of the volatile crypto market. Although, they are increasingly starting to invest in crypto as more retirement funds offer it as an option.” &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/4ala8ymf49w81.png?width=922&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=0c7f5801e4b06e6cfc99cafee33a8f3425ca473b&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/4ala8ymf49w81.png?width=922&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=0c7f5801e4b06e6cfc99cafee33a8f3425ca473b&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Following triple-digit growth last year, crypto payment transaction value globally will surge 70.5% in 2022 to reach $10.40 billion. By the end of 2023, transaction value will grow another 55.4% to exceed $16 billion.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This year, 3.6 million US adults will use cryptocurrency to make a purchase, up 68.6% over last year. That means 10.7% of crypto owners will actually use a cryptocurrency to make a purchase. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/s53mu0gl49w81.png?width=922&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=b59594e13fe22872e9dbe5303040841155a98488&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/s53mu0gl49w81.png?width=922&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=b59594e13fe22872e9dbe5303040841155a98488&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Insights from the study showed a bullish picture for the future of crypto adoption, as well as showcasing the assets users are buying:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;3.6 million people are expected to make crypto payments in 2022, an increase of 69% (nice) from last year.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Payments made using cryptocurrencies will surpass $10 billion in total transaction value globally for the first time this year.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;25-34 was the largest demographic for crypto ownership — making up 11 million of US crypto holders.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The 65+ demographic was the smallest, with just 1.7% adoption rates.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Bitcoin is the most popular asset with 25.2 million holders.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Ethereum, the second-most popular asset, will reportedly have 13.1 million owners this year.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The former United States defense contractor was among the other six participants, including Zcash creator Zooko Wilcox, Bitcoin core developer Peter Todd, and Coin Center’s Peter Van Valkenburgh. All of them received a part of the private key needed to create Zcash.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Allegedly, Snowden didn&amp;amp;#39;t get any compensation, and his involvement was just for the public interest. In his interview with Zcash Media Snowden said: “The reason that I did that was I saw it being worked on by a number of trusted academic cryptographers. And I thought it was a very interesting project because when we look at cryptocurrencies in general, we generally see the cryptographic properties is being used to make sure it’s a fair ledger, but not that it’s been used to ensure that it’s a private ledger. The problem with that is you can’t have free trade unless you have private trade and you can’t have a free society without a free trade.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What is your opinion on Snowden&amp;amp;#39;s role in Zcash?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We all know that this is absolutely not true, and it got me thinking about a very exciting second order effect of Bitcoin nation state adoption.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Basically, it becomes much harder for governments to launder money and be corrupt because of the public nature of the Bitcoin ledger of transactions. Government spending, donations, foreign aid can be tracked on the blockchain.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On the other hand, citizens now enjoy more financial freedom, and can have a good level of pricacy using the Lightning Network.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The government isn&amp;amp;#39;t going to be able to track millions of average people&amp;amp;#39;s transactions on Lightning. This offers a level of privacy comparable to cash. But millions of people can now have their eyes on their government, who&amp;amp;#39;s not going to be able to move millions around unnoticed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;More privacy for the individuals, more transparency for governments. Win-win.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What do you guys think?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: I chose that title because it is a well known quote. I do not support coercive governments, elected or not, but if we&amp;amp;#39;re going to have governments I&amp;amp;#39;d rather have the balance of power tilted more towards people and I think Bitcoin will do just that. &amp;amp;quot;Democracy&amp;amp;quot; definitely isn&amp;amp;#39;t the end game for freedom as far as I&amp;amp;#39;m concerned. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

If BTC had hit 150k, I&amp;amp;#39;d probably agree with the sentiment here, but this is not the case.
BTC peaked at around 70k. The market cap is way too small for what BTC already represents for the world economy.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here is what I expect is gonna happen. The stock market will continue to struggle while investors will look for alternative investments. Since crypto is extremely undervalued, it will decouple from the stock market soon which will create a positive feedback loop, where the more investors move from stocks to crypto, the better crypto performs, which will result in more investors turning to crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Most people who think crypto winter already started have already sold or wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t have sold anyway.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Therefore the rest of the year is going to get exciting. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

This makes Fort Worth the first city in the US to mine its own Bitcoin. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The city estimated that each of the mining rigs would consume &amp;amp;quot;the same amount of energy as a household vacuum cleaner,&amp;amp;quot; adding that the amount of BTC mined by the machines would offset the cost of operating them. NYDIG will custody the city&amp;amp;#39;s Bitcoin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The city said it would evaluate the mining program in six months before deciding whether to continue.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The donated rigs are expected to generate between $2 and $3 per day, according to Minerstat.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Remember that he was invited by the CIA for this conference. That means CIA I knew about Bitcoin.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is what he posted&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I want to get this out in the open because it is the kind of thing that will generate conspiracy theories: I&amp;amp;#39;m going to give a presentation about Bitcoin at CIA Headquarters in June at an emerging technologies conference for the US intelligence community.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I accepted the invitation to speak because the act that I was invited means Bitcoin is already on their radar, and I think it might be a good chance to talk about why I think Bitcoin will make the world a better place. I think the goals of this project are to create better currency, create a more competitive and efficient international payment incompatible with goals of government.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m only very slightly worried that talking about Bitcoin at the CIA will increase the chances that they&amp;amp;#39;ll try to do something we don&amp;amp;#39;t want them to do. I think accepting their invitation and being open about exactly what bitcoin is will make it less likely they will see it as a threat.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;PS: Full Disclosure: I&amp;amp;#39;ll be paid a one-time fee of $3K to cover expenses and pay me for my time. I don&amp;amp;#39;t want any &amp;amp;quot;Gavin is on the CIA&amp;amp;#39;s payroll&amp;amp;quot; rumors to get started, either  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;as always, comments and questions and discussion welcome. I&amp;amp;#39;d really rather not hear any conspiracy theories about how they will secretly implant a mind-control chip in my head while I&amp;amp;#39;m there, though.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Once you get a decent amount in your bags, and it becomes more than what you want to leave on an exchange, you may have to start dealing with managing your own wallet and your backup seed phrase, which you have to store securely.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That&amp;amp;#39;s those 12-24 random words that serves as a way to recover your wallet.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;The don&amp;amp;#39;ts:&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;1- Settling for just paper.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We have a lot of papers, mail, cards, etc, passing through our daily lives. Another piece of paper can get lost in the mix. It&amp;amp;#39;s crazy how pieces of papers we think we&amp;amp;#39;ve stored securely, sometimes just vanish.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Worse....paper is not durable. If your house is flooded, burns down, that paper could get easily destroyed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you have thousands of dollars, do you want it to be backed up on something that can easily burn away?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/ifaefshzc3w81.jpg?width=600&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=5574f661de71ca9b3de3cb4e8df2633ce50f1058&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/ifaefshzc3w81.jpg?width=600&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=5574f661de71ca9b3de3cb4e8df2633ce50f1058&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;2- Printing your seed.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Most people know better not to store their seed online, on their computer, phone, or any device with an online connection. But many don&amp;amp;#39;t realize that printers have a network connection to their computer.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Printers are a weak point of entry for an attack. It&amp;amp;#39;s typically one of the weakest point in a network.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On top of that, everything you print gets temporarily stored on your printer, long after you&amp;amp;#39;ve finished and turned off your printer.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The last thing you want stored on your printer is your seed phrase.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;3- Putting your seed in a portable safe.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Safe make it obvious where you store your most valuable stuff. But that&amp;amp;#39;s OK, as long as no one can break in, or worse just pick it up. There&amp;amp;#39;s nothing worse than a safe that someone can just lift and carry, even if it may take two people.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The only case where you would do this. Is if where you live, there is very little risk of burglary, and greater risk of fire, but the funds are too small to be worth investing into a proper safe.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/3fk5x637d3w81.jpg?width=306&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=165a674f026de429fea9562ac1d7ceded074c247&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/3fk5x637d3w81.jpg?width=306&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=165a674f026de429fea9562ac1d7ceded074c247&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;4- Creating too much mental gymnastics.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s not just the flimsy security that can turn against you, too much security can be your biggest enemy.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You still need to be able to access it, and figure it out easily. That means a year from now, you still need to be able to figure out how to find it, access it, decode it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You don&amp;amp;#39;t want to have so much security that it locks you out, and you can&amp;amp;#39;t recover your key.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Only have the level of security you need, and accessible enough for you.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You aren&amp;amp;#39;t guarding the nuclear codes. So you don&amp;amp;#39;t need to give yourself insane mental gymnastics to access your funds.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;5- Sharing your seed phrase.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A seed phrase is not something you&amp;amp;#39;ll ever need to share with anyone.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A seed phrase is not something people need to send you funds, or send you a prize, or reward.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Much less is Ledger, Trezor, or any company you&amp;amp;#39;ve dealt with for crypto ever need your seed phrase.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Same when you store it. You don&amp;amp;#39;t want to share it with the entire internet. So don&amp;amp;#39;t leave it in the cloud. Even if it&amp;amp;#39;s password protected, you are still leaving on someone else&amp;amp;#39;s server. There&amp;amp;#39;s no way to ever be sure if those servers have a backdoor vulnerability.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;5 good tricks:&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;1- Engraving your seed.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There&amp;amp;#39;s 3 ways to store your seed in a fire/flood proof way. Engrave it with a stamp, engrave it with a pen, or use pre-made letters.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;From my experience, pre-made letters is the worst. It&amp;amp;#39;s still costly, and if the trap door gets loose, you lose your seed. And the letters don&amp;amp;#39;t seem to be impressed too well.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/omnvkpjwe3w81.jpg?width=1200&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=375b8af9c26badb465c26c4715a878ecacfb7e04&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/omnvkpjwe3w81.jpg?width=1200&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=375b8af9c26badb465c26c4715a878ecacfb7e04&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Stamps are fine, but it&amp;amp;#39;s more time consuming, I sometimes don&amp;amp;#39;t get a good impression, and it&amp;amp;#39;s not even much cheaper.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/ngtx76sxe3w81.jpg?width=1280&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=5658c6b34ddd5734f33fc6e272e2858cc1d92e01&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/ngtx76sxe3w81.jpg?width=1280&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=5658c6b34ddd5734f33fc6e272e2858cc1d92e01&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Engraving pens are actually not expensive. You can get good ones on Amazon for $30. And you can engrave it on anything. You can control better how deep the impression will be.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/vii08iqye3w81.jpg?width=600&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=b728c3ead5928f511676140156cb08afce7daf3a&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/vii08iqye3w81.jpg?width=600&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=b728c3ead5928f511676140156cb08afce7daf3a&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;2- A proper safe.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Obviously, this is a bigger investment, so it&amp;amp;#39;s only gonna be worth it if there&amp;amp;#39;s big funds to safeguard behind those private keys.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;No need to buy a $1,500 safe to protect $1,000 worth of crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While a safe will let a burglar know where all your valuable stuff is, knowing won&amp;amp;#39;t help much if they can&amp;amp;#39;t break in.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Or at least, take too long. Every safe can be broken into. Some just take muuuch longer.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Make sure you have a safe that&amp;amp;#39;s hard to break into. Don&amp;amp;#39;t get a cheap SentrySafe. Get a good brand. Locks using keys are the easiest to break into. Get one with a keypad.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As I said before, don&amp;amp;#39;t get one that a burglar can just carry off. Nor a wall safe that&amp;amp;#39;s easy to pull off from your drywall.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;More importantly, get a safe with a strong fire delay rating.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;3- Getting creative with your storage.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you can&amp;amp;#39;t afford a proper safe, or don&amp;amp;#39;t have enough funds to make it worthwhile, or are renting a place and can&amp;amp;#39;t bolt anything to the ground, then you can always get creative at storing hiding your seed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hiding a seed phrase in accessible places, requires the help of tip #5 on my list: encryption.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A good rule of thumb, a good hiding place usually involves having to unscrew something.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But you don&amp;amp;#39;t necessarily have to hide your plate. You can also engrave parts of your seed on things.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That could be any metal part in your house, or anything with any chance of resisting a fire.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/2fi89rwfy3w81.jpg?width=1600&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=4d402296017db2ef0a9676e2953127115ad1edc8&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/2fi89rwfy3w81.jpg?width=1600&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=4d402296017db2ef0a9676e2953127115ad1edc8&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But not all metals have the same degree of fire resistance.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You&amp;amp;#39;ll likely lose a lot of fire resistance doing this.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you are worried about fires, you&amp;amp;#39;ll sill want to stick with a more fire resistant plate.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/nqz9kdx3h3w81.jpg?width=1200&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=aa7c5b99f926d677e4ee69031d033dde0510ddc2&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/nqz9kdx3h3w81.jpg?width=1200&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=aa7c5b99f926d677e4ee69031d033dde0510ddc2&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;4- Consider using multiple locations.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can have parts of the seed phrase in multiple places in your house, or at entirely different locations. But if you do that, losing one portion means you lose it all, so be careful.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can also use multiple locations if you want multiple backups. You could give an encrypted version with a family member to put in their safe.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;5- Encrypt or cypher your seed.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You don&amp;amp;#39;t necessarily have to write your 24 words in order from 1 to 24, nor even write the actual words.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is getting into a little bit of mental gymnastics, so be careful. But if you can keep it simple and have a method of recovering the process, it&amp;amp;#39;s fine. Don&amp;amp;#39;t rely on your memory to decode it a year later.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Basically, it&amp;amp;#39;s scrambling or coding your seed. So even if someone finds your seed phrase, it will be jumbled.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With encryption, you don&amp;amp;#39;t even need to split your seed phrase into multiple locations in your house. You can keep it all on one plate, with probably still a lot more security.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Just be careful where you store the decoder, or the method of decoding.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If all it takes is for someone to have the decoder to get your seed, then your seed is only as secure as your decoder.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There&amp;amp;#39;s a ton of methods around this. Look into different cyphers, different types of encryptions. Find one that suits you.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Encrypting your seed opens up the door to how you can more easily and safely store your seed phrase.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Most of the retailers in the market have been leaving crypto, for now. Last approximate 1.5 years a lot of hype was present and a lot of retailers joined the party for quick gains. Now that the market topped at the last all time high, and we have been in an accumulation range for a long period, most people looking for gold have given up. Or they have been liquidated.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Throughout the, brief, history of bitcoin (and cryptocurrency in general) there have been multiple periods like the one we are in now. Historically, these periods were followed by new jumps of the market to new highs.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you are reading this, you haven&amp;amp;#39;t given up. Or at least you shouldn&amp;amp;#39;t. Be careful now with any trades you make. There are roughly three things you could do. Hodl and wait. Sell most, if not all, wait for a definitive bottom and buy in after confirmation. Or wait to buy in when upper resistance levels have cleared and the markets are in a bull run again.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All of the above, I believe, will yield you good gains in coming 6-18 months. Not something I can guarantee obviously. But look at adoption, growth, technology emerging in the crypto industry. There is no doubt for me it will be used more than ever in the future.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Stay calm. Be patient. Being here puts you in a favorable position in comparison with most.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That&amp;amp;#39;s the crypto market.. and of you can&amp;amp;#39;t sit calmly even when you see your portfolio dips for months at a time.. then you have too much emotion invested in this and should reevaluate your position.. maybe talking to an investor and getting safe returns is more on your level.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I don&amp;amp;#39;t understand why people invest so much that it stresses them out when everyone here is constantly screaming warnings of how volatile this market is.. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Today he/she/they released their last message to the public, that already forshadowed the disappearance, the message was about not caring much about him but Bitcoin as a whole and the Dev team that was and is basically working for free on Bitcoin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now after 11 years many see this as a major mystery and maybe say that he even died. But for me it&amp;amp;#39;s seems clear that he knowingly made this decision of going out forever.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;During that time he disappeared, Bitcoin was picking up pace for the first time. Already the first big investments came in and it actually was seen as serious by some people. His work was done. He brought Bitcoin to the light and it was not his task to bring it further.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Because of his disappearance, today no one is capable of criticising him as he basically does not exist. He left making Bitcoin truely neutral, there is no  &amp;amp;quot;head&amp;amp;quot; or maker that has any specific goals for this projects, it&amp;amp;#39;s truely just us.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The oldest post I can find is something in &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;2013&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; asking for good alt coins, but it got the same reply as what someone today would be asking that. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;2014&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; there was a ton of post on giveaway, a few asking for help in making a crypto coin (one I found looked like a rug pull or just a coin that got some hyped and died), some post about mining, some post about how there will be how and why alt coins will overtake BTC.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What I found interesting with that last bit is they were talking about the transaction speeds of BTC and things like that. The focus was still on using it as a currency.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The one I found interesting is &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/2a1y8f/the_death_of_dogecoin/&quot;&amp;gt;https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/2a1y8f/the_death_of_dogecoin/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/auk515f8kwv81.png?width=1100&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=5bf6c8dc9938a610fd61fd22740a5d43ab232507&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/auk515f8kwv81.png?width=1100&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=5bf6c8dc9938a610fd61fd22740a5d43ab232507&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Basically, people 8 years ago was facing the same problems as we are today in the SEC is highly unclear and how people weren&amp;amp;#39;t sure what to invest in because the USA dragged it&amp;amp;#39;s feet when dealing with crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;2015&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; it seems like most were asking if a coin is dead, they were talking about how hard it is to invest thanks due to banks, and other things&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For that year I found this to be interesting &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/3gtg5g/whats_the_most_interesting_altcoin_youve_ever/&quot;&amp;gt;https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/3gtg5g/whats_the_most_interesting_altcoin_youve_ever/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They asked what is the most interesting alt coin. Most of them I never heard of and they died a long time ago. But this is an interesting comment.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/tny0c7gclwv81.png?width=1081&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=55e6682cc4d93c851e138057a4d406115510106c&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/tny0c7gclwv81.png?width=1081&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=55e6682cc4d93c851e138057a4d406115510106c&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/7hma0mqelwv81.png?width=1146&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=f144f2959647cadfb1662ca8943a9724c74ee343&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/7hma0mqelwv81.png?width=1146&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=f144f2959647cadfb1662ca8943a9724c74ee343&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Something to note is we get some FUD 2014 and 2015 against Doge. Even comments saying &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/hoi1k9x4mwv81.png?width=1064&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=ce713a9b19ccb102b60fc2653886843ddb158280&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/hoi1k9x4mwv81.png?width=1064&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=ce713a9b19ccb102b60fc2653886843ddb158280&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Even ETH is looked as a scam. But note this is people like today trying to figure out the good from bad in the tech.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/zgy2frjimwv81.png?width=1117&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e23b91ea40d4771111797713d7c1f7714b492fc1&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/zgy2frjimwv81.png?width=1117&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e23b91ea40d4771111797713d7c1f7714b492fc1&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;2016&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; has more people looking for alt coins, best coins to mine, how to get into mining, exchanges, and stuff like that.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Basically, this is the year when people started wanting to do something with their coins or do something like mining to get coins. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Looking at some recommendation coins shows what we see now where people don&amp;amp;#39;t know what they are talking about&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/qz7gtmjinwv81.png?width=1153&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=31aa8705adbb4ec24d9665424b9de8b605841233&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/qz7gtmjinwv81.png?width=1153&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=31aa8705adbb4ec24d9665424b9de8b605841233&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/346z4xhlnwv81.png?width=1137&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=1b2e36d78f86fd4eea0d22fb08be688d38308c4a&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/346z4xhlnwv81.png?width=1137&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=1b2e36d78f86fd4eea0d22fb08be688d38308c4a&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In that same post people were seriously recommending things like Truck Coin. There was some that gave good advice, like what you see today &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/s1q56satnwv81.png?width=1072&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=d9735a59f350b564a7324bdbeb3b7ad206c4f593&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/s1q56satnwv81.png?width=1072&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=d9735a59f350b564a7324bdbeb3b7ad206c4f593&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There is almost no word about Doge but there is a number of post about ETH. It looks like ETH is taken serious at this point. Same with Litecoin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;2017&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; there was post about what coin will 10x in 2018, more ETH post, Doge, memes started to come up, people freaking out about dips, and so on.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/ldo8vrnqowv81.png?width=640&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=b0b9f8d50b6bce66d72002e3e548fea4162c5ffa&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/ldo8vrnqowv81.png?width=640&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=b0b9f8d50b6bce66d72002e3e548fea4162c5ffa&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I found that cute. that is like a 10am for me. I wonder what they would be like with the losses we have now.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There is Coinbase fud because Coinbase added a coin they didn&amp;amp;#39;t like. And again people were talking about how the SEC isn&amp;amp;#39;t being clear with their regulations.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Most of the post were like a 2021 where the price went everywhere.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;2018&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Robinhood launches it&amp;amp;#39;s crypto trading app, Bitconnect, and virtually nothing else showed up on the search. IDK I guess it was a dead year. The daily went from 14k to 2k comments.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;2019&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; this looks like another dead year since the daily was getting 3k comments, there was some fud on how BTC uses more electricity than most small countries (while overlooking BTC is worldwide and comparing it is stupid). There was some push for NANO. Some post about ETH, the Binance block against USA people, and that is about it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;2020&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; another dead year. The daily was getting 1k comments some months. There was XRP FUD, hacks, the XRP SEC thing, and that is about it. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;2021&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; the daily kicks back up with some days getting 35k comments. Anyone who was there would tell you it was price, meme, lambo, questions for those coming in, and so on.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The Final Message&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Satoshi sent this message to early Bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen as a response to Andresen talking about Satoshi in the press&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;“I wish you would stop talking about me as a mysterious shadowy figure. The press just turns that into a pirate currency angle. Maybe instead make it about the open source project and give more credit to contributors. It helps motivate them.”&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Satoshi did not want to be the leader or founder figure of Bitcoin. He wanted it to be a pure open source project created by and for all of humanity. It was clear from the beginning in every decision he made and his actions make more and more sense after he left.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Even 6 months before this final message, there were already signs that Satoshi would leave. In December 2010, he removed his name from Bitcoin&amp;amp;#39;s SourceForge license document and updated all email contacts on Bitcoin.org to other developers. Satoshi&amp;amp;#39;s last public message on Bitcointalk was on December 12, 2010. Through Gavin, he asked all the volunteer developers to take the project forward.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This was Gavin&amp;amp;#39;s message on behalf of Satoshi shared to Bitcointalk forum on January 13, 2011.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“So who is willing and able to help out? Don&amp;amp;#39;t ask permission, just jump in, grab a bug that catches your interest, add comments to it as you start to figure out what the problem is (or isn&amp;amp;#39;t), and submit a PULL request when you have a fix.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Your reward will be recognition, admiration and respect. It is time to take bitcoin from, essentially, a single-programmer project to a robust open source project with lots of contributors.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;By studying the early history of Bitcoin it&amp;amp;#39;s clear that Satoshi only planned to stay as long as he was needed to get Bitcoin up and running. Once others started chipping in, he knew his work was done and he left.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Today there are hundreds of Bitcoin developers but you may not know that they don&amp;amp;#39;t get any salary to work on Bitcoin. They are supported only by sponsors and donations. If you hold good amount of BTC, maybe you should consider donating at least 1% to Bitcoin FOSS developers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Somewhere in America, a lump of coal is burned every time a book is ordered on-line.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/forbes/1999/0531/6311070a.html?sh=12b1b1ad2580&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.forbes.com/forbes/1999/0531/6311070a.html?sh=12b1b1ad2580&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The current fuel-economy rating: about 1 pound of coal to create, package, store and move 2 megabytes of data. The digital age, it turns out, is very energy-intensive. The Internet may someday save us bricks, mortar and catalog paper, but it is burning up an awful lot of fossil fuel in the process.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
There are already over 17,000 pure dot-com companies (Ebay, E-Trade, etc.).&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
The larger ones each represent the electric load of a small village.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Media tried to gaslight and brainwash tech companies with the burning fossil fuel narrative.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some 20 years onwards, this entire article reads like a joke.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Getting the bits from dot-com to desktop requires still more electricity. Cisco&amp;amp;#39;s 7500 series router, for example, keeps the Web hot by routing an impressive 400 million bits per second, but to do that it needs 1.5 kilowatts of power. The wireless Web draws even more power, because its signals are broadcast in all directions, rather than being tunneled down a wire or fiber&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
Just fabricating all these digital boxes requires a tremendous amount of electricity. The billion-dollar fabrication plants are packed with furnaces, pumps, dryers and ion beams, all electrically driven. It takes 9 kilowatt-hours to etch circuits onto a square inch of silicon, and about as much power to manufacture an entire PC (1,000 kilowatt-hours)as it takes to run it for a year. And there are at least 300 of these factories in the U.S. Collectively, fabs and their suppliers currently consume nearly 1% of the nation&amp;amp;#39;s electric output.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
The global implications are enormous. Intel projects a billion people on-line worldwide. That&amp;amp;#39;s $1 trillion in computer sales -- and another $1 trillion investment in a hard-power backbone to supply electricity. One billion PCs on the Web represent an electric demand equal to the total capacity of the U.S. today.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Does this resemble the current attacks against cryptocurrencies?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The exact same arguments are now used against bitcoin, trying to fool people into believing that bitcoin is the worst thing in the world.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thousands of people believe what these articles at face value despite not having any understanding of the intricacies of bitcoin mining&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
