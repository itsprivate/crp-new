To make quick money. &amp;amp;quot;Why do you care about price going up or down if you are never selling?&amp;amp;quot; and other silly arguments.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And let me tell you. Yes the majority here, is in it for the money. It&amp;amp;#39;s because we are screwed. The society is still expecting an average male to earn a lot of money and provide for their family etc. but people in their 30s have been f**d in the arse for the last 15 years or more. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;No wage growth, no prospects in many countries, constant financial crisis that keeps hitting and hitting us from all sides, and now inflation which will melt our savings, that is if we are lucky to have any savings in the first place, education system is a joke in most countries, crippling debts, high cost of living, rents going up and up, and so on and on, I could go on forever.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto for a lot of us is the only way out, our only way to be able to afford a house or a flat in the future. So yeah, you bet I&amp;amp;#39;m in it for the money and I don&amp;amp;#39;t give a damn what people think. Priority number one for me is to provide for my family.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Ive been into BTC for nearly 2 years now. The longer time carries on, the farther down the rabbit hole I go.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Typically, I have been DCA&amp;amp;#39;ing every pay day up until a week ago. I have always thrown whatever extra change and money I have laying around into it. I no longer buy stocks as it always feels too much like a gamble. I can never just be happy holding stocks. It was like chasing a high finding the next &amp;amp;#39;money maker.&amp;amp;#39; The banks must have loved me and all the stupid fee&amp;amp;#39;s Id pay buying and selling as I carry on the chase.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But then Bitcoin entered my life. And life became easier. Stocks became meaningless. A Maxi I became. No more stocks. Savings being placed entirely into the soundest money of all time: Bitcoin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fast forward to January. My father has a fatal, and extremely rare stroke; a Cerebellar Stroke. You would never have seen it coming. Not your typical stroke symptoms. 2 weeks later after a battle in ICU he passed. He didn&amp;amp;#39;t leave much. He was a free spirit. Retired early, and lived and travelled in a van. My step-mom, who he divorced a decade ago, kept paying his life insurance that he neglected to pay.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So with many thanks to my step-mother, I received inheritance.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;First thing I did, I paid off debts. Helped the wife pay down a lot of debt. Upgraded the house.... slightly. Nothing too major.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Im keeping a bit of fiat in savings. Sadly, letting it get eaten away from inflation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The rest, I dedicated to buying up the remainder of what I need of a whole BTC. Total cost roughly, $35,000 USD.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Enter: The Royal Bank of Canada. Canada&amp;amp;#39;s biggest bank. A bank of which I have been with for many a year. I have savings accounts with them. I have a larger LOC with them. I used to use their investment services.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Banks are not your friends. I am aware of this.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But, honestly, its 2022. The banking system is stuck in the 1980&amp;amp;#39;s.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This past Monday, March 21st, I went to the bank to wire the $35K to NDAX, a leading Canadian Crypto Exchange (0.2% buy fee, $15 transfer out fee). Did the paperwork, confirmed the info, and boom, done. Later, the advisor from the bank called to ask me some questions from the Anti-Money Laundering department. Cool, a couple verification questions. I answered honestly. Advisor said &amp;amp;quot;great, expect to receive the wire tomorrow.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Tuesday, nothing received. This is a domestic wire transfer. Should take a day, tops.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Wednesday, March 23rd, Im in the bank again. Branch manager tells me the wire was flagged as &amp;amp;quot;too risky.&amp;amp;quot; You cannot imagine the disbelief in me. The bank was deeming what I was doing with my money as &amp;amp;quot;too risky.&amp;amp;quot; As if they had some control over what I choose to do with my money. Its sad enough its 2022, and there isn&amp;amp;#39;t an easier way to send $35K, which honestly isn&amp;amp;#39;t even that much damn money in todays age.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After raising a stink, and showing the branch manager my Bitcoin tattoo, I informed him I was &amp;amp;quot;WELL AWARE OF THE RISKS.&amp;amp;quot; I also had to mention that its risky leaving my savings in a bank that has a less than 1% interest rate in their savings accounts. I was asked to show proof that I have dealt with NDAX before. I was asked if anyone told me Id make a fortune buying BTC? Standard money-laundering questions. Check-Check-Check. Passed the test, AGAIN.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Manager put a word in with Wire Transfer department, and the money was finally taken from my account.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thursday rolls around now. Still, nothing. Nothing at all. Money, stuck in limbo somewhere. In some sort of electronic bank cloud.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Today. Friday. Guess where I am again for a 3rd time? The fucking bank. More times in 1 week than in 2 years. Remember everyone... its 2022. Nope, sorry, I cannot call them because when it comes to wires I have to physically enter the branch I sent the wire from.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This time I get branch manager involved, a co-manager involved, and of course an advisor. All looking into this shit for me. Im livid. Its Friday. The original wire was supposed to be sent Monday. Tomorrow is a weekend. WTF?!?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Turns out, under money-laundering investigation, AGAIN. More questions asked. Anyone put you up to this? Have you used NDAX before? How did you hear about them? Are you going to do business with them again? Blah blah blah. I passed again. I was told then to await an email or a phone call when this has all been settled. 2 hours pass. I email the branch manager, livid. Nothing still.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then, around 3PM, I was told the money was released.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Guess I have to wait the weekend to receive it on Monday. Those fuckers at the bank!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But no! As soon as NDAX received it into their processing, I received the wire transfer! 530PM Pacific time! Last minute.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Of course everyone will say &amp;amp;#39;HEY! DCA that shit!&amp;amp;quot; I get it. I DCA&amp;amp;#39;d for so long that it was just nice to cop what I needed and throw it into Cold Storage. The few dollars Id save DCA&amp;amp;#39;ing mean nothing to me in 10 years. Its nice to just have a solid 1/21,000,000, and to take it off the market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But that&amp;amp;#39;s not the total point of this at all. We need to all be happy for each other for any amount of BTC we have at any cost we got it. This is the future. This is the sound choice.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The point is this tho:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Banks are not your friends. Banks consider you GUILTY UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT when wiring any sort of money.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And this my friends.... is why we Bitcoin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Peace and Love Bitcoin Community.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I started writing a piece about why we shouldn’t mind KYC unless we’re criminals, and through my journey, I realized I was totally wrong.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;First, there’s a data breach; once a hack happens on all KYC data, the amount of info they will get would be astounding. They could literally take your ID and sell them to identity thieves if they don’t use them themselves. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The second is that all of that information you supply can be used against you without a warrant. Of course, if you are not a criminal, you think you have nothing to worry about. But there are more instances than not of people being wrongly implicated in crimes.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Third, people have to go through a lot of fucking shit to provide the necessary assets for KYC, and some people don’t have the means to do that. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This was definitely a lesson in DYOR for me. A total turnaround in viewpoint.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This includes a flat 30% tax on all crypto trades.. because the govt enabled and helped you to trade right? 🤷&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also you cant claim capital losses, but have to pay capital gains. Lol..&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And the worst of the lot, each time you trade, you have to remit 1% of the trade to the government as tax deducted at source. For example if you buy $100 BTC, you pay $1 right away, the seller is supposed to deduct this..so you only get $99. This will kill market makers who make hundreds of trades every day to provide liquidity. Imagine if they have to pay 1% on each trade, their capital is going to get sucked out pretty hard. As a result you will have very thin order books on CEX as market makers will exit. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Since the laws are kicking in soon, Monero p2p platforms have gained some popularity. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is a popular Monero platform that was almost a ghost town even in January with hardly any traders,  but all of a sudden there are dozens of sellers there with hundreds if not thousands of trades. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/157b7pplfjp81.jpg?width=2726&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=ec252c8e69e6fa35fe7f24dc6fcf796f50deec7f&quot;&amp;gt;Monero p2p boom&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bisq has not seen much growth though, as it has a steeper learning curve.. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These laws show the government is clueless as to what crypto is and how much . As ZK tech becomes more popular, it would be much more easier trading P2P crypto with one another&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

From the current market situation it seem like BTC and ETH may be the only ones that would overcome anything even if they fall 99%, due to a nuclear war or some alien invasion or some other worst case shit, they will recover as long as humanity does.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I mean literally every other top 10 crypto has flaws (also BTC and ETH have those) and especially some uncertainty. Tether is obviously doomed, XRP is battling in court, SOL is going out every month, LUNA is too new to tell, ADA is more buzz than actual stuff, and the list goes like that for every crypto according to me.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We have seen a couple of top 10 cryptos over the past few years loose out completely. So what do you think? Is there any coin that actually has capability to survive anything and always stay where it is today?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Smart contract compatibility with contract to contract calls.  This allows complex dApps to be built that can efficiently and trustlessly interact with other smart contract based dApps to extend functionality and usability.  Additional details and background on this tech can be found &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/algorand/hello-contract-calling-abff8fc00939&quot;&amp;gt;here&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Post-quantum secure &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Falcon Keys&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, Algorand’s first major milestone on its path towards trustless cross-chain interoperability.  These keys will, in the near future, be used to generate &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;State Proofs,&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; a new blockchain infrastructure that will allow Algorand to be trustlessly accessed in low-power environments like mobile phones, smart watches, and on other blockchains. For more background on State Proofs, please see an overview &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/algorand/algorand-state-proofs-707d64038e35&quot;&amp;gt;here&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Developers are now able to build complex dapps for the Algorand ecosystem with smart contract-to-contract calling and network participants can take their first step towards trustless cross-chain interoperability with quantum-secure keys for the upcoming State Proof technology. These network upgrades come on the heels of a $20 million incentive program from the Algorand Foundation focused on developer tooling and&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://algorand.foundation/news/10-million-evm-compatibility-grant&quot;&amp;gt; EVM compatibility&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, putting Algorand at the forefront of blockchain interoperability and post-quantum security while providing features for even more advanced decentralized applications. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These features add to Algorand’s already advanced tech, high performance and robust developer resources. Smart contracts on Algorand can be written in Python or Reach, making it accessible for developers of all skillsets. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Algorand has experienced zero downtime since launch, helping it become the blockchain of choice for hundreds of organizations launching DeFi protocols, NFTs, payment solutions, regulated digital assets, and more. The network supports applications that can scale to billions of participants, all on a high-speed, carbon-negative, secure and stable blockchain. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

ii) No loss setoff&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Indian financial cycle is completes on 31st March. People are planning to sell on 31st and buy back on 1st to make their losses count in the previous FY and the current holdings can be shown as purchase.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
This is why DEXes are important, but the only problem is how to get your fiat into crypto for the first time. People mostly use Binance P2P but now Binance asks for KYC it is becoming increasingly hard to own crypto without the government  knowing about it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

(Looking at Syria, Venezuela.. etc) All those thinking they sit on a moral high ground calling for the hunger of millions of people are disgusting double standard subhumans that have no empathy for their fellow human. I&amp;amp;#39;ve seen people dying of hunger in the streets and guess what ? The governments are still strong and standing cause this isn&amp;amp;#39;t a fairy tail where the good side always wins.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Double standard cause the US have done far worse than this in literally every war they financed and/or were directly involved with, yet if anyone mentions this they&amp;amp;#39;re accused of being Putin apologists.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I can&amp;amp;#39;t fathom how cruel some people can get and calling for the hunger of a whole nation because of the actions of their fucked up dictator ! Do you (americans) think that you, your families and tour children deserve to suffer and famined because of your government&amp;amp;#39;s actions in the middle east, Latin America and around the world ? Do you ?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fuck every single government. Power to the people.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You don&amp;amp;#39;t understand the basics of decentralisation, it&amp;amp;#39;s NOT hooray decentralisation unless some with a different belief system is using it. God I hate this sub lately&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit : I mentioned the US doing far worse to point out that the American people DON&amp;amp;#39;T deserve living in a famine for their government&amp;amp;#39;s actions, same like the Russian people or any other nation&amp;amp;#39;s people for that matter. Not because I&amp;amp;#39;m pro-dictatorship like people are accusing me of.. but I think I won&amp;amp;#39;t defend myself anymore cause some people are so agenda oriented and so blind to the truth even if you hit them in the face with it, and will always see anyone who speaks out against the state media points as &amp;amp;quot;Puting apologist&amp;amp;quot; or &amp;amp;quot;pro-dictator&amp;amp;quot; or whatever new trendy name is used for public shaming anyone who thinks outside the flock&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Shouldn’t ye be hoping it stays low for a couple of years so you can accumulate if you plan on never selling? Is it not ironic to plan on accumulating and hodling as much as possible while also hoping the price rises in the short term? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Tldr: a lot of people don’t know what they want, they want to get rich, but don’t exactly know how yet.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Actual real interest was closer to the 4-5% pa range and now it’s falling as we come closer to the implementation of ETH 2.0. I suspect we might actually see it hit ~1%. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The issue is you can’t unstake without sacrificing a whopping 4-10%, which is unfortunately considering there are so many better deals now for ETH deposits (CDC, for example, offers 4.5-6.5% on a 3 month term).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Moral Of The Story: Read the T&amp;amp;amp;Cs and don’t take a bad deal just because it’s the only deal you have in front of you. Remember that something better might come tomorrow!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Many of the questions posted here could be answered if you set up strict goals and following through with cashing out when you meet those goals.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Is your goal to 3x all your investments?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Good, once you achieve that take your profits and reassess.  Don’t get greedy and go for more.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Is your goal to hold certain coins for 3 years and then cash in?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Good, stick to it and follow through.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Is your goal to hold BTC and ETH forever and never sell?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Excellent, don’t get tempted to sell if it isn’t part of your pre planned goals.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Is your goals to YOLO all into ShitCoinInu and lose it all in record time?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Not the best strategy, but at least you stuck to it.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; /s&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The point is…&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;1) Make a plan.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;2) Follow through when the goal is met.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;3) Make a new plan and don’t have any regrets about the previous goals.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also, don’t set any of these goals while your drunk…&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Only a matter of time they drop it even more.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While personally, I still have no regrets as it forces me to hold and at time I didn&amp;amp;#39;t have a clue on hard wallets at the time, this is why you must read those tiny little letters when you agree to something (agreement details). Since learning a bit more, new ETH I have bought are stored elsewhere.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I knew this would happen eventually, but there are many people that click the agree button without reading the agreement and then blame the service.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So for those not staking yet, check your options. There are some that are better like Blockfi, Celsius and others which you don&amp;amp;#39;t have a lockup period and you can pull out as needed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As my crypto holdings have grown, I am becoming increasing afraid of my family not having access to these assets should I have an untimely death.  I search for a guide to give me family but could not find one, so I decided to make one.  This is a very long post and the coins and wallets are specific to me, but hopefully it will give others a good starting point.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you have any feedback, please share it so we can make the guide better and better.  I also posted the guide on my &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://greghamalian.substack.com/p/a-guide-to-accessing-crypto-after?s=w&quot;&amp;gt;substack&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and made it accessible to everyone.  I will be updating periodically with guides I receive from other people for their specific coins and holdings.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I know that so many of us have dreams of giving our family a better financial future, and our investments in crypto will not come to fruition if our keys die with us.  Please let me know what you think as I want to constantly improve this for others!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hello,&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At this point, I have been incapacitated to the point where I am unable to access my financial accounts.  At the time of writing, I have typical account with [banks, investments, etc].  I believe these accounts you will be access with proper documentation. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However, I also have funds in Cryptocurrencies.  These are a little more difficult to access, especially because some of the funds are stored on the blockchain.  This means there is no single entity holding the currencies and no department to call to get access to the account.  This presents an obvious challenge to getting funds I hold, which I will hopefully be able to describe how to access below.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The first thing you will need to know is that the coins/tokens are stored on the internet in a structure called the blockchain.  There is a public address (or public key) that is visible to everyone.  This is how the funds are verified as belonging to the address.  Think of this like as view-only permissions on a google document. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However, to move/send the funds and interact with the blockchain, one also needs to have the private key.  The private key is like having the email and password associated with the account that created the google document, so you can edit it.  A private key is generated from a set of words, called a seed phrase, and a key index.  If this is confusing, do not worry.  You will not need to understand all of it to access my tokens.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With all that said, the way you will get access to my tokens is through my seed phrase.  This is a set of words, either 12-, 15-, or 24- words long, which brings up my funds through a “wallet” on the blockchain. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Not to try to add too much complexity, but one token can have multiple wallets to access the chain.  However, for you, they will all work the same way.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Roughly speaking, my money is in a wallet on the blockchain.  To get access to the money, you need my seed phrase.  The seed phrase is critical. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;NEVER&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; give anyone the seed phrase to my accounts.  These seed phrases are kept in a secure location.  You will be able to find them when needed. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Under each coin I hold in a wallet, I will let you know exactly how to import the seed.  However, I first want to give you a general overview.  You will start by going to the foundation or company’s website.  See what wallet they recommend (unless I explicitly state a wallet I use for the coin).  You will download that wallet application.  When creating the wallet, you will select “Import from seed” or some similar phrase.  Do not create a new wallet.  You will enter the seed and see my wallet and funds. It will likely ask you to enter a spending password as well, or a PIN.  Do one you won’t forget.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Once you have access to the coins, you will need to transfer them to an exchange, then sell them on the exchange for dollars.  You can then transfer the dollars to whatever bank account you choose.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For the exchange, I recommend using primarily Coinbase.  This exchange is the simplest to understand and most user-friendly from an interface perspective.  I trust you will be able to create an account and connect the bank account.  I have funds on different exchanges as well.  The funds kept on exchanges will be easily accessible to you through my email and passwords.  You will know how to access this when the time comes. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now, while on Coinbase, you will need to click the “manage profile” button.  Under contact info, there will be a button that says “crypto addresses.”  Clicking this will allow you to create a wallet on Coinbase to send the money to. You will need to create an address for every coin I have for the transfer.  I will lay out each coin and the seed phrases for you to access, before describing how to do the transfer.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There are 3 different types of wallets that I have-&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;There is a custodial wallet.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;  This means another entity holds access to the keys/seed phrases. This is a wallet on an exchange (like Coinbase).  You will not need to do anything special here.  There are no special seed phrases to enter.  Simply my email, password, and 2FA will allow you to transfer.  The exchange will also have support for you to contact if I am incapacitated to help you get the money.  You can simply sell the through the exchange and transfer the funds to the bank.  The exchanges I have an account on are Coinbase, Binance.US, Gemini, and Crypto.com.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;There is a non-custodial, hot wallet.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;  This is a wallet online that you can access through the internet.  To access the tokens, you will have to go to a website and launch the application.  This often requires a download.  There are many scams out there, so please be careful.  The best way to access these wallets is to go to the official website of the foundation that launched the coin.  For example, the Algorand Token was launched by the Algorand Foundation.  One the foundation’s website, the recommend the Pera Wallet and MyAlgo Wallet.  Download these through the hyperlinks.  If you need any help, questions on the coins subreddit, and follow the recommendations of the people who answer publicly (do not respond to any direct messaging).  For this type of wallet, you’ll need to download the application, and then import my seed phrase for the wallet.  By entering the seed phrase, it will load the wallet that I created and stored value in.  It will ask you to create a spending password.  Pick whatever password you will remember as you will need to enter it to send the money out. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;There is a non-custodial, cold wallet.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;  This is a wallet where access to the funds are kept offline, but can be restored online whenever the wallet is actively being used.  The cold wallet I use is called a Ledger (made by a company called Ledger). For coins stored on my Ledger, you will need to download the Ledger Live App.  My ledger seed phrase is written on a metal plate and stored in my safety deposit box.  You will also be able to access my coins through the Ledger device.  This looks like a USB stick.  Through the Ledger Live App, you will have to send the coins to the exchange, while having the device nearby.  When the device is asks, you will need to confirm the transaction (push both buttons). &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I understand this may be a little confusing.  Read through a couple times, ask questions on Reddit, and watch YouTube videos.  It is a lot to take in initially, but it becomes easy once you try to figure it out.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At the time of writing, I own the following coins.  Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), Algorand (ALGO), Harmony (ONE), Nervos (CKB), Chainlink (LINK), and Stellar (XLM).  I will now tell you how to access each of these.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Bitcoin (BTC)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is stored through my cold-wallet Ledger.  You will use my Ledger Nano X and Ledger Live app to send to Coinbase (or whatever exchange you pick). The transfer usually takes 10-30 minutes.  Please do 2 separate transactions.  The first is a “test” transaction where you will send $5-$10 worth of BTC to the exchange.  Wait until it arrives before sending the remaining amount.  You will be charged a fee twice, but knowing it will arrive is worth it instead of sending all the money and not seeing it go through.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Ethereum (ETH)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is currently stored on custodial wallet, Coinbase.  I locked it up to earn interest.  I regret this decision currently.  Once the funds become available after they unlock, I will move my ETH to the Ledger.  Follow the steps for BTC to get it on an exchange.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;ETH swaps are anywhere from 5-30 minutes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Cardano (ADA)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My Cardano is currently stored through a Cardano hot-wallet.  The wallet I use is called Eternl.  You can access my tokens by importing my seed phrase on wallets such as Nami and Yoroi.  When you gain access to this account, the first thing you will need to do is claim my “staking” rewards and “undelegate” the ADA I am staking.  Staking is basically the interest I earned from having the tokens, and unstaking/undelegating is withdrawing that money. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You will also need to sell off additional tokens called “Cardano Native Assets.”  These are tokens that run on the Cardano system and have a value in ADA, but are not available on exchanges to cash out.  I will likely have tokens by the name of SUNDAE, DRIP, and FLICK.  To sell these tokens, search for a site called SundaeSwap.  You will need to connect the wallet, and on SundaeSwap you can exchange these assets for ADA.   Now, with that being said, you will likely pay a fee for each swap.  That is to be expected.  Just make sure the amount of ADA you receive is greater than the fee you will pay.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Once the native assets are swaps, send the ADA to the exchange.  Again, please do a test transaction first.  ADA transactions typically take 5-10 minutes to show up in the account. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Algorand (ALGO)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My Algorand is either kept in my Ledger cold wallet or in a MyAlgo hot wallet.  This is because some of the Algorand I use I lock up to earn interest (think like a bank-bond) and the other I use to participate in an activity called Decentralized Finance (DeFi).  The Algorand on the Ledger can be sent through the Ledger Live app exactly like Bitcoin. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Algorand I use in DeFi will be kept in a few places.  The first is right in the wallet.  This will be rare and there likely won’t be a lot of Algorand here.  There will be in what is called Liquidity Pools on a website called Tinyman.  To access Tinyman, you will first need to create a MyAlgo wallet and import my seed phrase.  You will go to app.tinyman.org and connect to the wallet.  Go to the tab that says “Pools” and with the LP Tokens.  You will then swap the assets that are not ALGO for ALGO using the same Tinyman site.  This is a similar process like you would have done for Cardano, it is just a different website but the same concept.  There are other areas of DeFi I participated in, but nothing at the moment.  If I start something new, I will update this sheet. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;ALGO swap are typically near-instant.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Harmony (ONE)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I keep my Harmony in a hot-wallet called MetaMask.  You will need to download the MetaMask Wallet application and import my seed phrase.  However, like with Cardano and Algorand, most of my ONE is used in DeFi.  The website I use is called OpenSwap.  You can find it at app.openswap.one.  To access my ONE, you will first need to “unstake” my ONE.  With ADA, when you unstake/undelegated, the ADA will be available immediately.  On Harmony, you will need to wait ~7 days for the money to unlock.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To unstake on openswap, click the “Farm” tab on the top of the page.  You will see my stake and many pairings.  There will be a line to that says “OpenSwap AutoCompound” and you can drop down details.  Do that, select unstake, and unstake the tokens.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To claim everything for the LPs, on the same page click the button that says “Only Show Staked Pools.” Select the details and unstake.  Like with ADA and ALGO, swap everything that isn’t ONE for ONE, and send to an exchange.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Please note that Coinbase does not have Harmony (ONE) available for trade.  The exchange Binance.US is probably the best site for this.  Another work around is to swap ONE for BTC and send the BTC to Coinbase.  However, this may be riskier is you cannot figure out how to send.  Definitely send a small test transaction first!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Harmony swaps are typically near instant.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Nervos (CKB)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is currently stored through the custodial wallet on Crypto.com.  I am hoping to move the CKB to my Ledger soon.  However, CKB is not traded on many exchanges, so a Crypto.com account might be the best way to get the money back.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I’ve yet to move CKB, and online I saw it could be anywhere from 5 minutes to hours.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Chainlink (LINK)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My Chainlink is stored on Coinbase.  However, I plan to move my LINK to a DeFi site soon.  I will update this once the move is made.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;LINK transaction time is ~5-10 minutes typically.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Stellar (XLM)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My Stellar is on Coinbase.  I likely will not have much Stellar.  I have a pre-loaded Coinbase Debit Card.  Basically, I frontload USD, and I get 4% XLM rewards back.  I frequently swap the XLM I earn for another cryptocurrency I own.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This will never be kept in a non-custodial wallet, but transaction times are near-instant.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hopefully that covers the entire process to get the funds I’ve been into crypto.  If you have questions, again, please go reddit and ask for help either in &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/cryptocurrency&quot;&amp;gt;r/cryptocurrency&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; or coin specific subreddits. NEVER share seed phrase and only follow advice people give publicly, not personal messages.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Following the news of Apes (bored ones) working with GME, market saw a rally around metaverse projects. Apecoin itself saw more than 15% rise in price (currently rank 86). Several other metaverse projects (like Axis infinity and its SLP, enjin, star Atlas) saw some nice gains too. it is very hard to say if it is just a phase or gonna have long lasting effect on the whole trend tho.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Altcoins also saw some long overdue rises. Carano saw almost 17% to the monthly high of 1.15$ which is by no mean near ATH of 3.09$ but still a source of joy for long time hodlers struggling with sluggish price action for several months now.
Other big gainers include: Dogecoin (14.6%) and Near(10.2%). &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Most alts are green today and most stablecoins are red. Just how we like it! (Unless you missed the last dip like me which is very very sad).
Market doesn&amp;amp;#39;t seem whiling to give up 2 trillion floor too. Which is a nice change of scenery to be honest. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In his official statement to the Russian press Vlad said &amp;amp;quot;my advisers say the Rouble is basically a shitcoin at this point. Whatever that means. So i asked them to DYOR. They reported back that they found the perfect solution. Shiba Inu. Whilst they say Shiba is the true shitcoin of the crypto world, apparently it is the second most volatile currency other than the Rouble. So it&amp;amp;#39;s basically an upgrade to the Rouble. As they say, a better shitcoin is better than a shitcoin&amp;amp;quot;!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After the announcement, Shiba Inu has shot up 3000 percent finally proving 14 year old kids right that Shib has mooned to a dollar.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The world is now coming to terms with the fact red bull chugging 14 year olds now control 95 percent of the world&amp;amp;#39;s wealth.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Is it because people expect the value to just 100X within the first month of holding it during the relative infancy of a project? Projects can take years and years to develop and grow. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In August of 2015, ETH was a little over $.70, and it took two years to get to $270. I&amp;amp;#39;m sure you&amp;amp;#39;re thinking, &amp;amp;quot;Oh, that&amp;amp;#39;s not long, I would have held. &amp;amp;quot;, but in the same breath, declare an alt dead after a few months. I&amp;amp;#39;m not saying every alt is destined for ETH&amp;amp;#39;s success, but I don&amp;amp;#39;t think we can predict their future success in such a short time. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I think some of these projects we all talk about, the good ones, can get up there, but I&amp;amp;#39;m ready to wait years to see it happen. More often than not, great success can be made on the back of failure. Projects will have growing pains; that&amp;amp;#39;s just the nature of business. Nothing goes straight up and stays up. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If the guy who sold his BTC for pizzas taught us anything, it&amp;amp;#39;s to have patience with our crypto and our projects. The ones who have restraint are the ones most handsomely rewarded.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
