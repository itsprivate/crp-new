It offers numerous services to cryptocurrency investors and other market players. According to DeFi LIama, the total locked-in value (TVL) in DeFi protocols today is $209.2 billion. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;From lending and borrowing to yield farming, from high APY staking protocols to margin trading, DeFi is ultimately transforming into one of the most desirable, go-to solutions for private investors, institutions, crypto VCs and retailers. With so many new, alternative value propositions being architected on almost a daily basis, DeFi is set to become the quintessential disruptor of 21st century finance. Due to its importance, this post will touch on an aspect of DeFi, which is lending. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cryptocurrency trading and speculation is at the heart of cryptocurrency lending. There is a high demand for cryptocurrency borrowing because hedge funds and a number of investors have found that they can make money by betting leveraged on tokens and crypto derivatives. Because these players can make significant amounts with their trading strategies, they can afford to pay intermediaries high rates for borrowing cryptocurrency. And today often a large number of investors and traders trade their assets in pair to stablecoins like Binance USD, Teather, USD Coin. These payments, net of profits, go to regular crypto investors in the form of returns that far exceed what they would get from bank deposits. Defi lending platforms aim to offer crypto loans in a trustless manner, i.e., without intermediaries. A borrower can directly take a loan through the decentralized platform. Among all of the decentralized applications (DApps), Defi has the highest lending growth rate and is the most prevalent contributor for locking crypto assets. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the past few years, the marketplace has seen even more valuable and innovative decentralized lending platforms. The ability to lend and borrow assets among completely open applications has created a fundamental breakthrough for the future of finance and cryptocurrency.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here are some of the topmost decentralized lending platforms you should know about.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;1. Aave&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is an open-source and one of the most popular Defi lending protocols launched in 2020. It is a non-custodial liquidity protocol for earning interests on deposit and borrowing assets. This platform allows lenders to deposit cryptocurrencies in a pool and receive an equivalent amount of aTokens. Aave algorithmically adjusts interest rates depending on demand and supply. It indicates that the more the user holds aTokens, the better the interest amount.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If users are looking to use the Aave protocol, users first deposit the chosen asset and amount. Shortly after, the lender will earn passive income based on the market borrowing demand. Additionally, depositing assets allows consumers the ability to borrow by using the deposited assets as collateral. The interest you earn by depositing funds may help offset the interest rate users accumulate by borrowing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/ja8uolr5a9t81.png?width=2880&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e7a711330665be2c031cdfd2876b5755ed0cd52b&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/ja8uolr5a9t81.png?width=2880&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e7a711330665be2c031cdfd2876b5755ed0cd52b&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Aave offers users many advantages. Financial protocols boast transparency, and that benefits many users. When it comes to lending and borrowing, everything is clear and straightforward, even for those new to the cryptocurrency market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You don&amp;amp;#39;t have to think about the processes we see in traditional systems that don&amp;amp;#39;t allow access to their processes. They use your funds in a way that benefits them, but they don&amp;amp;#39;t want to share the profits with you. However, Aave exposes your processes to your community so you know everything that&amp;amp;#39;s going on in the network.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some features of Aave:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;1) Aave is an open-source project&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The good thing about open source code is that many people look at it and work tirelessly to keep it free of vulnerabilities.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;2) Variety of credit pools&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can choose from 10 markets, each offering a different APY and a selection of different coins.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;3) Aave does not store cryptocurrencies&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This benefit is great for investors who worry about hackers. Because the protocol uses a &amp;amp;quot;non-storage&amp;amp;quot; approach to its transactions, users are safe. Even if a cybercriminal breaks into the network, he/she cannot steal the cryptocurrency because there is nothing to steal.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;4) Aave protocol is a private&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Like other decentralized protocols, Aave does not require KYC / AML (know your customer and anti-money laundering) filings. The platforms do not work with intermediaries. Thus, all of these processes become unnecessary. Users who keep their privacy above all else can invest in the platform without compromising themselves.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;2. Alchemix&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Alchemix is a DeFi loan-based platform that uses a new method to provide loans that “pay themselves back over time.” Users deposit DAI into a smart contract. In exchange, users receive a token that represents the deposit’s future yield farming potential. The token used through Alchemix is known as alUSD, which can be transmuted for DAI within the Alchemix platform and traded on a given DeFi exchange.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Once funds are deposited, the funds are used to generate income, which will eventually automatically repay the user&amp;amp;#39;s debt . However, there are several ways in which the user can manage their credit:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Option 1: leave their deposit to earn income all the time, allowing them to periodically withdraw the collateral on the loan.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Option 2: Repay the loan early using alUSD or DAI, allowing them to remove the collateral&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Option 3: liquidate their loan using some of their collateral to pay off the loan and allow them to withdraw what&amp;amp;#39;s left.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/ka1tsx87a9t81.png?width=2880&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=a91fd31a92344396486ffa624efbaa5c5c3adff1&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/ka1tsx87a9t81.png?width=2880&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=a91fd31a92344396486ffa624efbaa5c5c3adff1&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;V1 provided users with a single source of income limiting repayment options. Alchemix version 2 is continually expanding the range of yield options available, making it a key lego in the DeFi stack. If a new app comes along that offers competitive returns, we will be able to quickly capture it, which will be mutually beneficial for both us and the protocol we integrate.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In addition, v2 gives users the ability to determine in detail which yield strategies support their loans, allowing them to create their own yield aggregators on top of Alchemix. More conservative investors can choose safer and more stable yield options, while more aggressive investors may prefer to take more risk by choosing other, less established options with highly variable rates.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some Theses and Features of Alchemix Finance: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;1) Alchemix Synthetic Stablecoin (alUSD)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When users deposit DAI into the Alchemix platform, they receive alUSD in return. As per security measures on the platform, there are limits in place on the amount of alUSD that can be minted from DAI assets.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;2) Vaults&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At the heart of the Alchemix Finance protocol are the vaults, operating through smart contracts. At the moment there are 4 vaults with stablecoins. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;3) Pegging mechanism for synthetic tokens&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All harvested yield flows through the Transmuter, which helps maintain a guaranteed redemption of 1:1 for alUSD and DAI. Moreover, users can choose to stake the synthetic stablecoin in the Transmuter, which will automatically convert yield into the base asset (DAI). When staked, alUSD acts like a bond, eventually maturing into a base asset. When users decide to withdraw their converted DAI, the protocol burns an equivalent amount of the Alchemix stablecoin, alUSD.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;4) Alchemix DAO&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Alchemix decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is a community of enthusiasts working collaboratively to grow and develop the Alchemix ecosystem. The DAO also receives funding through the yield generated through the Alchemix protocol, split between the treasury funds. Whereas the treasury fund is responsible for covering the finances of operations, the Alchemix DAO focuses its funding on development. However, any movement of funds is subject to governance from the DAO. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;3. WOWswap&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;WOWswap is a fully community-owned protocol based on a simple idea: liquidity providers can create a liquidity pool, and traders can borrow these funds to buy up to 5 times more tokens. It is built on Ethereum, Solana, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Binance Smart Chain, IoTeX, Polygon and HECO Chain. Protocol fees, interest rates for lenders and borrowers, liquidation ratios and other settings are decided by holders of WOW tokens — our governance token. Making a WOW swap is as easy as making a regular swap on Uniswap or Pancakeswap — extra capital will be automatically borrowed from the liquidity pool.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When a trader opens a leveraged trading position (long or short), the trader takes a loan from the liquidity pool at a current Hourly Interest Rate (HIR). Therefore, to make leveraged trading possible Liquidity Providers (LP) need to maintain enough liquidity in liquidity pools. Anyone can become a liquidity provider by supplying liquidity to the liquidity pools.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/bidfz9v8a9t81.png?width=2880&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=feef161a9900abcaa9690523e824fdc7ba01fc27&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/bidfz9v8a9t81.png?width=2880&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=feef161a9900abcaa9690523e824fdc7ba01fc27&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Into the second half of 2021, WOWswap had already accomplished much of its initial roadmap, including a liquidation bot, instant governance, a recruitment smart contract, enabled leveraged short swaps, and worked out a DAO governance model. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As a way of maximum capitalization of yields, the platform launched an effective yield aggregator that would allow yield farmers to farm rewards on other DeFi protocols. This is because just a handful of pool tokens are active, while over 75% of the rest remain inactive.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For the platform to improve efficiency around the yield aggregator, the platform will take in rewards from more than one protocol. As a matter of fact, the platform favors highly secure protocols as a means of ensuring funds are protected from cyber terrorists. Remember, DeFi protocols have lost around $14 million to hackers within the last year. Hence, security is paramount to any trading protocol.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The development team found it ideal to allow yield farmers to lend a percentage of their dormant assets and reap more rewards. Thereby, boosting the APY from 10% or 15% to 50%. This implies that traders on WOWswap will gain 50% more in APR compared to other leverage trading protocols.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Besides, the protocol also plans to allow users to burn their tokens and gain rewards.  By executing a successful leverage position on the platform, traders will pay a fee that will automatically represent their vote in community governance. While the fees were currently held in the treasury, presently, they are staked to allow for decentralized voting. Meanwhile, the rest of the tokens are distributed to holders of xWOW.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;WOWswap has a number of features and advantages over competitors:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;1) Successful audit by Hacken&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These audit results showed that there were no critical points in the original smart contract they released and highlighted a few more measures that they took to decrease their already low risks to the barest minimum.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;2) Over 200+ coins for making deals &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Lend your coins to traders and receive reward in the form of interest payments of their trades and also you can open long and short positions yourself using leverage up to 5x. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;3) WOWswap Alerts&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;High APY Alerts, that alert WOWswap users when any of the tokens in the lending pool accumulates 20, 50, or 100% profits. This helps get insights on the most profitable pools to lend to.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;4) WOW Governance Model&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Governance is a mechanism, through which holders of WOW-token can change important protocol’s parameters, as well as submit and accept WOW improvement proposals. Everyone, who participates in the Governance, receives Governance rewards, which calculated as a percentage of the protocol’s total revenue.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;5) xWOW token&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;xWOW token is used for voting and Governance reward distribution. Governance rewards are distributed proportionally among all xWOW holders. Staking by itself is sufficient to get Governance rewards, no actual voting is required.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Conclusion&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This detailed discussion shows that DeFi lending has a high potential to reshape the entire financial system. DeFi lending being involved with the intriguing technology truly has vast opportunities to revolutionize the global financial landscape.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Additionally a pool operator has been reviewing code and running nodes on testnet and in their opinion The Merge probably won&amp;amp;#39;t be ready until 2023:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://np.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/comments/u2cty5/confirmation_that_the_merge_is_delayed/i4hz8pe/&quot;&amp;gt;https://np.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/comments/u2cty5/confirmation_that_the_merge_is_delayed/i4hz8pe/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s not wholly unexpected as development always tends to run a little later than original estimates, and it&amp;amp;#39;s also not a bad thing that they are going to take their time to make sure everything goes as smoothly as possible.  This is also not FUD, as anyone who is following the progress on tesnet can attest to there have been many major advances towards The Merge in the last several months.  It&amp;amp;#39;s kind of a running theme in the ETH mining community how proof of stake has been &amp;amp;quot;almost here&amp;amp;quot; for years now, but this time it&amp;amp;#39;s actually true we are nearing the end.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Edit:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; To the folks saying I &amp;amp;quot;made this up&amp;amp;quot; or am spreading FUD or whatever, I&amp;amp;#39;m just posting info to help keep cc up to date with the latest from a prominent ETH developer.  I like ETH, think it&amp;amp;#39;s a great project, and am interested in its development.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) increased 1.2 percent in March on a seasonally adjusted basis after rising 0.8 percent in February, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Over the last 12 months, the all items index increased 8.5 percent before seasonal adjustment.   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Increases in the indexes for gasoline, shelter, and food were the largest contributors to the seasonally adjusted all items increase. The gasoline index rose 18.3 percent in March and accounted for over half of the all items monthly increase; other energy component indexes also increased. The food index rose 1.0 percent and the food at home index rose 1.5 percent.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The index for all items less food and energy rose 0.3 percent in March following a 0.5-percent increase the prior month. The shelter index was by far the biggest factor in the increase, with a broad set of other indexes also contributing, including those for airline fares, household furnishings and operations, medical care, and motor vehicle insurance. In contrast, the index for used cars and trucks fell 3.8 percent over the month.    &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The all items index continued to accelerate, rising 8.5 percent for the 12 months ending March, the largest 12-month increase since the period ending December 1981. The all items less food and energy index rose 6.5 percent, the largest 12-month change since the period ending August 1982. The energy index rose 32.0 percent over the last year, and the food index increased 8.8 percent, the largest 12-month increase since the period ending May 1981.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sounds like tomorrow&amp;amp;#39;s CPI reading is going to be painful. I&amp;amp;#39;m having a hard time understanding how &amp;amp;quot;we are in a better place than we were last month&amp;amp;quot; and yet headline inflation is also going to be &amp;amp;quot;extraordinarily elevated.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Full article text:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;by Christian Datoc, White House Reporter  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Biden administration is bracing for inflation to continue its historic rise when the March Consumer Price Index is published Tuesday morning.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters in Monday&amp;amp;#39;s briefing that while &amp;amp;quot;we are in a better place than we were last month,&amp;amp;quot; the administration expects &amp;amp;quot;headline inflation to be extraordinarily elevated due to Putin&amp;amp;#39;s price hike.&amp;amp;quot;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Psaki noted that the previous CPI report did not factor in jumps in energy prices brought about by the war in Ukraine but stressed that the United States is in &amp;amp;quot;a better place than we were last month.&amp;amp;quot;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;We expect a large difference between core and headline inflation, reflecting the global disruptions in energy and food markets,&amp;amp;quot; she continued. &amp;amp;quot;Of course, we know that core inflation, energy, the impact of energy, of course, on oil prices, gas prices — we expect that to continue to reflect what we&amp;amp;#39;ve seen the increases be over the course of this invasion.&amp;amp;quot;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Furthermore, Psaki used the opportunity to push Congress to pass the remainder of President Joe Biden&amp;amp;#39;s economic agenda and &amp;amp;quot;reduce costs for the American people.&amp;amp;quot;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;We have, of course, legislation that could do exactly that and cut the cost of childcare, of healthcare, of elder care,&amp;amp;quot; she stated. &amp;amp;quot;These all have enormous impacts on people&amp;amp;#39;s budgets, on when they&amp;amp;#39;re doing those calculations at their kitchen table, and certainly, this data will be a reminder of the need to do something and take additional steps.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now that we know for sure when it will hit $100k, it&amp;amp;#39;s time to take out a loan whilst being unemployed and FOMO it all into Bitcoin. Not only that, but let&amp;amp;#39;s talk to everyone we know and convince them to FOMO all their money in Bitcoin. What could go wrong, we have the word of experts. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Honestly though, I&amp;amp;#39;m already seeing articles about how Bitcoin will hit $100k by the end of 2022 and it feels like the same thing again that happened last year, namely, people expecting crazy gains because Bitcoin has moved up like 5%. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And this again will cause people invest in Bitcoin and expect to be rich by the end of the year, which is very unlikely, so they&amp;amp;#39;ll definitely be disappointed. I would say that we shouldn&amp;amp;#39;t really care how much Bitcoin will be this week, this month, or even this year. Why look at short term? Not like short term works with Bitcoin, because it&amp;amp;#39;s become a little stable compared to alts, and even they&amp;amp;#39;re not as volatile anymore to get you a lot of profits short term. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitcoin won&amp;amp;#39;t get you rich Short term, it&amp;amp;#39;s best to have patience and invest and wait. No, Waiting doesn&amp;amp;#39;t mean checking the charts every second of the day, simply DCA if you already do or forget about your investment. Patience does pay off.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The core contributors of Hedera are focused on building functionalities, services, and developer tooling to support the same types of applications being funded by the HBAR Foundation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One of the most exciting things about building on Hedera right now is that the DeFi ecosystem is just getting started with the re-introduction of &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://hedera.com/blog/unblocking-and-unloading-the-speed-secrets-behind-hedera-smart-contracts-2-0&quot;&amp;gt;optimized Smart Contracts&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; — there are 750k+ account holders looking to use $HBAR and builders of NFT and DeFi applications will be the first ones to give them this opportunity. We’ve already seen significant organic growth in NFT marketplaces, browser wallet support, and related projects.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Hedera Apps&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hedera is home to hundreds of projects in the web3 space — here’s a &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bmgentile/status/1404570788951326724&quot;&amp;gt;tweet thread&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; outlining a few of those larger applications. Additionally, full case studies can be found &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hedera.com/users&quot;&amp;gt;here&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As HBAR Foundation ecosystem grants ramp up, we’ll begin to see massive development of retail-focused applications coming to Hedera, such as these ones available today:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;NFT marketplaces like &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://zuse.market/&quot;&amp;gt;Zuse&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://hashaxis.com/&quot;&amp;gt;HashAxis&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, and &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://launch.turtlemoon.io/&quot;&amp;gt;Turtlemoon&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Wallets with transaction signing like &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hashpack.app/&quot;&amp;gt;HashPack&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.venly.io/&quot;&amp;gt;Venly&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Network bridges like &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hashport.network/&quot;&amp;gt;HashPort&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Staking delegation apps like &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://hedera.staderlabs.com/&quot;&amp;gt;StaderLabs&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All of which have been built organically by the Hedera developer community.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Smart Contract Hackathon | Now - May 16th | $500k+ in prizes&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hedera is hosting a &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://hedera22.devpost.com/&quot;&amp;gt;Solidity smart contract hackathon&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; through May 16th with over $500k in prizes to be earned for building DeFi, DAO, NFT, and Payment focused applications.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Upcoming Milestones&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The product and ecosystem roadmap for Hedera can be found at &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://hedera.com/roadmap&quot;&amp;gt;https://hedera.com/roadmap&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A few things we’re especially excited about:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Community-run network nodes&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Staking of HBAR on Hedera (&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-improvement-proposal/blob/master/HIP/hip-406.md&quot;&amp;gt;HIP-406&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Developer tooling (web3.js and ethers.js support)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Social&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;________________________________________________________________________________________________________________&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Myths to Dispel&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Myth #1: Hashgraph consensus and Hedera’s services are proprietary&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Hedera’s network services, officially supported SDKs, and every developer tool is open source under an Apache 2.0 license. Hashgraph consensus &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://cointelegraph.com/news/hedera-governing-council-to-buy-hashgraph-ip-and-open-source-projects-code&quot;&amp;gt;will be open source this year&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; under an Apache 2.0 license. You can find the Hedera project’s GitHub here: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hashgraph/&quot;&amp;gt;https://github.com/hashgraph/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Myth #2: Developers building dapps on Hedera can’t contribute to the project&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://hips.hedera.com/&quot;&amp;gt;Hedera Improvement Proposals (HIPs)&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; include core protocol changes, as well as changes to the applications, frameworks, and protocols built on top of the Hedera public network and used by the community.The &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://hips.hedera.com/&quot;&amp;gt;goal of HIPs&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; is to have a place for everyone to propose new features, collect community thoughts and input on a particular issue, document all subject matters in one place, and provide a status on their implementation. You can view all of the HIPs and contribute here: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://hips.hedera.com/all.html&quot;&amp;gt;https://hips.hedera.com/all.html&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Myth #3: Hedera is a private, permissioned network for Enterprises&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The Hedera network is a public network infrastructure for everyone to anonymously create accounts and build decentralized applications on, without telling anyone who they are or performing KYC/AML.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The Hedera network today is operated by members of the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://hedera.com/council&quot;&amp;gt;governing council&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; — each of the 26 members independently operates and maintains an individual node in their own data center or public cloud, ensuring full decentralization of consensus. This year, Hedera is allowing for community nodes — any member of the Hedera community can independently operate a node and earn &amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://hedera.com/hbar&quot;&amp;gt;$HBAR&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. And in the future, the entire network will be permissionless. Read the “path to permissionless” whitepaper &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://hedera.com/hh-decentralization-of-consensus.pdf&quot;&amp;gt;here&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Myth #4: Hedera doesn&amp;amp;#39;t have performant smart contracts&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Hedera’s smart contracts 2.0 is an implementation of the Besu EVM (Solidity) that has been optimized for the Hedera network and hashgraph consensus. Solidity-based smart contracts on Hedera off the following benefits:

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;No congestion fees for gas  / all txn fees are fixed (&amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hedera.com/fees&quot;&amp;gt;www.hedera.com/fees&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;15 million gas / second&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;300+ txns / second&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Integration with the native Token Service on Hedera mapped to ERC-20, 721, 1155 standards, 10k txns per second, and $0.0001 txn fees.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Getting started with Hedera: A guide for devs and degens&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Developer Quickstart&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The easiest way as a developer to get started building on Hedera is by checking out the official Hedera documentation at &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.hedera.com/&quot;&amp;gt;https://docs.hedera.com/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and getting a testnet account from &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://portal.hedera.com/&quot;&amp;gt;https://portal.hedera.com&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; — we have &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.hedera.com/guides/docs/sdks&quot;&amp;gt;officially-supported SDKs&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; available in Java, Javascript, and Go.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.hedera.com/guides/getting-started/environment-set-up&quot;&amp;gt;Set up your environment&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Try &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.hedera.com/guides/getting-started/try-examples&quot;&amp;gt;examples&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.hedera.com/guides/resources/tutorials&quot;&amp;gt;tutorials&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, and &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.hedera.com/guides/resources/demo-applications&quot;&amp;gt;demo applications&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://hedera.com/discord&quot;&amp;gt;Join the developer community on Discord&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Degen Quickstart&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As a self-proclaimed degenerate holding $HBAR, you have opportunities to use that $HBAR for things like staking, minting, buying, and selling NFTs, and participating in DeFi applications.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Install the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hashpack.app/post/how-to-create-your-first-account-with-hashpack&quot;&amp;gt;HashPack&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; browser wallet extension on Chrome: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hashpack.app/post/how-to-create-your-first-account-with-hashpack&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.hashpack.app/post/how-to-create-your-first-account-with-hashpack&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Check out the various applications on Hedera of which you can connect to via HashPack: NFT marketplaces (over 400+ NFT projects and over $4M USD in aggregate transactions) like &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://zuse.market/&quot;&amp;gt;Zuse&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://hashaxis.com/&quot;&amp;gt;HashAxis&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, and &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://launch.turtlemoon.io/&quot;&amp;gt;Turtlemoon&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, network bridges to and from Ethereum and Polygon via &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hashport.network/&quot;&amp;gt;HashPort&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, and staking delegation apps like &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://hedera.staderlabs.com/&quot;&amp;gt;StaderLabs&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Edit on the title:  The funding allocated to the HBAR Foundation consisted of 5 billion hbars (approximately 10% of total supply), currently worth US $1 billion as of September 16th, 2021.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As you can see by the technical analysis and illustration above of Bitcoin&amp;amp;#39;s history, it is going down to 0. Considering the trend analysis above, you should all sell your Bitcoin before it hits 0. Do NOT zoom out, only look at 1D or 7D charts when reviewing Bitcoins history, otherwise you may say silly things like &amp;amp;quot;its literally just flat month over month lul&amp;amp;quot; or &amp;amp;quot;historically this same move has happened hundreds of times&amp;amp;quot; or &amp;amp;quot;bruh this isn&amp;amp;#39;t even a dip lol&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;IGNORE ALL THAT - Just focus on what makes you feel scared and worried about your decisions. See all that red below? RED BAD. Its gone down THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN ONE DAY. By my math, it will be zero in just a few more days.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now that I have educated you - Please sell your bitcoin. Act on that fear and worry, and I will even do you a favor.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My first experience with Crypto was when someone from a different country sent me $100 fund to support for a business i proposed. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;LESN 1. Crypto closes the location gap for funding useful projects.
&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Few months after my first exposure, Bitcoin dropped from 10k to 4k. It took some time, but it came back up, now around 40k+&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;LESN 2. The market is very volatile, have faith or go home safely.
&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Later on, I decided to invest in Alt coins, i asked a knowledgeable friend for suggestions, and he suggested &amp;amp;quot;Coin X&amp;amp;quot; (name undisclosed).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I invested in Coin X a little and it showed signs of growth in the first few weeks. Not so long Coin X dipped, came back up then dipped again. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;LESN 3. Spare money is your safety net.
&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A few times, i tried swapping my initial investment between markets to Chase my losses. Ultimately lost on them too.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;LESN 4. You can&amp;amp;#39;t time the market, switching in between investments/markets can dip you into more losses than your initial.

LESN 5. It&amp;amp;#39;s just money, don&amp;amp;#39;t get attached to coins, it&amp;amp;#39;s not your religion and its not saving the world. if you lose your money there wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t be pity for you by the creators.
&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So i started receiving crypto payment for my freelance while looking for a day job. I hedl as an alternative to cashing out. The crash came and my assets are worth about 30% of the actual amount i got paid. Reminded me of LESN 3 and&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;LESN 6. DYOR doesn&amp;amp;#39;t mean you will not lose your money.
&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Finally.  Work in real life with your value skills, budget some of your savings for crypto. That way, losses hit you less and you&amp;amp;#39;d have the strength to continue (if you have to).

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We have to show the other side as well and remind people that the opposite is also true, as $420.69 million was liquidated in just 24 hours.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;$300 million was wiped just from BTC, ETH, LUNA, SOL, DOGE and NEAR.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

This is a copy/paste I found interesting and wanted to see how a maxi would form a rebuttal. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;————————————————————&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The most critical flaw in Bitcoin is its lack of privacy. If you give me your Bitcoin wallet address so that I can send you a payment, you immediately compromise your privacy. I can see as a matter of public record how much money you have in your Bitcoin wallet (there are messy workarounds to attempt to fix this problem, which we will address shortly). The same situation applies even if you are the one sending Bitcoin. Any recipient can then see how much money you have in your Bitcoin wallet, both now and in perpetuity. To understand how critical this privacy problem is, consider the following scenarios:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You are travelling through parts of a country with a medium to high violent crime rate. You need to use some of your Bitcoin to pay for something. If every person you transact with knows exactly how much money you have, this is a threat to your personal physical safety.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You are a business that receives a payment from a supplier. That supplier will be able to see how much money your business has, and therefore can guess at how price sensitive you are in future negotiations. They can see every single other payment you’ve ever received to that Bitcoin address, and therefore determine what other suppliers you are dealing with and how much you are paying those suppliers. They may be able to roughly determine how many customers you have and how much you charge your customers. This is commercially sensitive information that damages your negotiating position enough to cause you relative financial loss.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You are a private citizen paying for online goods and services. You are aware that it is common practice for companies to attempt to use ‘price discrimination’ algorithms to attempt to determine the highest prices they can offer future services to you at, and you would prefer they do not have the information advantage of knowing how much you spend and where you spend it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You sell cupcakes and receive Bitcoin as payment. It turns out that someone who owned that Bitcoin before you was involved in criminal activity. Now you are worried that you have become a suspect in a criminal case, because the movement of funds to you is a matter of public record. You are also worried that certain Bitcoins that you thought you owned will be considered ‘tainted’ and that others will refuse to accept them as payment.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;————————————————————&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Have a great day and remember no hate. This is just an opportunity to teach/learn/discuss.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Imo if you have to come to this level to make your point, you have already lost. This does nothing but fuel more hate, anger, resentment towards crypto bros, especially when so many are working towards making crypto inclusive to all irrespective of their financial conditions, yet prime spots are being given to clowns who shred USD bills. 13% of Americans live below the poverty line, 74% of Africans live below the poverty line.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Not only is it a shitty way to make any argument, it is also illegal - Section 33 of US Criminal Code prohibits defacement of currency notes with jail term for offenders. Exhibitions like Bitcoin Conference are giving airtime and promoting clowns who act in utter defiance of established laws. Im sure this is gonna go down well with all those who already accuse crypto of enabling criminals. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitcoin exist since 2009.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitcoin first transaction happened in May 2010, 16 months after its creation. We are talking about Bitcoin when its price was less then a cent.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Right now, I still don&amp;amp;#39;t see a massige global adoption, but I believe that it is coming.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto is a young space, vast majority of crypto coins in top100 are less then five years old.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This kind of investment is a little bit hard to understand for a lot of people, that is why maybe we don&amp;amp;#39;t see growth as much as we hope. Or we are just expecting too much way too fast. Crypto is complicated and we can all agree on that. So were other technologies in the begining.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Advanced technologies like &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;internet&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; are good example. Internet was invented in 1983.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In 1993 we had around 14 million users of internet worldwide.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In 1994 we had around 25 million users worldwide.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In 1995 we had around 44 million users worldwide.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I said worldwide? Actually, most of these users were from America btw.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Those are low numbers considering what we have today almost 5 billion users (at least devices) on internet. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This also shows that often it takes many years for people to start adopting new technologies. You know, back in the days there was no web browsers. To start using internet you had to type commands on some ugly black and white, or green screen.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Today, we have more then 300 million people that used or are still using crypto in some way, while 18,000 business are accepting them as a form of payment - &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://triple-a.io/crypto-ownership/&quot;&amp;gt;Source.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;According to data acquired by Finbold, about 10.2 percent of the global population using the internet owns some form of cryptocurrency - &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theportugalnews.com/news/2022-02-14/10-of-the-global-population-owns-cryptocurrency/65227&quot;&amp;gt;news source&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So basically, crypto users are growing globally fast. Maybe just not fast as you would like to.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Take a look at this chart I found on the web, it shows that the crypto has the fastest rate of adoption compared to other technologies in our world.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/mm0inikgdss81.png?width=934&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=bf750bc5d5b99e92aff724a207e092a1fc6d2e95&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/mm0inikgdss81.png?width=934&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=bf750bc5d5b99e92aff724a207e092a1fc6d2e95&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The way I see it, people are talking it is &amp;amp;quot;too late&amp;amp;quot; because they don&amp;amp;#39;t believe that they will see massive gains if they invest $1000 in BTC. Well, you probably won&amp;amp;#39;t get rich with it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adopting a new technology is not a walk in the park, that is why a lot of us here says &amp;amp;quot;be patient&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There is more then 16,000 cryptocurrencies today, and if we take a look at 2017 we will see that a lot of them went really down, or really dead.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It probably is going to happen again with a lot of cryptocurrencies.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It will take time, but the way I see it, you are not late, crypto is yet to come, and I don&amp;amp;#39;t really think that this can be stopped.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you start investing today you are still early, but not too early. You are 100% not late.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Immediately after the event, a branch of the central bank RBI issued a strange statement:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/radhbvkqwrs81.jpg?width=1448&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=b12fd2a4ec8dc631a5cc6439a7914836c2f1acfd&quot;&amp;gt;They are not aware of any crypto exchange using UPI&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As a result, it seems Coinbase has wound up its operations within just 3 days.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/coinbase-halts-upi-payments-for-crypto-within-three-days-of-india-launch-122041100027_1.html&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/coinbase-halts-upi-payments-for-crypto-within-three-days-of-india-launch-122041100027_1.html&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto continues to be discriminated, but you can use UPI on a host of gambling apps where people are way more likely to lose all of their money. The odds of winning in a gambling app is terribly low, even if it is disguised as fantasy sports. Some utterly shitty games like Rummy are supported on UPI.. but investing in crypto is blocked lol. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Such decisions show that UPI can never be a real global settlement layer. If legit businesses like Coinbase can be kicked off at will, it is not a neutral settlement layer. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;RBI is a strong opponent of crypto and has hit out multiple times against crypto with latest attacks referencing outdated claims from 2013.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
