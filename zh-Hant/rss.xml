How not to fall for them. What to do if you have fallen for one. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/s6xtxm/the_scammer_who_received_the_single_largest/&quot;&amp;gt;I made a promise with intentions to keep it.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; There were money people who commented on my post saying that they have fallen for a scam. Hope this post can help :p&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Doubling scam&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Scam type 1 is the doubling scam. It turns out many newbies and even hardened veterans have fallen for these scams. The highest amount someone reported on my previous post was 11ETH(worth $33000)! They promptly deleted their comment so I will not be able to reveal their identity.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How does the scam work:-&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s a YouTube live video with 12-20K viewers. It is most likely a conference where famous people like Elon Musk or Jack Dorsey or Vitalik Buterin or CZ from Binance are present.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/mstzh88jvnc81.jpg?width=2340&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=4905037359f4572ac6902649c5635ee566d0c47f&quot;&amp;gt;Here is a screenshot. Shout out to u/fashion_hunger for the screenshot. Thank you so much!&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Looks pretty legit and official, right? CZ himself being present to conduct a giveaway? Well, it&amp;amp;#39;s not. As you can see that they require you to send crypto to their wallet to receive the double amount. It&amp;amp;#39;s a total scam!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How not to fall for it :-&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you visit their &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://2022-bnb.com/&quot;&amp;gt;website&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, there are three options. The first is BNB, the second is ETH and the third is BTC. Suppose you choose BTC, it will take you to another &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://2022-bnb.com/btc/index.html&quot;&amp;gt;page&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. If you scroll down you&amp;amp;#39;ll see this-&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/mu01atm2wnc81.png?width=2692&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=5523368e2862a719ff89eb721081552d0ede1eaa&quot;&amp;gt;The website claims that there are transactions happening every minute. This is just a screenshot of a few supposed transactions. There are multiple websites like this one, and their UI is just copy paste.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So there are supposedly transactions happening every minute. Well here&amp;amp;#39;s the catch, if you copy the address and search it on &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blockchain.com/&quot;&amp;gt;blockchain.com&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; you&amp;amp;#39;ll see that there have been only 2 transactions using this address. The website claims that there transactions happening every second, but in reality there are only 2 transactions linked with the wallet. So you can conclude that its a total scam! A little research and a simple tool is enough to conclude that this is totally a scam.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Fake miner/investment&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A user reached out to me(unfortunately he had fallen for the scam and lost $230), he shared some websites with me and chose to stay anonymous. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://alphacoins.net/&quot;&amp;gt;Like this one for instance.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; Pretty legit looking website. Got that google translate option as well.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How does the scam work :-&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So supposedly they are running a cloud mining operation. Someone would most likely contact you on platforms like telegram, the scammer posing as someone else. They&amp;amp;#39;ll tell you about how they made money with the mining operation. So you are somewhat convinced and you visit their website. Now the website has multiple &amp;amp;quot;plans&amp;amp;quot; which give different returns and have different minimums and maximums. And all of is just to make the operation seem legit. So you have invested in one of the plan and it shows you that the mining is in progress. When the supposed mining is done, you would obviously try to withdraw your money and here is when the problem starts. They will send you a mail saying that you need to migrate to another plan to withdraw funds, and to migrate to the other plan, you need to pay them more money. So they are just trying to milk you for more. Obviously you would go back to the person who first contacted you with your problem. They&amp;amp;#39;ll say that after migrating they were able to withdraw funds and send a bullshit confirmation like this as proof-&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/6zolxbq9wnc81.jpg?width=634&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=1fa27511f2dec51c6cc3c5b4cafb3436d0995d34&quot;&amp;gt;The proof sent by the scammer. Yes, Martha Lopez is a scammer.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I guess by now you have realised that you have fallen for a scam. And did I forget to mention that the user shared almost 4-6 websites, all similar, all claiming to be cloud mining operations. Some claimed that they are based in the UK and are listed as well. As I said, its all copy paste material.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How not to fall for it :-&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Well you&amp;amp;#39;ll have to do a little digging. Like in this instance, the scammers website claims that they are based in 80 Bendemeer Road, Singapore and are a listed company in Singapore as well. So I looked up 80 Bendemeer Road, Singapore and found the contact info of the building owners. I contacted them and asked if they have any company named Alphacoins as a tenant. Here is their reply-&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/9xgmttkewnc81.png?width=764&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=1dac270b38b33363aba6deae45bd39101d195598&quot;&amp;gt;No tenant named Alphacoins. It took the owners only 20 minutes to reply.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They have no tenant named as Alphacoins in 80 Bendemeer Road, Singapore. The owners replied to my mail in less than 20 mins. I wrote a professional e- mail, I never thought that I&amp;amp;#39;ll ever need to write a professional e-mail. And here I am doing it for you guys. A little digging can help you uncover their blatant lies and protect your money.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;What to do if you have fallen for one? :-&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Ok, you have fallen for a scam. What do you do now? The advice I am going to give is not original. It is from another &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/&quot;&amp;gt;r/CryptoCurrency&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; user I cannot remember(seriously please DM for credit).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The best you can do is inform the authorities and keep a track of your fund, meaning keep a track of where the scammer is transferring your crypto to. When the scammer transfers his crypto to a CEX, you&amp;amp;#39;ll be able to contact the exchange and get that scammer caught. Most exchanges require KYC so there is a chance that authorities are able to retrieve your crypto and identify the scammer(I can&amp;amp;#39;t remember the user who gave this advice, so if you are lurking, please contact me for credit.).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But there is a possibility that you are not able to recover your funds, best you can do in that case is save others by reporting the scammer and their wallet on sites like &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://scam-alert.io/&quot;&amp;gt;scam alert&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; or &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bitcoinabuse.com/&quot;&amp;gt;bitcoin abuse.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; There is a good chance that someone might visit these website&amp;amp;#39;s and search for the address that scammed you and save their money.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Conclusion :-&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I really hope this post is able to help you, I know I haven&amp;amp;#39;t covered all the possible scams. There are too many!! And each is more complicated then the other!!! But the 2 I have explained should be enough to give you a idea of what most scams look like and how you can save your funds. Hope this post is able to help :-)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Social media platforms and streaming services run on huge server networks that consume way more energy than the crypto mining farms. Yet crypto gets all the hate? 
It&amp;amp;#39;s especially stupid because banning the mining of crypto won&amp;amp;#39;t have any impact on the environment at all because people with mining rigs won&amp;amp;#39;t just pull the plug on them and call it a day. No, they will repurpose them for other uses like cloud computing, neural network training or even (cloud)gaming.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

There are more WallStreet paper claims to gold (&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;future contacts and whatnot&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;) than actual gold, so WallStreet and central banks just &amp;amp;#39;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;trade/swap&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#39; these claims back and forth with each other all buddy buddy. WallStreet controls most of the actual gold in the world, not individuals with the paper claims.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Similarly, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;there are more paper claims to Bitcoin than actually Bitcoin thanks to leverage, margins, futures trading, and ETFs; WallStreet is applying their same debt-based paper system to the equity based (real value) crypto asset Bitcoin as they do to suppress gold price.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; So for every Bitcoin on the block chain, 10, 50, 100 people could have a &amp;amp;#39;claim&amp;amp;#39; to that Bitcoin. Legit the 0.01btc I look at on my CoinBase could be the &amp;amp;#39;same&amp;amp;#39; one you look at due to lack of CEX transparency and oversight of their lending practices! This means there is an artificially larger supply of Bitcoin in circulation; and we all know &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;price is a supply and demand equation!&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This means if there is truly that real demand in those 50-100 people who bought and are hodling that 0.01, if all that real demand is being met and satisfied with an artificially large supply, then &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;the TRUE PRICE of Bitcoin should be much much higher!&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; If there is a &amp;amp;#39;run&amp;amp;#39; on Bitcoin (consumers increase purchasing in fear of a shortage) there will not be enough Bitcoin on exchanges to fulfil demand, because most Bitcoin is stored in cold-wallets off of exchanges.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When someone creates an artificial supply of something like WallStreet has done with gold and is now doing with Bitcoin, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;THAT LEADS TO PRICE SUPPRESSION!&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Imagine a run, we all sell our 0.01 btc, the CEXs will not have enough fiat to deliver and would desperately be trying to find collateral - that they couldn&amp;amp;#39;t get - because it does not exist - and the price would skyrocket!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Let me explain again because it&amp;amp;#39;s weird to wrap your head around.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; When we take fiat to the spot market and bid at a suppressed price, at some point there will be no more Bitcoin left to bid on. So we bid higher and higher for this heavily demanded asset! As we bid higher, other HODLers become tempted to sell (wen Lambo? Now!) Bitcoin gets transferred from weak hands to diamond hands and spot price is driven up by the people who want real Bitcoin! If WallStreet wants to drive the price back down to the futures price, they&amp;amp;#39;d have to initiate an arbitrage strategy with Bitcoin in reserve - but &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;THEY HAVE NO BITCOIN LEFT!&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; They will only hold future paper contracts or fiat - causing the price to continuously get bid up higher!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is why it&amp;amp;#39;s so important to transfer your Bitcoin off of exchanges and into a cold storage wallet. The more Bitcoin is off exchanges the larger the short squeeze will be and the less fractional reserve practice bullshit can occur. They will not own the actual Bitcoin like they do the gold, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;WE WILL OWN IT.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Therefore this type of suppression is unsustainable, so buckle up.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Such activity also contributes to fiat inflation, which strengthens both the demand and awareness of Bitcoin itself!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Preventing fake tickets and scams&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Blockchain provides a single source of truth for both ticket holders and organizers. The transfer of NFTs from the initial sale to resale is stored on the blockchain immutably so that all parties can prove the ticket’s authenticity.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;In cases where the resale of tickets is forbidden, NFTs can be developed as non-transferrable, not to be moved to another buyer physically.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Reduce costs&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Costs associated with selling and minting NFTs are negligible as compared to the traditional ticketing system. You can get an unforgeable ticket for less production cost so that customers and organizers can validate the authenticity of every ticket on the chain and track the history of ownership.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Perpetual revenue&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Since programmable NFTs can have built-in rules for merchandise, content, resales, and royalty splits, it means that the organizer can analyze profit sharing percentages for future resales or creative content on secondary markets and receive funds knowing they are unalterable within the NFT’s coding.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;New revenue opportunities&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;NFT-based tickets act as programmable money, providing unlimited potential for new revenue opportunities. For example, the resale of NFT tickets as collectibles, using NFT tickets to provide food and drink deals and rewarding fans who have gathered many event tickets.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Buy Bitcoin:&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When price is below 2 Year Moving Average  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/77o6wlya8mc81.png?width=1326&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=f63540876c57c395eb0154d84f40734dbc3322fe&quot;&amp;gt;2y MA Buytimes&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When Fear and Greed Index is below 20  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Buy times usually line up: Like in January of 2019.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Sell Bitcoin:&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When price is above 2 Year Moving Average x5  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When Puell Year Multiple is above 4.0  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/dg5wa3i69mc81.png?width=1364&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=496466499106e7b491ad9c3ca61513423f835717&quot;&amp;gt;Puell Selltimes&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When Fear and Greed Index is above 75   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/v42djsqh9mc81.png?width=1460&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=abcc34370ebff2cd08252f168976bd2825776518&quot;&amp;gt;F&amp;amp;amp;G Selltimes&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It’s that easy. I mean I&amp;amp;#39;m not going to do it because I’m never selling the greatest most appreciating asset I own, but if you are so included, these are your best bets.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Tldr: It&amp;amp;#39;s great to see they are starting to acknowledge Cardano&amp;amp;#39;s scalability problem, or at least pumping the brakes on their unsubstantiated claims of having solved the trilemma. For the first time, 2021 saw the Cardano community publicly acknowledge some of the limitations of their design that critics have pointed out for years. We&amp;amp;#39;ve come a long way since IOHK was still pretending this was almost ready to go:
&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://nitter.net/iohk_charles/status/1287481374224420864&quot;&amp;gt;https://nitter.net/iohk_charles/status/1287481374224420864&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;1. BLOCK SIZE/ 2. MEMORY/ 3. STORAGE INCREASES&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The bigger the blocks, the higher the memory, and the more storage- the faster the chain. Basically every chain that isn&amp;amp;#39;t already run on super computers can increase blocksizes, memory or storage requirements if they are OK with more centralization and less stability. That&amp;amp;#39;s the trade off. That&amp;amp;#39;s true for Cardano, and it&amp;amp;#39;s true for every other chain. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But how much room does Cardano have to increase parameters? Cardano already has pretty much the same blocksize as Ethereum (72Kb vs ETH&amp;amp;#39;s average of 80Kb) and dramatic increases in blocksize will decrease the number of people who can afford to run nodes, and it also makes the network more likely to fork. The theoretical max limit is 28x the current blocksize, but that is almost certainly not practically possible, and no one supports increasing it to even half of that (which is about the most that has ever been tested), because increasing the blocksize isn&amp;amp;#39;t free. How critical is it for Cardano to maintain as small of blocksizes as possible? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Critical enough that the plan is to only increase in 12.5% intervals when absolutely necessary. The fact that anyone is at all hesitant to increase Cardano&amp;amp;#39;s limit when it&amp;amp;#39;s 72kb tells you that this isn&amp;amp;#39;t a free trade. There is no plan to ever reach max parameters. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://np.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/pf25jk/without_hydra_cardano_probably_wont_be_faster/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;amp;amp;utm_source=share&quot;&amp;gt;https://np.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/pf25jk/without_hydra_cardano_probably_wont_be_faster/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;amp;amp;utm_source=share&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What makes Cardano fundamentally slower than every other chain is how bloated their tx sizes are. We&amp;amp;#39;ve all heard the sales pitch &amp;amp;quot;And Cardano has native tokens that don&amp;amp;#39;t need smart contracts!,&amp;amp;quot; but what you didn&amp;amp;#39;t get told is that native UTXO txs on Cardano are an average of 500 bytes WITHOUT smart contracts. And that a basic, native tx is larger than the average Ethereum tx WITH smart contracts. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And no, the &amp;amp;quot;And Cardano can combine 20 txs into 1 !&amp;amp;quot; meme doesn&amp;amp;#39;t make any difference. The size and speed of each block is all the same regardless of whether you call it 1 tx or 20tx&amp;amp;#39;s. The only thing combining txs does is make Cardano significantly cheaper to DDOS. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://messari.io/asset/ethereum/metrics/network-activity&quot;&amp;gt;https://messari.io/asset/ethereum/metrics/network-activity&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Native Cardano UTXOs are bigger than the average Ethereum tx, and Plutus smart contracts txs are even bigger that - a lot bigger- like 40x the size of Ethereum smart contracts:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Sundaeswap determined that the Cardano network was their primary bottle neck and measured Cardano&amp;amp;#39;s real-world throughput for their smart contracts to be 0.15 TPS.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; That&amp;amp;#39;s 47x slower than a native UTXO on Cardano, 100x slower than an Ethereum tx, and 66,000x slower than a Cosmos and Terra tx. 0.15 TPS is a max of 12,960 txs per day, under ideal conditions... on the entire Cardano chain. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://sundaeswap-finance.medium.com/expectations-congestion-mainnet-launch-e9da5abfd819&quot;&amp;gt;https://sundaeswap-finance.medium.com/expectations-congestion-mainnet-launch-e9da5abfd819&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cardano&amp;amp;#39;s problem is much bigger than anything that can be fixed with a 2x parameter adjustment. Max parameters will never be implemented, and even then, they would still leave Cardano more than 3x slower than the second slowest L1 chain, Ethereum.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;4. Pipe Lining and 5. Input Endorsers&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;...are great ideas. So why are these still in the research phase? They&amp;amp;#39;re promising to deliver a plan that hasn&amp;amp;#39;t even been designed yet. Let&amp;amp;#39;s assume these get designed and developed in 2022. Then Cardano is in the ballpark of Ethereum L1&amp;amp;#39;s low tps and high congestion. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;6. Plutus Script Enhancements&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These are basic functions (that are still in the research phase because of how they conflict with provability in Hydra). Plutus should not even have been released before they developed reference and data inputs. That was an obvious problem, and it was a huge mistake that will create chaos and disappointment.
 &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=3dc6zG9EjWE&amp;amp;amp;t=37m30s&quot;&amp;gt;https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=3dc6zG9EjWE&amp;amp;amp;t=37m30s&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cardano will alway have much larger txs than non-UTXO chains because native UTXOs are so large. On top of that, Plutus&amp;amp;#39; smart contract implementation is extremely bloated and inefficient. The problem is that Cardano&amp;amp;#39;s UTXO model can&amp;amp;#39;t store smart contracts on-chain. So instead of calling an on-chain smart contract, every Cardano SC tx must include the SC script in every tx, because there is no on-chain SC that can simply be referenced again and again. This makes every Cardano smart contract very large. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cardano currently does native asset txs (without smart contracts) at 7 TPS, and that&amp;amp;#39;s the theoretical minimum SC size, if they figure out how to compress SCs 47x. And that means that Cardano SCs will always be at least twice as slow as Ethereum L1&amp;amp;#39;s unbearably slow 15 TPS, for the same blocksize. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now is a good time to point out that it&amp;amp;#39;s clear from their rhetorical focus of comparing their chain to the next slowest chain, that Cardano holders have no idea how slow Ethereum is. Up to this point in time, almost all of Cardano&amp;amp;#39;s txs have been basic UTXO&amp;amp;#39;s that haven&amp;amp;#39;t filled up blocks, because they are a small fraction of the size of smart contracts. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Four months after going live, no one really uses smart contracts on Cardano yet. Muesliswap doesn&amp;amp;#39;t even have $100 Million in TVL (and doesn&amp;amp;#39;t have $5M in liquidity to other tokens). Small NFT drops did bring the network to a crawl, but we haven&amp;amp;#39;t seen speeds across the whole network change dramatically like they will when Sundaeswap launches a real DEX and much bigger txs flood the chain Thursday. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And catching up to Ethereum L1 will not be good enough. Ethereum has L2s already, and nobody would use Eth L1 if it went live for the first time today. Ethereum has the first mover advantage of having all the liquidity. Whales don&amp;amp;#39;t care about a $200 fee, they care about liquidity. They need to move in and out of large positions quickly with as little price impact and slippage as possible.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;7. Node Enhancements&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is not a scaling solution. Yes, fix your bugs and optimize your code. No other chain thinks a node update is a &amp;amp;quot;scaling solution.&amp;amp;quot; This is ridiculous. Let me say this again: Cardano is currently 66,000x slower than Cosmos and Terra.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;8. Side-chains&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Great idea. But Cardano doesn&amp;amp;#39;t have any decentralized side-chains, and they didn&amp;amp;#39;t even get serious about funding any until late last summer. Proper sidechains are the real solution. Milkomeda is on the right track with their M1 sidechain. It&amp;amp;#39;s a accounts model Solidity EVM sidechain that has 32 permissioned nodes and uses slashing. Congratulations on abandoning all of your stated goals, and rushing to produce something usable. We waited six years so Catalyst could fund BSC 2.0.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://dcspark.gitbook.io/milkomeda/our-solution-1/the-m-1-sidechain&quot;&amp;gt;https://dcspark.gitbook.io/milkomeda/our-solution-1/the-m-1-sidechain&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;9. Hydra&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A comprehensive plan for interhead Hydra implementation that approaches anything close to a generalized L2 has yet to be described, let alone developed. We&amp;amp;#39;re still waiting for a basic description of how isomorphic state channels will ever scale dApps or have any use between untrusted parties. Hydra&amp;amp;#39;s 2022 release schedule is for payment channels between trusted parties. Yes, it will be able to handle smart contracts, but not any smart contracts that dApps use. Hydra heads have to be closed every time a party joins or leaves, and they have no known application for dApps. Hydra is really irrelevant, because native UTXO transfers aren&amp;amp;#39;t the problem right now. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://np.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/s18wie/should_cardano_be_prepared_to_abandon_hydra/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;amp;amp;utm_source=share&quot;&amp;gt;https://np.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/s18wie/should_cardano_be_prepared_to_abandon_hydra/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;amp;amp;utm_source=share&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;10. Off-chain computing&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Brilliant. This is a creative solution. Off-chain trusted computations. &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Finally something that makes sense.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; Yes, Cardano users should definitely do their computations somewhere they trust, off-chain... Muhammad Fucking Christ. Let me suggest they do their computations on one of the 79 other L1 blockchains.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;11. Mithril&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To achieve greater scalability, you need to address the complexity of critical operations that depend logarithmically on the number of participants.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What? This is straight gibberish. Mithril is obviously not a relevant scaling solution. Mithril is a solution to a problem that many other chains don&amp;amp;#39;t even have. Even Ethereum can run a trustless lite client. Wtf does that have to do with how slow Cardano SCs are? Your inability to figure out a trustless lite client is irrelevant right now. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;12. Fees&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The short term consequence of Sundaeswap&amp;amp;#39;s launch will be a DDOS attack. Txs across the entire Cardano network will take days to process. I predict that Sundaeswap will be forced to throttle their volume, so that the rest of the chain is usable. Best case scenario for EOY 2022, Cardano users can expect Ethereum L1 tx speeds, if everything goes right.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And Cardano has another problem they still haven&amp;amp;#39;t solved that Ethereum doesn&amp;amp;#39;t have. Slow blockchains require high fees, and Cardano doesn&amp;amp;#39;t have dynamic fees. Price fixing always creates shortages. They need dynamic fees. There&amp;amp;#39;s no way around supply and demand. Everyone has been saying Cardano&amp;amp;#39;s fee model wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t work for years. IOHK is just now taking the question seriously, and their recent moves on fees makes it clear that they have no idea what they are doing. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;People don&amp;amp;#39;t pay fees for fun. The fees are the only thing that make Ethereum usable. You can underpay gas on Ethereum and wait days for the tx to go through if you want, but you can&amp;amp;#39;t manage Defi positions or even use a DEX without cutting in line to get immediate settlement. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It doesn&amp;amp;#39;t matter that txs have a deterministic order. The Cardano chain can&amp;amp;#39;t compute every tx (off-chain) and magically update price feeds with future prices, before the blocks are written. Even on Ethereum txs frequently fall outside of reasonable slippage in minutes. The slippage required to guarantee a tx over 24 hrs would regularly be a double digit percentage of the trade amount. And high slippage is especially a vulnerability for Cardano because so many dApps feature some risk of trusted party ordering. Low slippage is a protection against that.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also, fees are how slow chains keep from getting Ddos attacked (RIP🏴‍☠️ NANO). If less than 13k txs take 24 hours to clear, anyone can completely stop all traffic on the Cardano network for the cost of 13k txs. And they can render it functionally unusable for a fraction of that. The Cardano community has only recently begun to admit that priority fees will be necessary, and their plans for tiered fees are poorly thought out. Search their sub for &amp;amp;quot;fees&amp;amp;quot; and read them blindly trying to reinvent the wheel. This is basic economics, and they have done no real research on it. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For years we were told that the whole point of Cardano was to avoid launching broken products like this. Cardano&amp;amp;#39;s reputation will never recover from this &amp;amp;quot;Move slow and break things&amp;amp;quot; for a food DEX (that originally chose to launch on BSC). &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;ADA was worth more in 2018 than it was worth during its dip last week. What coin do you think ADA holders will have to sell to buy the other half of liquidity pairs to earn rewards on these DEXs? 🤔&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cardano has not been waiting to release better designed, more secure products. Txs that take days was not part of the 4d chess plan. Look at Sundaeswap&amp;amp;#39;s audit and the Plutus exploit. It&amp;amp;#39;s the same stuff we see on other chains, plus slow txs, plus trusted off-chain elements, plus a roadmap that is critically reliant on problems that are unsolved. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;None of these problems are going away in weeks. The problem with Cardano is the complete lack of honesty from leaders and influencers like Charles Hoskinson, who regularly makes false claims, and a culture of over optimism and anti-critical thinking. Their plan isn&amp;amp;#39;t going well, and their jobs rely on them not admitting it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;You&amp;amp;#39;re not gonna make it in crypto unless you know the bullshit &amp;amp;amp; secrets that go on beyond the scenes. In this thread i will tell you what you need to know. You may not like it, but it&amp;amp;#39;s important if you want to level up.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;INTRODUCTION&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Forget everything you think you know about cryptocurrency. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You need to realise crypto is a game. A game where, most likely, you will lose. A game filled with players with more experience than yourself. Players with far more influence, connection and often skill. The inconvenient truth is we aren’t all ‘gonna make it’ &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Beyond Bitcoin &amp;amp;amp; some credible projects there are countless failed ones. Some projects have good intentions but are grossly overvalued. Others are quite simply scams &amp;amp;amp; money grabs.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But before you get angry at me &amp;amp;amp; stop reading. Before you heckle ‘FUD’ or ‘You’re Not Gonna Make It’. Let me explain myself.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yes crypto is filled with scams &amp;amp;amp; scammers, but there is big money to be made. But only IF you understand how the rules of this game work &amp;amp;amp; how to play it successfully. At the moment  many of you are playing the game blindfolded. Giving others the upperhand. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That&amp;amp;#39;s why for this first post I will pull back the curtain. And reveal the rules of the game. The rules many don’t want you to know. If you’ve been in the game for a while you may know some of them. If you’re new, read it twice and let it all sink in.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Why am I doing this? Why am I revealing these secrets? Because before I teach you anything you need to know how this game works. You need to know these rules if you want to have a chance at actually winning. Because if you want to win this game, you must first know how it is played.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So you have two choices in front of you, do you want to learn the truth &amp;amp;amp; get better.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Or do you want to carry on, hopiuming for the best&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;THE FIVE SECRET RULES&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;1 BE WARY OF INFLUENCERS&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyone who has been in crypto for more than six months will likely be aware of the first rule. Many of you will have been wrecked by a big YouTube influencer, who shilled you some random alt coin. You were told it would x100, you aped in &amp;amp;amp; now it&amp;amp;#39;s down 80%. Don’t be embarrassed or ashamed of this. To tell you the truth the same happened to me. In fact it was the best thing that ever happened to me. It taught me to actually do my own research, think for myself &amp;amp;amp; find good people to teach me.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yes there are good people in this crypto game (i’ll share some at the bottom of this article) but you need to understand many are not your friend &amp;amp;amp; they don’t care about your bags. The problem is actually much bigger than you realize too. Many of the biggest YouTube influencers collude together in private telegram groups. They work together to hunt coins with a low market cap &amp;amp;amp; volume, ones that can easily be pumped (and then dumped) in price. They work together to cut deals on new crypto projects and ensure their bags get filled before anyone else. Only to dump on their ‘fans’ down the line. Do you think it’s a confidence that MoonCarl worked with BitBoy, Crypto Banter, MM Crypto &amp;amp;amp; Lark Davies to shill Kasta? I think not.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“But influencer xx is different &amp;amp;#39;&amp;amp;#39; I hear you cry. Well maybe you got lucky &amp;amp;amp; found a good one. Yet even then, you need to be careful. Because if the person has millions of followers on YouTube they may still invertedly pump the price, as their followers ape in. Like it or not, you need to be weary of big YouTube influencers. They aren’t your friend &amp;amp;amp; they don’t care about your god damn bags.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;2 BE CAUTIOUS OF BAD PROJECTS&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some projects will ‘make it’ &amp;amp;amp; usher in a new store value (Bitcoin), Economies (L1s), Defi, gaming (Play2Earn) &amp;amp;amp; digital ownership (NFTs). However most projects won&amp;amp;#39;t. Some projects will have good intentions and create a token to fund an exciting vision. But even then you have to ask the question…if the idea is so good &amp;amp;amp; so financially lucrative, why are they willing to give up so much equity? Would you give up guaranteed money in a lucrative project? I think not. Yes some are committed to a decentralized future but they are few and far between.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Much worse is a bunch of less honorable ‘founders’ and ‘VCs’ that spotted an opportunity for a quick cash grab. These folks, mainly from a sales background, realized pretty quickly that they could get very rich (with very little effort) by doing an ICO and marketing the hell out of it. Their primary business objective isn’t to build a decentralized future, it’s simply to market the hell out of a project and dump their bags on newbies. You need to tell who are the “good” VCs and who are the “bad ones”.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now all of this doesn&amp;amp;#39;t mean you can’t make good money on bad projects, some people made millions off them. But I think you need to be aware of what is going on here, so you can plan your strategy accordingly. Next week I will go into more detail on the strategy I take on finding altcoins and managing risk.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;3 DON&amp;amp;#39;T JOIN A CULT&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Perhaps one of the most dangerous aspects in crypto is the cult. It starts out innocently enough. A friend or someone you respect shills you a crypto project. You decide to read up on it via their website and whitepaper. You begin to follow the project on Twitter and join the Discord &amp;amp;amp; Telegram groups. But this is where the problems start. Because the deeper you go into a project &amp;amp;amp; the more involved you feel, the more dangerous it becomes. You are led to believe you are in a ‘community’ &amp;amp;amp; that you are all ‘gonna make it&amp;amp;#39;, when in fact you are joining a cult.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cult’s are incredibly dangerous in crypto, because they remove your objectivity &amp;amp;amp; critical thinking on a project. You&amp;amp;#39;re surrounded by people in Telegram groups &amp;amp;amp; Discords, who all hold the same biased belief system. And these belief systems &amp;amp;amp; subsequent emotions are amplified ten fold, because money is involved. Think about it, no one is going to doubt their own project when they have so much money invested.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You see cult members everywhere. They are your friends in whatsapp groups, desperately trying to shill you a coin they aped into. They are those random people on Twitter trying to constantly push a project onto you. Everyday I get so many requests to buy project ‘x’ or ‘x to the moon’ but i will never listen. I will always form my own strategy (which will change with time &amp;amp;amp; research) and evaluate accordingly. Some of you may not like my bluntness, but I am not here to tell you what you want to hear or sugar coat it. I want to help you &amp;amp;amp; tell you the truth.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In short, it’s essential you do four things:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Form your own strategy based on research (and always be willing to change it).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Don’t become a cult member, always be objective.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Don’t fall for random shills everyone is talking about.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Don’t listen to people who only believe in one project &amp;amp;amp; refuse to change their hypothesis.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;4 DONT HODL&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;HODL right? That&amp;amp;#39;s what we are told to do. Just HOLD and we are all going to make it. Nope. Outside of Bitcoin and maybe Etherum, you cannot blindly HODL a project. There is no guarantee it is going to make it or that it will be around in the next five years. The altcoin space is incredibly volatile, which is great for exponential gains but can also get you wrecked if you blindly hold onto your bags.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You need to stop falling in love with a project. Oh ‘but the tech is so good’ or ‘the founder is a genius’ I hear you cry. I really don’t care. You need to stop holding your bags for years and take profits when you can. Taking profits is not only essential to de-risk yourself, it is also a great way to release capital to invest in other projects. I recently wrote a thread on taking profits, which seemed to be popular, which you can read below.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;5 STACK BLUE CHIPS&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As I have said earlier, most altcoins won’t make it. Even if they run up x5 or x10 this bull run there is still a chance they could run to zero in the next bear market. Whether you like it or not, your primary objective should be to use the altcoins to increase your gains, take profits and layer into ‘less volatile’ projects like Bitcoin. For all the talk of ‘Bitcoin is a boomer coin’ the fact is, it is the project that has been around the longest and the one which almost certainly won’t fail. And let&amp;amp;#39;s be honest if someone offered you fifty Bitcoin, would you really say no?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Again many of you won’t like this point of view, but again i am not here to sugar coat things. The crypto game is tough and I want to help you by telling you the truth.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;CONCLUSION&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you made it this far, I salute you. Many will have got angry at the truths I laid out. Others may have become disillusioned that the whole game is rigged and there is no hope of winning. But this is not the case at all. As I mentioned at the beginning of this article you first need to know the rules of the game, if you want a chance to win it. This first article is essential because it sets the ground rules of what to avoid &amp;amp;amp; what to do; be weary of big influencers, don’t join a cult, don’t HODL alts &amp;amp;amp; always stack blue chips (Bitcoin).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now we have these rules in place, and truths exposed, we can begin to build our own strategy and figure out how to play this game better.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thank you for reading!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I have been in this space for over two years and learned about scams EARLY on, but just today I saw an advertised live chat between two well known crypto people and clicked it, saw 9k &amp;amp;#39;other people&amp;amp;#39; watching, was like wow, sent it to my friend but then thought, oh right, that channel logo was the wrong color, silly me.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now imagine a novice. People are surprised when they hear about people falling for these but &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;scams are getting more creative and realistic every passing month&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;! No one is immune. I search crypto topics and click websites and my MetaMask pops up like HELLLlloo! and I immediately exit out of the site; but imagine and UNDERSTAND that many people would just sign in without second thought.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;YouTube Live crypto scams netted $8m+ in October 2021 alone. Scammers posing as Michael Saylor have stolen over $1m+ in Bitcoin via YouTube in one go. The value of scamming is increasing and YouTube is doing LITTLE to solve this issue. ChainAlysis says Indians visited crypto scam websites 9.6 million times in 2021. YouTube comments with WhatsApp and Telegram numbers left by scammers to call and obtain your property. Accounts made by bots to host only this junk. YOUTUBE IS DOING LITTLE ABOUT THIS. All articles are just about &amp;amp;quot;raising awareness&amp;amp;quot; but not about waht they are going to do to stop this from continuing.   Try and searching &amp;amp;#39;YouTube&amp;amp;#39; online to research this topic without getting just a list of their videos. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://bitcoinist.com/youtube-crypto-scams-on-the-rise-as-victims-lose-millions/&quot;&amp;gt;There was an article two months ago,&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; but it says NOTHING about YouTubes responsibility in this and I haven&amp;amp;#39;t heard/found much since. There are ways the platform could be ramping up and stopping this type of crap but they take little to no responsibility.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The largest Dogecoin wallet, which currently holds $5 Billion in Doge of its $21 Billion market cap is very mysterious. It was thought to be Robinhood or some other exchange but that has previously been dismissed by the Robinhood CEO himself.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/go0edwi8nic81.png?width=1436&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=67d99e6b36c56bcf24470f6676421f98dee70f4f&quot;&amp;gt;Doge wallet with 23.17&amp;amp;#37; of the entire circulating supply&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Any wallet that holds over 23.17% of the current supply has more than enough to rug pull an entire coin to near zero. Even half of that can cause the price to crash to unrecoverable levels due to how liquidity and market caps work.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;According to Forkast,&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For new cryptocurrencies, if the top 10 wallets hold &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;more than 20% of the&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; token, or worse, a large percentage of the token is held in a single wallet, then this is a dangerous sign of a potential rug pull.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;For Doge, the top 14 wallets own  46.11% of all Dogecoin.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TLDR: Avoid any Cryptocurrency that has wallets capable of rug pulling the entire project. Don&amp;amp;#39;t let a false sense of security take over just because Doge is popular. It still does not make Doge immune to rugpulls. Never let yourself be at the mercy of a single wallet.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;EDIT: The amount of people on the comments claiming it to be the Robinhood wallet DESPITE Robinhood&amp;amp;#39;s CEO publicly stating the company does not hold that much Doge as far back as May is the same argument Shib shillers make. It is careless copium. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketwatch.com/story/a-25-billion-dogecoin-whale-lurks-but-robinhood-ceo-says-we-dont-have-significant-positions-in-any-of-the-coins-we-keep-11620326508&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.marketwatch.com/story/a-25-billion-dogecoin-whale-lurks-but-robinhood-ceo-says-we-dont-have-significant-positions-in-any-of-the-coins-we-keep-11620326508&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Moreover the fact that some people find safety in a company like Robinhood is just stupid. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This means that they will soon compete with the likes of Bitmain in the market for specialized ASICs for Bitcoin mining.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;The full blog post with all the tables is&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-36&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;here&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Welcome! This is the monthly report for my homemade 2019 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund. This group contains &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BTC, XRP, ETH, BCH, EOS, XLM, USDT, LTC, BSV&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Tron.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;tl;dr:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;What&amp;amp;#39;s this all about?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, no selling or trading, reporting monthly for 4 years. Did the same in 2019, 2020, 2021, then again into the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2022/&quot;&amp;gt;2022 Top Ten a few weeks ago&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Learn more about the history, rules, and FAQs of the Experiments (including the answer to the &amp;amp;quot;WHY TETHER?!?!&amp;amp;quot; question)&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;here&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Snapshots taken on the 1st of each month.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;THREE YEAR UPDATE (since Jan. 2019):&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;ETH&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; more than double second place &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BTC&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; (+1,408).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;2019 Top Ten Portfolio up &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;+504%, all coins in the green.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Total market &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;+1,638%&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; over same time period.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;2018+2019+2020+2021 Combined Top Ten Portfolios are returning +406%.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Some exciting new changes for&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2022/&quot;&amp;gt;2022&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;!&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Less spamming the sub with data (down to two reports/month)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Incorporated Decentralized Finance (DeFi) for the first time.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Factoring in stablecoin gains&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;: In the past, I have not included ROI that is possible with stables in the monthly reports. This year, I will detail ways to build on the $100 of USDC in the 2022 portfolio and gamify it a bit: my goal is to outperform as many as the other cryptos in the 2022 Top Ten Portfolio as possible (simple if it turns out to be a bear year, a bit more challenging if the 2022 market moons).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Giveaways: I’ll be giving away crypto during the year, either through Twitter, Reddit, or my email list. I’m still figuring out the details, but aim to give away around $100 a month in crypto.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Friendly competition (or Battle Royale?): I will compare my homemade 2022 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment to a Total Crypto Market Cap Index Token ($TCAP &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://np.reddit.com/r/TotalCryptoMarketCap/&quot;&amp;gt;r/TotalCryptoMarketCap&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;) to see which one outperforms.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On to the report!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Three Year Report – UP 504%  &amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/xu1n8ddlxfc81.png?width=1053&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=7ef47eaab6e80e5674bf779c66fa243d7ab2d6da&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/xu1n8ddlxfc81.png?width=1053&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=7ef47eaab6e80e5674bf779c66fa243d7ab2d6da&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The 2019 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund consists of: &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BTC, XRP, ETH, BCH, EOS, Stellar, USDT, Litecoin, BSV,&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Tron&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;December highlights for the 2019 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A very bloody December&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Ethereum&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; in the overall lead, up +&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;2,608%&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; since January 2019, more than double the ROI of second place &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Bitcoin&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;After three years, the 2019 Portfolio is &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;+504%&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;December Ranking and Dropout Report&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here’s the difference in rank since January 2018:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Top Ten dropouts since January 2019:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; After three years, 60% of the cryptos that &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-one/&quot;&amp;gt;started in the Top Ten in January 2019&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;  have been knocked out.  &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;EOS&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Litecoin, BSV, Stellar, Bitcoin Cash,&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Tron&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; have been replaced by &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Binance Coin, Cardano&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;DOT, SOL&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Luna,&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;USDC.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BSV&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; has fallen the furthest so far (#61) – it is the only crypto that has dropped out of the Top &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Sixty&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;December Winners and Losers&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;December Winners&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; – None, except stablecoin &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Tether&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;December Losers&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; –  &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Litecoin&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; had a tough month, losing nearly one third of its value.  &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;EOS&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; was the second worst performing crypto in the portfolio, down -24% in December.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Tally of Monthly Winners and Losers&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Which crypto holds the most wins or losses over the life of the project?  Here’s a snapshot of the winners and losers over the first three years of the 2019 Top Ten Experiment:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/d41uq71oxfc81.png?width=411&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=a0313ca9aea4e29a41b1997375a5d0ef8d8fc8c2&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/d41uq71oxfc81.png?width=411&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=a0313ca9aea4e29a41b1997375a5d0ef8d8fc8c2&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;By a large margin, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Tether&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; has the greatest number of monthly victories (11) followed by &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;ETH&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; with six.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Every crypto has won at least one month since &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-one/&quot;&amp;gt;January 2019&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BSV&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;USDT&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; have the most losses, 11 each (out of 36 months).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Three Year Update –  ETH easily outperforms its peers, 100% of cryptos in positive territory, EOS worst performing non-stablecoin&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;ETH&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; (+2,608%) is far and away the best performer of this group, more than doubling the ROI of second place &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BTC&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; (+1,144%) over the same period of time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The $100 investment into first place ETH on&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-one/&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;January 1st, 2019&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;is currently worth $2,779.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After three years, 100% of the cryptos in the 2019 Top Ten Portfolio are in positive territory. Not counting stablecoin &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Tether&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, the worst performing crypto is &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;EOS&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, up +18%.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Total Market Cap for the Entire Cryptocurrency Sector:&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/1zr7fl6qxfc81.png?width=582&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=d6893ac17146f4abc52ce9297f9547f63f6c2548&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/1zr7fl6qxfc81.png?width=582&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=d6893ac17146f4abc52ce9297f9547f63f6c2548&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The entire cryptocurrency sector is up +1,638% since &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-one/&quot;&amp;gt;January 2019&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.  This is still well behind first place &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;ETH&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; (2,608%) but much better than the rest of the Top Ten cryptos, including second place &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Bitcoin&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; (+1,144%).  And the total market is performing much better than the Top Ten approach (+504%).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Translation: unless you went all in on &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;ETH&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; or &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Bitcoin&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; three years ago, you were better off diversifying, and much better off if you had captured the gains of the entire crypto market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Top Ten approach has beaten every individual crypto except &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;ETH&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Bitcoin.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto Market Cap Low Point in the 2019 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$114B in&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-one/&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;January 2019&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto Market Cap High Point in the 2019 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$2.65T in&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-34&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;October 2021&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Bitcoin Dominance:&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/p4vy7d1rxfc81.png?width=472&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=ca43c6ecad8a54496045dcedadb0c410a5f9061c&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/p4vy7d1rxfc81.png?width=472&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=ca43c6ecad8a54496045dcedadb0c410a5f9061c&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BitDom&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; dipped in December, ending the month at 40.2%. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;This is a new low for the 2019 Top Ten Experiment.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For context, here are the high and low points of &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BTC&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; domination over the life of the 2019 Experiment:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Low Point in the 2019 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-36&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;40.2% this month&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;High Point in the 2019 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-eight/&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;70.5% in August 2019&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2019:&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/v2sbj97sxfc81.png?width=334&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=bde4010e6f5f58e80820b73502c2fc61cd3efe18&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/v2sbj97sxfc81.png?width=334&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=bde4010e6f5f58e80820b73502c2fc61cd3efe18&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The 2019 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio lost $1,604 in December.  After three years, the value of the initial $1000 investment is &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$6,044&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, up +504%. This is down from &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-35&quot;&amp;gt;last month’s all time high&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; for the 2019 Portfolio. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Below is a table summarizing the monthly ROI over the life of the 2019 Top Ten Index Fund experiments, providing a pretty good sense of the journey up to this point:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/7g2uxemtxfc81.png?width=475&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=5ad095753e9e457d97fcc202836221490ac8dfab&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/7g2uxemtxfc81.png?width=475&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=5ad095753e9e457d97fcc202836221490ac8dfab&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fairly steady upward movements punctuated by massive dips.  During the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-15/&quot;&amp;gt;Zombie Apocalypse&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; in March 2020, for example, the 2019 Top Ten Portfolio was returning only +6%. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Although the 2019 Top Ten Portfolio is up an impressive +504%, it is still a distant second place behind the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-24&quot;&amp;gt;2020 Top Ten Portfolio&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; which is up +795%.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Speaking of other Top Ten Portfolios, let’s put them all together now:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-48&quot;&amp;gt;2018 Top Ten Experiment&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;: up +34% (total value $1,341)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-36&quot;&amp;gt;2019 Top Ten Experiment&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;: up +504% (total value $6,044)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-24&quot;&amp;gt;2020 Top Ten Experiment&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;: up +795% (total value $8,951)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-12&quot;&amp;gt;2021 Top Ten Experiment:&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; up +292% (total value $3,921)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So overall? Taking the four portfolios together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;bottom&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; line: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;After a $4,000 investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; the combined portfolios are worth &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$20,257&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; ($1,341 + $6,044 + $8,951 + $3,921).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;That’s up +406%&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; on the combined portfolios, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;down from&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-35&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;last month’s all time high&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; for the Top Ten Index Fund Experiments.  Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking it in January 2020:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/gjq4nttuxfc81.jpg?width=511&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=65ab5ab731774c7085105e43e0e1385d3196accb&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/gjq4nttuxfc81.jpg?width=511&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=65ab5ab731774c7085105e43e0e1385d3196accb&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In summary: &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;That’s a +406% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for four straight years&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Comparison to S&amp;amp;amp;P 500:&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I’m also tracking the S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 as part of the experiments to have a comparison point with traditional markets. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/51iqwsvvxfc81.png?width=542&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=c29cbcda9723f782bddc351dc10e43b940136129&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/51iqwsvvxfc81.png?width=542&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=c29cbcda9723f782bddc351dc10e43b940136129&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Because the S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 Index is up 90% since January 2019, the initial $1k investment I put into crypto three years ago would be worth $1,900 had it been redirected to the S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 in January 2019. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But what if I took the same world’s-slowest-dollar-cost-averaging $1,000-per-year-on-January-1st-Crypto-Index-Fund-Experiment approach with the S&amp;amp;amp;P 500? It would yield the following:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;$1000 investment in S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1,780 today&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;$1000 investment in S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1,900 today&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;$1000 investment in S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,480 today&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;$1000 investment in S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,270 today&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Taken together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;bottom&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; line for a similar approach with the S&amp;amp;amp;P: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;After four $1,000 investments into an S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, my portfolio would be worth $6,430&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; ($1,780 + $1,900 + $1,480 + $1,270).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That is up &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;+61%&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/&quot;&amp;gt;since January 2018&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; compared to a &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;+406%&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here’s a table providing an overview of the four year ROI comparison between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&amp;amp;amp;P: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/pfynpqtwxfc81.png?width=575&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=d7bf73fba4427a3d03c02fd5391a69efabce1e1b&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/pfynpqtwxfc81.png?width=575&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=d7bf73fba4427a3d03c02fd5391a69efabce1e1b&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Conclusion:&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To both old-timers and newcomers: thanks so much for taking the time to read and for supporting the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments. I hope you find the updates helpful in terms of perspective as you navigate the crypto landscape.  Be careful out there and don’t put your mental, physical, or financial health at risk chasing gainz. If crypto is causing you to lose sleep at night, chances are you have too much in crypto: try to think long term and don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I found the scammers wallet address and found that the scammer has received a whooping total of 87 BTC(Worth a total of 3.6 mil).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This person managed to earn 3.6mil dollars from a YouTube live video. This money is enough for someone to retire and live a happy life and falling for such a petty scam is stupidity at its finest. Now there is one very happy Nigerian prince out there. Doing almost nothing for a cool 3.6 million dollars.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I have decided to do research on tools that can be used to not fall for these scams. I will make a post on what these scams look like, what you can do to make other people aware and not fall for these yourself. It may not be perfect but I will try. I can use all the help I can get.

Then it goes to 40K and they say: Oh it&amp;amp;#39;s going to 30K. When it goes to 30K, I&amp;amp;#39;ll go all in!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then it reaches 30K and they hope for 10K.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The opposite also happens, with people saying: When Bitcoin reaches 50K, I&amp;amp;#39;ll take profits. Then it reaches 50K and you wait for 60K to take profits. Then 70K.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The thing is, Bitcoin has been at or below 10K &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;for a decade&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, why didn&amp;amp;#39;t you go all in then? Maybe 40K is the lowest we ever go, who knows. But if you wanted to buy at 40K when we were at 60K, then buy at 40K.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Many people say: When we get a bear market, then I&amp;amp;#39;ll buy! But it&amp;amp;#39;s kinda like: When it&amp;amp;#39;s 2023, then I&amp;amp;#39;ll start losing weight!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I know there are exceptions and I know some people are very disciplined in their crypto goals. I know 100 people are going to reply to this: &amp;amp;quot;Just DCA and HODL&amp;amp;quot;. Yes, that&amp;amp;#39;s fine, as long as you continue doing that during the bear market, and don&amp;amp;#39;t capitulate then.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;So if you were hoping for 40K when we were at 60K, don&amp;amp;#39;t hope for 20K now, then you&amp;amp;#39;ll never buy.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I say this from the perspective of the average user.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How to explain to a newcomer who wants to buy, say, an ERC-20 token that he has to pay hundreds of dollars to perform ordinary transactions. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And then the newcomer needs to be explained that a fee that can cost him hundreds of dollars can be lost forever if the transaction fails. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cryptocurrencies should make our finances easier, not harder. And I&amp;amp;#39;m sorry to say this, but I think that with ETH 2.0, the fees will also be incredibly expensive. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the real world, people aren’t used to paying that much for everyday transactions. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How do you even start researching and trading ETH if you are from some country where salary is less than the fee that we need to pay?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The vision of the crypto future should be cheap, nobody wants to pay a few hundred to enjoy that freedom.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;ve created a resource that details interest rates paid on almost 200 different coins by some of the leading exchanges, lenders, and wallets. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you&amp;amp;#39;re familiar with earning a yield on your coins, jump to the end of this post for the link.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you&amp;amp;#39;re not familiar with earning a yield on your coins, I&amp;amp;#39;m about to turn your world upside down! If you didn&amp;amp;#39;t already know, there are a number of companies out there who will pay in-kind interest on your coins for doing nothing other than holding them on their platform. In-kind interest is one of the easiest ways to compound your investment and see exponential returns! So not only will you be earning interest on your coins while you wait for the price to moon, the interest you earn along the way will moon right along with it!!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Don&amp;amp;#39;t take my word for it. Give it a go. Lower you average purchase price. Fatten your bags while you sleep. Stack your coins regardless of bear or bull or crab or shark or tadpole or beaver or flightless bird cycle. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyway, here is my &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vpBQI2DFUk7zXS4TCs9ZOnatvWHiYf5jHjKgKpfJG5Y/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&amp;gt;Interest Rates Comparison Tool&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; for you to use, free of charge. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you have any questions about earning interest on your coins, questions about any of the platforms featured in this tool, questions about this tool, or really just crypto questions in general, I&amp;amp;#39;m more than happy to talk through them with you! I&amp;amp;#39;m happy to continue this thread or communicate via dm, whichever you&amp;amp;#39;re more comfortable with.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Those who followed their original strategy and didn&amp;amp;#39;t panic, were the ones who eventually got the most out of the market. People that panic not only leave the market with  losses, they kill off future potential gains too.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Meanwhile, people that accumulate during dips are usually the ones to reap the maximum benefits when the market eventually recovers. I&amp;amp;#39;ve seen this first hand after the May crash. Most people lost faith and left the market in a loss thinking this was the end of the cycle, while those who accumulated reaped all the benefits after the market pumped late July.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you area newbie  investing into Crypto, never give up. The market will never go up in a straight like and there will always be significant dips along the way. The best thing to do in a bearish market right now is to accumulate for the next pump, because when it does, people like you who stuck around during the bad times will be the ones with the most gains.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And in case you didn&amp;amp;#39;t notice:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&quot;md-spoiler-text&quot;&amp;gt;It is 2022.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&quot;md-spoiler-text&quot;&amp;gt;Bitcoin did in fact NOT hit even close to $100k.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That doesn&amp;amp;#39;t mean that the market won&amp;amp;#39;t go down of course, it very likely could go down further. It also could start pumping and if you don&amp;amp;#39;t continue to DCA you&amp;amp;#39;ll miss the chance to average down those ATH buy in prices you probably entered the market with. The market is already almost 50% down, even if it dips further this is still a great price point to be buying in on almost all coins in terms of risk / reward.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The point is that take two massive piles of table salt whenever anyone tries to tell you they are anything other than &amp;amp;#39;guessing&amp;amp;#39; what the market is going to do. Ignore all the &amp;amp;#39;TA&amp;amp;#39; and the graphs and the political rumours and hearsay and don&amp;amp;#39;t worry about the stock markets. They have been telling me that the stock markets are about to crash any day now for over a year and the FTSE just keeps on reaching new post-COVID highs.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So invest wisely and DO research and make informed opinions but also filter out the doomsayers and the market crash predicters.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here is my pro tip for all of you. I made lots of trades, lots. Not only did I do that, I used mutiple exchanges and even more wallets. So my transaction count is quite high. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here is the real bear though. When you sit here and import everything into your coin tracker of choice (Koinly here), everything may not be there. I spent the last two days trying different platforms and importing API’s. Nothing seemed to work. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thankfully, I keep records of everything and was able link everything up manually over about six hours. Needless to say, dont be me. Being more of a minimalist when it comes to exchanges and wallets is by far the way to go. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Lastly, Fuck Uncle Sam and capital gains…&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
