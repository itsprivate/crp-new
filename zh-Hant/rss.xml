&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Although, precious metals slowly started losing a lot of their uses in the mainstream market. And in the event that crypto goes mainstream and most people start using it, I expect the same to happen to fiat.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Its dumb to assume that fiat will completely fade away into obscurity, but it will for sure be losing a lot of dominance in favor of crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And this reality might not be too far away from happening. We’re already seeing things like crypto credit cards from platforms like Binance, Coinbase and CoinOvy gaining a lot of popularity in the mainstream market. These crypto-to-fiat bridges will give crypto a lot of exposure and help make the transition to full in crypto payments much easier and smoother.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Every time I read it, I end up crying. Hal was paralyzed by this time and he was typing this message using an eye-tracking device.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“I thought I&amp;amp;#39;d write about the last four years, an eventful time for Bitcoin and me.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For those who don&amp;amp;#39;t know me, I&amp;amp;#39;m Hal Finney. I got my start in crypto working on an early version of PGP, working closely with Phil Zimmermann. When Phil decided to start PGP Corporation, I was one of the first hires. I would work on PGP until my retirement. At the same time, I got involved with the Cypherpunks. I ran the first cryptographically based anonymous remailer, among other activities.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fast forward to late 2008 and the announcement of Bitcoin. I&amp;amp;#39;ve noticed that cryptographic graybeards (I was in my mid 50&amp;amp;#39;s) tend to get cynical. I was more idealistic; I have always loved crypto, the mystery and the paradox of it.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When Satoshi announced Bitcoin on the cryptography mailing list, he got a skeptical reception at best. Cryptographers have seen too many grand schemes by clueless noobs. They tend to have a knee jerk reaction.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I was more positive. I had long been interested in cryptographic payment schemes. Plus I was lucky enough to meet and extensively correspond with both Wei Dai and Nick Szabo, generally acknowledged to have created ideas that would be realized with Bitcoin. I had made an attempt to create my own proof of work based currency, called RPOW. So I found Bitcoin facinating.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When Satoshi announced the first release of the software, I grabbed it right away. I think I was the first person besides Satoshi to run bitcoin. I mined block 70-something, and I was the recipient of the first bitcoin transaction, when Satoshi sent ten coins to me as a test. I carried on an email conversation with Satoshi over the next few days, mostly me reporting bugs and him fixing them.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Today, Satoshi&amp;amp;#39;s true identity has become a mystery. But at the time, I thought I was dealing with a young man of Japanese ancestry who was very smart and sincere. I&amp;amp;#39;ve had the good fortune to know many brilliant people over the course of my life, so I recognize the signs.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After a few days, bitcoin was running pretty stably, so I left it running. Those were the days when difficulty was 1, and you could find blocks with a CPU, not even a GPU. I mined several blocks over the next days. But I turned it off because it made my computer run hot, and the fan noise bothered me. In retrospect, I wish I had kept it up longer, but on the other hand I was extraordinarily lucky to be there at the beginning. It&amp;amp;#39;s one of those glass half full half empty things.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The next I heard of Bitcoin was late 2010, when I was surprised to find that it was not only still going, bitcoins actually had monetary value. I dusted off my old wallet, and was relieved to discover that my bitcoins were still there. As the price climbed up to real money, I transferred the coins into an offline wallet, where hopefully they&amp;amp;#39;ll be worth something to my heirs.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Speaking of heirs, I got a surprise in 2009, when I was suddenly diagnosed with a fatal disease. I was in the best shape of my life at the start of that year, I&amp;amp;#39;d lost a lot of weight and taken up distance running. I&amp;amp;#39;d run several half marathons, and I was starting to train for a full marathon. I worked my way up to 20+ mile runs, and I thought I was all set. That&amp;amp;#39;s when everything went wrong.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My body began to fail. I slurred my speech, lost strength in my hands, and my legs were slow to recover. In August, 2009, I was given the diagnosis of ALS, also called Lou Gehrig&amp;amp;#39;s disease, after the famous baseball player who got it.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;ALS is a disease that kills moter neurons, which carry signals from the brain to the muscles. It causes first weakness, then gradually increasing paralysis. It is usually fatal in 2 to 5 years. My symptoms were mild at first and I continued to work, but fatigue and voice problems forced me to retire in early 2011. Since then the disease has continued its inexorable progression.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Today, I am essentially paralyzed. I am fed through a tube, and my breathing is assisted through another tube. I operate the computer using a commercial eyetracker system. It also has a speech synthesizer, so this is my voice now. I spend all day in my power wheelchair. I worked up an interface using an arduino so that I can adjust my wheelchair&amp;amp;#39;s position using my eyes.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It has been an adjustment, but my life is not too bad. I can still read, listen to music, and watch TV and movies. I recently discovered that I can even write code. It&amp;amp;#39;s very slow, probably 50 times slower than I was before. But I still love programming and it gives me goals. Currently I&amp;amp;#39;m working on something Mike Hearn suggested, using the security features of modern processors, designed to support &amp;amp;quot;Trusted Computing&amp;amp;quot;, to harden Bitcoin wallets. It&amp;amp;#39;s almost ready to release. I just have to do the documentation.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And of course the price gyrations of bitcoins are entertaining to me. I have skin in the game. But I came by my bitcoins through luck, with little credit to me. I lived through the crash of 2011. So I&amp;amp;#39;ve seen it before. Easy come, easy go.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That&amp;amp;#39;s my story. I&amp;amp;#39;m pretty lucky overall. Even with the ALS, my life is very satisfying. But my life expectancy is limited. Those discussions about inheriting your bitcoins are of more than academic interest. My bitcoins are stored in our safe deposit box, and my son and daughter are tech savvy. I think they&amp;amp;#39;re safe enough. I&amp;amp;#39;m comfortable with my legacy.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Ape coin is trending all over the place, so now would be a good time to look at the past performance of popular memecoins and see why it&amp;amp;#39;s a bad idea to ape into Apecoin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Technical Analysis&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;But that dogecoin guy became a millionaire by investing his life savings in cute doggo token&amp;amp;quot;. Well here&amp;amp;#39;s a chart for Dogecoin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/1mrvbri4ldo81.png?width=1020&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=0e3b93bea732d7693b0f879eb7a82ad0d74d4618&quot;&amp;gt;DOGE/BTC Chart | Binance | Heikin Ashi&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;No surprises here. Dogecoin has been bleeding against Bitcoin for almost a year now. That means, investors who bought doge, took an &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;incredibly&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; higher risk(than btc investors) and got &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;worse&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; returns. I can&amp;amp;#39;t think of any financial asset with worse risk-adjusted-returns. In short, if you&amp;amp;#39;re investing in altcoins, you would want your alt to perform as well as BTC or better since they are inherently riskier.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here&amp;amp;#39;s a similar story for Shiba Inu:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As seen in the previous chart, we can see an initial few days of hype, and then a continuous bleed against BTC.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Fundamental Analysis&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Timing&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now is probably the worst time to invest in highly speculative assets. The terrible Russia-Ukraine war is happening, and the global economy and supply chains are heavily affected due to that.  Taking an excessive amount of financial risk at this moment is the last thing you&amp;amp;#39;d want to do.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Lastly, if you&amp;amp;#39;re playing the short term game, you have already lost. Like all financial markets, crypto will transfer wealth from the impatient to the patient investor.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TLDR: Don&amp;amp;#39;t buy ApeCoin or any meme-coins. You&amp;amp;#39;re likely going to regret it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Apparently the new &amp;amp;#39;Spending Power&amp;amp;#39; feature let&amp;amp;#39;s you take a crypto loan using your staked coins as collateral... with 0% interest if that loan is repaid within 7 days. This seems like a fairly original idea as you continue to earn interest on any coins in Earn while being allowed to use those same coins as collateral for the &amp;amp;#39;Spending Power&amp;amp;#39; loan. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;From what I&amp;amp;#39;ve read, this new feature is already rolling out in Canada and the borrow limit is tied to card tier.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;More importantly, this is a super convenient way to top up your CDC card immediately while waiting for fiat to be credited from your bank account to the CDC Fiat Wallet (and free due to that 7-day 0% interest period). &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Loans which are not repaid within 7 days then accrue interest at 9.99%.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As someone who was massively critical when CDC decreased the Earn Limit recently, that does now start to make a little more sense. More importantly, this will hopefully inspire other lenders (Nexo, etc) to start offering similar interest free loans.... &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m a guy and I&amp;amp;#39;ve been speaking with a girl from another country for about 3 months now. I would say its more than a friendship. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyway, very early on in our conversations she brought up crypto mining and said that I should do it, and she would show me how.
I did some research and thought there&amp;amp;#39;s no way I can crypto mine, 1: I&amp;amp;#39;m not clever enough and 2: I haven&amp;amp;#39;t even got a computer,  let alone super computer power. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;She then got me to download a digital wallet app and another app where I will transfer my crypto too. We are &amp;amp;#39;mining&amp;amp;#39; USTD, which is a stable coin. 
However,  I&amp;amp;#39;m sure it&amp;amp;#39;s not crypto mining, she&amp;amp;#39;s basically give me a hyperlink to use on the DApps (Decentralized apps) which takes me through to a mining pool where I can claim anywhere from 1-6% interest daily (depending on my wallet balance) &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So I started off putting 100 USDT to see if it would work,  and it sure did. I was receiving 1.5% everyday, but that&amp;amp;#39;s hardly nothing. After 3 weeks I put 1000 USDT in and was reaping a 3% interest everyday. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fast forward a couple months,  obviously I have been speaking to this girl everyday and the trust levels are building. Last week, I deposited another 8300 USDT to boost it to 10,000. That way i get 3.5% of that everyday. She tells me she has over 100,000 deposited which means she gets 4.5% daily,  she makes 4500 USDT in one day... &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;ve made 2,300 USTD in the last 6 days, since I increased my balance to 10,000. But it all seems way too good to be true?? Surely no one can make this much money a day, for literally doing nothing. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This girl I&amp;amp;#39;m speaking to now wants me to deposit even more to take advantage of even higher interest rates,  and it&amp;amp;#39;s making me suspicious. Could she literally take my money through the 3rd party DApp? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;ve already deposited money to my bank twice before and have been successful, so withdrawing the cash isn&amp;amp;#39;t an issue. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I done some research on &amp;amp;#39;Coin Staking&amp;amp;#39; and this sounds a lot similar to what I&amp;amp;#39;m actually doing.  With coin staking, your essentially donating your crypto assets to contribute to the blockchain, and you get rewarded each time a transaction gets validated. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m really hoping someone can help shed some light on what I&amp;amp;#39;m actually involved in. I&amp;amp;#39;m happy to answer any questions. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thanks so much!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I only have relevant holdings of four coins: BTC, ETH, another top coin that this sub likes a lot and one pretty small coin that also used to be popular around here, as my high-risk option. I don&amp;amp;#39;t mention the other two explicitly because this is not a shill post, the message is: I have a portfolio this sub would pretty much approve of, I don&amp;amp;#39;t have any meme coins or hyped moonshots, not even in my smaller, insignificant holdings.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That&amp;amp;#39;s because I don&amp;amp;#39;t really like meme coins. Don&amp;amp;#39;t really see the appeal, except from trying to get lucky and make money quick. But I dislike misinformation even more, and I see problems about that on this sub. If someone made a post right now where they said&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;ICP founder confirms: &amp;amp;quot;It was a planned rug pull from the beginning!&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;and completely made up a story, it would get hundreds, maybe thousands of upvotes. Maybe the mods would remove it at some point, maybe not. But people would eat it up. If I then came along and made another post that elaborately showed how that post just completely lied, it would get buried in downvotes and only a few people would read it. I could start with a disclaimer that I don&amp;amp;#39;t think ICP is a good project and that I don&amp;amp;#39;t hold any and never did, people would still call me an ICP shill that is bitter because he gambled on the wrong coin and is now trying to pump his bags.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How do I know that? &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Because it happened to me multiple times.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; I really dislike misinformation and the unfounded circle-jerk-hating that&amp;amp;#39;s going on here. So quite a few of the posts I make are just trying to correct false information that got really popular on here, I feel like half my posts start with &amp;amp;quot;No, &amp;amp;quot;. If this misinformation I am trying to correct is about the coins this sub hates, however, this usually doesn&amp;amp;#39;t go so well. Two examples:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A few months ago, I made a post saying that it was a bad argument to say Doge is dead just because it&amp;amp;#39;s down from ATH (back then, there were multiple very popular post saying just that), when almost everything was down from ATH. I did not say a positive word about Doge, just that &amp;amp;quot;being down from ATH&amp;amp;quot; is a bad argument, especially for a coin that has been surviving for 8 years. I was called a shill, people told me I fell for a get rich quick scheme (&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;remember, I never had any Doge and also said that in the post&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;) etc.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Similarly, today I made a post that &amp;amp;quot;ApeCoin fell 80% on its first day&amp;amp;quot; is just as misleading as &amp;amp;quot;ApeCoin increased 2,700% on its first day&amp;amp;quot; and pretty much just lying. In the post I said that I was not interested at all in the coin, that it might be a scam but is most likely just a pretty bad coin. But well, that specific popular &amp;amp;quot;criticism&amp;amp;quot; on here was not valid as everyone that didn&amp;amp;#39;t buy in the first two minutes after launch (i.e. some bots) currently made a profit. You guessed it: I&amp;amp;#39;m a shill, I&amp;amp;#39;m defending a scam, I fell for a scam (&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;remember: I did not&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It happened more often than this, usually in comments. And I am more annoyed about it than I should be. This mindset is just weird: &amp;amp;#39;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;I don&amp;amp;#39;t like this coin, so I will just upvote negative posts about it and don&amp;amp;#39;t care if they say the truth or not. If someone corrects these lies, they are shills&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#39;. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Why this friend-or-enemy mentality? Why can people in crypto not accept that maybe, while their favorite coins are &amp;amp;#39;good&amp;amp;#39; on average, they have flaws and pointing them out is not FUD or makes someone a hater? And that the coins they hate might be &amp;amp;#39;bad&amp;amp;#39; on average, but not everything about them is, and that correcting misinformation about them is not shilling?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;amp;quot;I think coin X is bad, but this one aspect about it is just not true&amp;amp;quot; would be an awful shill. Who would buy a coin because of that?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;tl;dr: shades of grey exist, not everything is black and white. If someone doesn&amp;amp;#39;t join in some circle-jerk-hating, that doesn&amp;amp;#39;t make them a shill. If someone thinks not everything about a coin is perfect, that doesn&amp;amp;#39;t make them a hater.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

According to the bill, exchanges, intermediaries etc should stop dealing with addresses originating from Russians. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;She is seeking to cut off every Russian from crypto even though they have nothing to do with Putin&amp;amp;#39;s war. What is worse is that even decentralised protocol devs could be held liable if somehow a Russian ends up using their protocol or tool. How does this make any sense? Protocol developers have no way of limiting who uses their software. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;FBI, White House, Treasury department have all said that crypto is not being used to evade sanctions in any serious sums worth paying attention to. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coincenter.org/new-crypto-sanctions-bill-targets-publishing-code-facilitating-transactions/&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.coincenter.org/new-crypto-sanctions-bill-targets-publishing-code-facilitating-transactions/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bill would place sweeping restrictions on persons who build, operate, and use cryptocurrency networks even if they have no knowledge or intent to help evade sanctions though the Administration’s own experts have repeatedly said cryptocurrency evasion is not serious&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Senator Warren and a raft of Democratic co-sponsors today introduced a bill titled the Digital Asset Sanctions Compliance Enhancement Act, which would place sweeping restrictions on the cryptocurrency ecosystem under the guise of bolstering sanctions against Russia for its unjustified invasion of Ukraine. She has done this despite the fact that there is no data suggesting that cryptocurrency has been used–or can meaningfully be used–by sanctioned parties to evade sanctions, and despite the fact that frontline officials from the White House, Treasury, and the Department of Justice have all stated that cryptocurrency is a poor tool for sanctions evasion and one that they have well under control.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For example, FBI Director Christopher Wray said last Thursday at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Russians’ ability to circumvent the sanctions with cryptocurrency is probably highly overestimated on the part of maybe them and others. We are, as a community and with our partners overseas, far more effective on that than I think sometimes they appreciate.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;White House has also said &amp;amp;quot;cryptocurrency is an ineffective primary tool for the state&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is well reported that the Russian state is planning or already using Chinese Yuan, Indian government&amp;amp;#39;s aide to evade sanctions, not crypto. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Why is she so unhinged against crypto? Someone must be funding her so much that she spends her entire time talking shit about crypto and brining about senseless regulations. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;She does not even understand crypto, yet comes up with senseless regulations that cannot be complied in good faith.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
