&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One bear market was all that it took to send crypto users into total disarray. There are panic sellers, those that fearmonger --HOLY SHIT IT IS GOING TO $0. EVERYONE SHOULD PANIC SELL-- and there are those that keep calm and know that it is inevitable for BTC to bounce back where it was in November. But does that happen? Hell no. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Maybe some of you. But looking at social media, mostly Twitter, during the crash, most of the people are not cut out to invest, it seems regardless of how much they actually invest. But ultimately, I think it is a good thing since what it does is weed out the competiton so that there&amp;amp;#39;s more profit for those that are &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;not&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; fragile.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yes you read that right, 10+ btc in a few hours. The transactions are pouring in. These are not fake transactions but actual victims.  People are really that dumb. The video shows up everywhere  on YouTube for anything crypto related. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This has been going on for 3 years now. By my estimation, $100+ million has been stolen so far over thousands of videos and addresses. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That is organized crime on a big scale all on youtube&amp;amp;#39;s platform as they do nothing. This is more than even drug gangs make. More even fictionalized crime.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Point is, don’t take anyone’s advice because in crypto world no one has any idea what will happen next. Keep your money safe and don’t make decisions that’ll make you miserable. I have invested at wrong times many times now and I know the feeling. It’s awful. So assess your personal situation and expect for things to get worse.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;call me evil, an a hole, machiavellian or whatever. but I am enjoying this moment of big old humble pie. crypto has been trending towards a meme, just another fad in pop culture. something you become a part of cos its cool, not because of the tech, disruption or any logical reason.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;we are going to see a lot of noobs and dweebs get cleared out from this space. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;we are also going to see a lot of scam coins, shitcoins, and downright terrible project disappear for the better.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;this is the massive clean up we have needed for some time. the markets, and I mean ALL markets have been frothing for some time now.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;if you truly understand and believe in crypto you will stay, and I will see you in 6 months time on the other side.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;to all the obnoxious morons who thought they were so clever getting into crypto for the culture, GOODBYE!!! and good riddance.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We are yet to see Feds increasing the interest rates which they have to increase to curb the inflation&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Prediction is that this decision will come by march so during Feb to March the chances that crypto prices will increase during this time is negligible. Now imagine cryto prices declining(Or being stable) till march and then feds will decide to increase the interest rate. Imagine the amount of panic selling that would be there.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also when interest rates will be increased there would be less money in circulation so naturally less people will invest in crypto so it will go even more down&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I am scared to say this that it may reach 20k$ or even less. Then only it can go up&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

It was always about making sound money with predictable and fair rules. You don’t make money with Bitcoin, because it is “money”.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Just like gold, first people have to believe it’s a store of value, then a layer on top of it will be for transactions. There are basically two outcomes for that vision:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It succeeds and Bitcoin becomes the global money system &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It fails and goes to zero after successive governments bans and mainstream fud&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You measure which one is more likely by things like the network value, hash rate, adoption, etc.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Whether it is $44k or $38k or $75k is completely irrelevant. Just like whether Bitcoin was $100 or $400 few years ago is irrelevant today.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you don’t believe in #1 and want some exposure just in case, just put 1% of your net worth in there and forget it. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you fully believe in #1, DCA and Hodl. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you want to trade in and out, Bitcoin is terrible for that. At a minimum, you will be paying trading fees and terrible spread. Just open a brokerage account and trade some stock that you feel good about.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you need the money or are getting overly emotional then by all means cash out. Sometimes its better to have an unknown loss than live in anxiety. Next time just think carefully about your boundaries and where investing becomes gambling.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I think its important to use the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;3 Year Rule&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; in crypto. (to my knowledge) On every date Bitcoin has always been worth more than it was three years prior. Thus, if you cannot live without your funds for the next three years you are investing too much.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Disclaimer: &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Ya ne Russki, nu ya mogu govorite i chitat Russki yazik&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; (I&amp;amp;#39;m not Russian, but I can speak and read the Russian language). &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As usual the mass media have painted a dystopian picture of how the authoritarian Russian Federation have decided to ban crypto currencies full stop. Blah, blah.... it&amp;amp;#39;s China all over again, blah, blah.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Except that isn&amp;amp;#39;t what the report is proposing - and yes, it&amp;amp;#39;s only a proposal at this stage - an awfully long way from ever becoming law for multiple reasons. In Russia, government is not actually dictated by the Kremlin, contrary to popular Western perception. Here is what is actually being proposed:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A ban on the mining of cryptocurrencies on the territory of the Russian Federation. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A ban on Russian banks permitting their customers to buy, sell or trade cryptocurrencies.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A ban on crypto currency exchanges operating on the territory of the Russian Federation. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Most interestingly of all, the new proposals did not come from the Russian Central Bank (which did ban the use of cryptocurrency as a means of payment in 2020). These new proposals actually came from the FSB (The Federal Security Service), which has proposed:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#39;A complete ban of all cryptocurrency transactions in Russia, in order to undermine the financing of “foreign agent” media outlets, “undesirable” organizations, and the opposition.&amp;amp;#39;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Given the security situation in Western Russia (border with Ukraine), it&amp;amp;#39;s no great surprise that the FSB are currently influencing Russian government policy more so than typically. Yet it remains HIGHLY unlikely that these proposals will ever pass into law. Moreover we&amp;amp;#39;ve been here before:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-cenbank-bitcoin/russia-turns-cold-on-crypto-currencies-idUSKBN1CF0RF&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-cenbank-bitcoin/russia-turns-cold-on-crypto-currencies-idUSKBN1CF0RF&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Many commentators agree:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;John Wu, president of Ava Labs:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“Once again we’re seeing the crypto markets’ resilience to this kind of posturing. This is just the latest installment in a pattern of monetary authorities calling for a ban of crypto, and either seeing no further action or reversing their stance in the near future.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Indeed, the Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov recently stated that: “There is no sense in banning them, there is a need to regulate them&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then just yesterday, Elizaveta Danilova, the head of the Russian Central Bank&amp;amp;#39;s Financial Stability Department, publicly stated that &amp;amp;quot;Restrictions on owning cryptocurrencies are not envisaged&amp;amp;quot;. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So what we are seeing is typical of how government operates in Russia: the usual power struggle between the security services and central government. Right now the FSB does have the upper hand, but that will only remain so as long as the threat of war with Ukraine is present.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Today it hurts, I won&amp;amp;#39;t lie. Months and months of unrealized profits, poof, gone. We can spend all day moping around, but it won&amp;amp;#39;t get us anywhere. Nothing has changed our investment thesis: crypto will improve our world, so in the long run, we&amp;amp;#39;ll be rewarded.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I feel like chasing the gloomy sub mood, so here are five reasons to stay bullish for the long term.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;1-Several hundreds millions of people hold &amp;amp;amp; use crypto worldwide&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s hard to get an accurate estimate, but the best source I could find states that there is &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://triple-a.io/crypto-ownership/&quot;&amp;gt;at least 300 million people holding crypto in the world&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. We definitely got mainstream last year, and the sheer amount of users makes it unlikely everything will go to zero anytime soon.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;2-Energy consumption of crypto will go down a lot, very soon&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This week, US Congress is holding hearings about the energy consumption of cryptocurrencies. People are concerned about this, but here&amp;amp;#39;s the thing : the second biggest coin out there by market cap, ETH, will switch off proof-of-work forever &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://ethblogging.wordpress.com/2021/12/24/eth-merge-eth-2-0-upgrade-will-be-renamed-to-bellatrix-hard-fork-eth-to-the-stars-and-beyond/&quot;&amp;gt;in six months&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. This will cut down it&amp;amp;#39;s energy consumption by about 99% - and the same goes for every ERC-20 tokens and every ERC-721 NFTs out there.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;3-Usecases are becoming more and more apparent&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Unbanked people in Argentina are using the Binance Smart Chain to accept payments. Major credit cards companies such as Visa and MasterCard are launching crypto products. Web3 social media is rising fast - same for P2E blockchain-based games. ENS domains are becoming a thing. The list goes on and on.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;2-Institutions are getting onboard&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While it may take a while, pension funds, hedge funds and state-sponsored sovereign funds are getting interested in crypto. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/lawrencewintermeyer/2021/08/12/institutional-money-is-pouring-into-the-crypto-market-and-its-only-going-to-grow/?sh=4b3f69114598&quot;&amp;gt;About 7 out of 10 institutional investors&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; recently surveyed by Forbes planned to buy and hold crypto. Medium-term, this will make our assets less volatile, with blue-chips such as ETH and BTC beeing seen as &amp;amp;quot;internet bonds&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;1-The most brillant minds are getting into crypto&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The crypto job market is in a frenzy. Developers are leaving web giants to go work for CEXs, L2 solutions, fintechs, etc. An Ethereum developer can get $300k/year nowadays. Cryptography research is going very well, and concepts such as zero-knowledge proof are already being used in protocols.

We might be watching on of the richest countries of the world on the upcoming years under construction, and maybe one of the smartest financial moves that a country has ever made. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Price is changing but Bitcoin fundamentals are strong, and hasn&amp;amp;#39;t changed, keep stacking those sats if you can. I have a strong conviction on Bitcoin for the future, this is only getting started.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That&amp;amp;#39;s when I made the worst mistake of my life, I Listened to people on &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/CryptoCurrency&quot;&amp;gt;r/CryptoCurrency&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I put the phone down and looked around only to see the very thing I&amp;amp;#39;ve been hiding from my entire life, bills, debt, crippling depression, no social skills, the inability to relate to others and worst of all being poor.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Being poor sucks.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;I checked the mail and apparently I owe a lot of money to different companies for things like electricity and water.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;I looked at my real wallet and its even emptier than my crypto wallet.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;I screamed ALGO!!! at the store and people didn&amp;amp;#39;t applaud me or start saying &amp;amp;quot;if you go, I&amp;amp;#39;ll ALGO&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;I told the cashier that FIAT is poison and she should accept bitcoin but she just stared at me and told me not to worry about paying but that I wasn&amp;amp;#39;t allowed to return.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;after a difficult day I pulled out my Ace and said Moon&amp;amp;#39;s to $1.00 but was only met with stares.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;so the moral of the story is don&amp;amp;#39;t listen to people on this sub, the real world sucks and they don&amp;amp;#39;t even have gifs.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TLDR: its not all sunshine and rainbows out in the world, so keep looking at the charts and shitposting.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With bitcoin going down to 30k we wont see any all time high soon, so we wont miss lifechanging money or crazy altcoin pumps, cause they wont happen.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So just make some coin alerts, for example i set btc for 30k and 50k and also for the other two coins i own, ETH and TRAC, and try to enjoy life, forget about your crypto and just stop looking at charts. nothing now will happen within 5 minutes or 1 hours that changes the sentiment.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cause overally, its a market problem, not a crypto problem. Crypto is doing fine, but there are so many red flags rooming, that the market is worried, and the market is an old beast, it moves slowly, so enjoy the spring and the summer, try to read up about crypto, follow the news once or twice a day but stop looking at charts.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Extreme fear is still prevalent in the market, and some people will still waste their day watching the Bitcoin price constantly.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you&amp;amp;#39;re in the Bitcoin world for the long haul, and you&amp;amp;#39;ve chosen to be a HODLer, you&amp;amp;#39;d better put the Bitcoin price aside and move on to something more productive.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Specifically, if you&amp;amp;#39;re not a trader, there&amp;amp;#39;s no point in putting yourself through this all day. The market is red, but the fundamentals of Bitcoin keep getting stronger.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The best thing to do is to continue to focus on the long term. Move on and get ready to have a relaxed weekend away from the price of Bitcoin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;PS: If you&amp;amp;#39;re a trader, good luck to you in finding sleep in the coming days :P&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I won&amp;amp;#39;t be surprised if some people didn&amp;amp;#39;t take profits just for the fear of having &amp;amp;quot;Paper hands&amp;amp;quot;.
I can&amp;amp;#39;t vouch for other communities cause I just lurk around in this sub, and you will agree with me when I say that this community scorns those who even &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;think&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; of taking profits.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now, I can bet that a lot of people here regret not listening to their &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;own intelligence&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; and taking some sweet profits before the big red hit us all this year. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We chant &amp;amp;quot;Buy the dip&amp;amp;quot; everyday in this sub, hell even in the entire crypto world, but never have I heard someone say &amp;amp;quot;Sell the rally&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So here I am, giving you all a heads up for the inevitable crypto rally this year:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;It is OKAY to take some PROFITS !&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;It is OKAY to be able to sleep at night with no regrets.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;It is OKAY to miss some extra green because you didn&amp;amp;#39;t want to risk it.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Honestly, everyone who has been there in the crypto market books profit every now and then, they just keep it a secret. And all the newbies fall for the trap called &amp;amp;quot;HODL till death&amp;amp;quot;. Just don&amp;amp;#39;t do that. Hodl isn&amp;amp;#39;t some holy grail you need to abide by all the time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;DCA and HODL is definitely a very smart strategy to invest in good projects, but don&amp;amp;#39;t forget to get your family something nice with crypto profits. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In case you fear missing out on huge pumps, best hodl &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;some&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; while booking profits on a &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;small&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; percentage of your bag. This is a win-win situation where you minimize both risk and regrets while still HODLing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Lastly, If you have extra money, Buy the Dip fellas!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

It is a fact that bitcoin trends higher with time. Therefore in a year or so we will be laughing at these prices. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We all say we’re long term investing, but I don’t think people know what a long term investment means. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This means no matter what happens, YOU DO NOT SELL. Your scope is 5-10 years maybe even 3 but that’s what a long term investment is. You don’t just start selling at a loss at the first sight of trouble. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitcoin trends up with time. If you want to win you must HODL and buy more. These are the times when millionaires are made. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You will be rewarded for buying into fear. This is not hopium, this is a fact. Throughout history whenever markets have crashed, the ones that had money to buy the crash always came out on top. Nothing is lost until you sell.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As much as this sub preaches buy high sell low. Profits are taken at the top, not at the bottom. Bitcoin will survive and recover. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However the people who bought alts that have no purpose but hype at ATH’s are in for a rude awakening.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The inflation rate is now too much to ignore as the people realize that their buying power is deteriorating faster and faster with little being done about it. As money is harder to get with the Fed reducing its balance sheet, there will be less money to invest into Crypto and the market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;The Crash Has Already Started&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When the Fed announced it was going to be raising interest rates, I warned about a market crash in a post I made just 10 days ago. Unfortunately, the crash I was talking about has already started as the stock market has started going down very intensely. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/c1prsr60x0d81.png?width=843&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=0b0b9fcffc58081d9477139f54bf4334b97e94c3&quot;&amp;gt;Nasdaq Index Falling&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The pace at which the stock market is going down can very likely cause a situation like we&amp;amp;#39;ve seen in 2008. This is going to cause panic and sell offs among people. We can already see people cashing out their stock market gains due to recent price action.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Surging Inflation and Market Crash&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If we see the history, every time there was high inflation, the Fed artificially triggered a market crash by aggressively increasing interest rates.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/wd2srkb9x0d81.png?width=982&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=628ff4587a8298793996352607cec9b84c928f16&quot;&amp;gt;Inflation and Interest rate correlation&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This rise in interest rate and the planned decrease of the Fed&amp;amp;#39;s balance sheet is going to have a severe impact on the market as people start borrowing less, spending less and investments into all assets start to dwindle.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Biden Approval Rating&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/tbvvccadx0d81.png?width=1281&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e10b55e73781fccb335a8fb7f7203a709023a84b&quot;&amp;gt;Approval Ratings Fall Sharply Due To Inflation Concerns&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With more and more inflation, people are losing trust in the Government and the approval rating is going down. The main reason behind this huge fall in approval rating is inflation, and the government needs to tackle inflation if they want to keep their approval rating from falling even lower as the public takes notice of their bills. The approval rating is a sign that the government needs to do tackle inflation if it wants to keep public support.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;The Sell-off and the Opportunity&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With the market crash ahead being very likely, people are taking their money out faster and faster. The Fed is no longer giving them free money very soon. The amount of people that are buying assets very low considering the current situation, and it is likely going to start going down as the interest rates are yet to be increased, which is when we will see the peak effects of the upcoming crash.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However, when crashes are at their peak, they leave most assets EXTREMELY undervalued. These are the times when you want to dump money into things like Crypto, which can rise extremely fast during a bullish market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Crypto&amp;amp;#39;s Correspondence With the Stock Market&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Cryptocurrency market is strongly correlated with the stock market, especially after more and more institutions have started to invest in Crypto. The Crypto market WILL react if there is a downtrend in the general economy. That is basically the reason we saw another dip in Crypto&amp;amp;#39;s prices today.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;TLDR&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;: The Fed will be tightening its monetary policies due to inflation and the stock market has started to crash. With the stock market starting to go down, we&amp;amp;#39;re already seeing the Crypto market react today, and unfortunately if the general market continues to dip, so will Crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As far as I remember, Bitcoin was thought to be the solution of the fact that institutions, wall street and big money control the financial world and the pennies of the simple people from the normal population. And it was more or less like this, in the first several years after the inception of Bitcoin. We saw so much price discovery, Bitcoin being volatile, because mere mortals like us were buying, hodling, selling, wondering how much the &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;real&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; price of this asset is. It was literally supply and demand, controlled only by the psychology and the individual decisions of every single one of us.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What do we see nowadays? We go to bed, we wake up and we see that Bitcoin is at -10% for no reason. Literally for no reason. Neither me or you have sold. We were just sleeping. What happens? Bitcoin is strongly tied to the trading algorithms of insitutions and they handle it the same way they handle stocks. If the stock market is supposed to move down, bitcoin and crypto in general follows instantly in a nanosecond. We are not in control anymore. It doesn&amp;amp;#39;t matter if we buy or sell.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;During the last few years, we welcomed institutional interest and we cheered. Now I realize that they have much more power than us and the situation is the same as it has ever been - big money controls the pennies, or in this case the satoshis, of us - the simple people.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It makes me sad, but in the end, this is an open and free market. Everybody has the right to buy, sell or hold as much as he or she wants. In this case, it just happens so that the big players choose to be massively invested in crypto, which gives us the spot on the sidelines - sit and observe how the price fluctuates, without being able to react on our own.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;EDIT: I agree with a lot of you guys and girls. The same way sometimes we go to bed, wake up and see that Bitcoin is +15%. In those green days, nobody complains about it. What concerns me in overall is how tied the price movement of crypto assets to the price movement traditional assets is. I am not sure if this is an issue to be concerned about. However, it&amp;amp;#39;s a fact and I feel the necessity to talk about it and discuss it&amp;amp;#39;s impact.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;OK the price is low right now, prices have been falling and the whole market is fearful. Some people much smarter than me would say that this the time to buy, because this is when people get rich. Buy when there is blood on the street. Be greedy when others are fearful. That&amp;amp;#39;s all good and well, but for the rest of us that are fully invested - what the hell is happening?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;The Fed&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The US federal reserve recently announced that they will begin hiking interest rates and tapering their purchases of securities - why does this affect cryptocurrencies? The current economic environment was one of extraordinary monetary policy. The money printer was on full throttle and interest rates were at near zero for a huge amount of time. What was the cost of this? inflation. Now that inflation is up, the money printer has to be shut off, and interest rates have to be hiked. This is bad news for companies with a lot of debt (like tech stocks with high future growth priced in). So traders, hedge funds, retail investors start cutting trades, and taking profit. Also to fund their safer bets they need to sell riskier assets... it&amp;amp;#39;s a risk off environment. So risk is coming off, what is perceived as the riskiest asset out there? Cryptocurrencies. So we see trades unwind, as people panic. For context this is not just SCLP, or cryptocurrencies. At the time of writing NFLX is down 20%...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/0xv9rhv890d81.png?width=1326&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=123fcb75d5657b94cc30fbd290db5a83629f5753&quot;&amp;gt;Risk off&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The S&amp;amp;amp;P has broken out of a long term channel ..&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/rb7fw46e90d81.png?width=2754&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=0063b1a820fe2912fc41de401eb4b663ceb86f9c&quot;&amp;gt;Left chart is S&amp;amp;amp;P - which defines risk in the market, bitcoin is a much smaller market and so follows in its wake.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;So what should I do?&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Ask yourself a few simple questions - what is my investment horizon? What is my long term view on cryptocurrencies, and my chosen projects?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You need to look for projects that are tangible. You need to look for projects that you believe in. If you are feeling a mental strain, perhaps this is your first foray into the crypto markets - I would suggest making sure your investments are not too much for you to mentally handle. If you feel you are too at risk, then rebalance into less risky assets. Buy some bonds, which will do well in the increased interest rate environment. Then take a walk, live your life. The markets are volatile, they go up and they go down, but fear won&amp;amp;#39;t control the market forever. Think about why you invested in the space in the first place and ask yourself, has anything changed?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;We are in this together&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You are not alone. We will profit together, and people will think that the journey there was so easy - but we have to suffer to get there, which is something that the everyday person doesn&amp;amp;#39;t get. The pain we had to face along the way. It&amp;amp;#39;s a tale as old as crypto. Stay strong!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yes the BTC $100k dream is long dead for now but that doesn’t mean your investment isn’t a good one. You still have the same amount of coins which historically should again achieve the price you bought them at.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;People need to try and stay calm, if you plan on doing a trade it would be advisable to think about it, maybe delay 24h and see if it still feels like the right decision. Emotion trading often leads to bad decisions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you are feeling down definitely talk to family and friends for support.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;1. Feign ignorance.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Scenario: In a facetime call with your father and he asks you how &amp;amp;quot;that bitmoney of yours is doing&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Response: &amp;amp;quot;Bitmoney? Haha (fake laughter) you mean &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;bitcoin&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; dad. I was just joking about getting into it. What is it even?&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;2. Lie&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Scenario: Your mother texts you asking what you did with Grandpa&amp;amp;#39;s inheritance.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Response: &amp;amp;quot;Oh (stalling language to give you more time to assemble your thoughts), I put it into a high-yield savings account. Why? Will you be needing it in about 9-10 months time?&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;3. Redirect&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Scenario: You leave your desk for a cup of coffee and your co-worker shouts &amp;amp;quot;Hey! It&amp;amp;#39;s Mr. Funny-Money!&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Response: &amp;amp;quot;Hey! It&amp;amp;#39;s Mr. Give-his-wife-a-black-eye-so-she-leaves-with-the-kids!&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;4. Run&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Scenario: Your wife is asking what happened to the money for the trip to Italy you were saving up for anniversary.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Response: &amp;amp;quot;Hang on I need to take a piss (do not go to the bathroom, but instead leave the house and run to a neighboring city and register under a new identity)&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;5. Hide&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Scenario: Your brother-in-law has tracked you down under your new identity of &amp;amp;quot;Janice Maria Juan Hernandez&amp;amp;quot; a trans-sexual erotic dancer, and phones you on your cell-phone.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Response: Do not pick up.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;6. Gas-light&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Scenario: Your boss is concerned about you because she noticed you stopped talking about cryptocurrency even though you were raving all about it throughout 2021.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Response: &amp;amp;quot;What? You were the one telling me about it. Don&amp;amp;#39;t you remember &amp;amp;#39;HODL, HODL&amp;amp;#39; and &amp;amp;#39;to the moon!&amp;amp;#39;? You were saying it all the time! (surreptitiously place your &amp;amp;#39;No sell &amp;amp;#39;til LAMBO&amp;amp;#39; mug on her desk) Look! Remember parading this around last summer?&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;7. Talk sense&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Scenario: Some drunk walks up to you on the street and says &amp;amp;quot;Cryptocurrencies are a fucking fraud man! I put all my savings into them and lost everything!&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Response: &amp;amp;quot;Listen you degenerate urchin (clinch to deflect his attack), a bear market is a natural process of any economic environment (duck a punch). If you can&amp;amp;#39;t handle the bear and hold, you don&amp;amp;#39;t deserve the bull&amp;amp;#39;s gold (parry his knife with your child).&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;8. Admit that maybe you are over-leveraged and that ultimately your life is more important than money.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Scenario: The police are speaking to you over a loudspeaker as you stand on the rooftop of your 12 floor office building.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Response: &amp;amp;quot;I&amp;amp;#39;ll come down for a crunch wrap supreme, chicken quesadilla, loaded fries, and a case of beer. NO CILANTRO. I SWEAR I&amp;amp;#39;LL JUMP IF YOU SCREW THIS UP.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With these steps in mind, hopefully you can stall long enough until your portfolio recovers and you can face your friends/relatives/parole officers with a straight face again.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Like 5 minutes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So of course everyone who have invested more than they could afford to lose are uncertain what to do so expect to a lot of posts like, even though it keeps being said that you should only invest what wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t affect your financial situation if you lose.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There&amp;amp;#39;s a huge difference between losing 10k or $1000, so of course you&amp;amp;#39;d prefer losing less and not being affected by the crash, or possibly a bear market which won&amp;amp;#39;t recover for a long time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s also a great time to buy in my opinion, even though I&amp;amp;#39;m just speculating as everyone else and we might drop to 10k&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
