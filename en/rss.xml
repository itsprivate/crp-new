&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Moreover, if you are mining, you cannot treat the mining infrastructure investment as costs. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This nonsense is on top of a flat 30% capital gains taxes and 1% TDS. Moreover, as per the full laws, you cannot carry forward losses to another year as well. Now it seems even in the same year, you cannot adjust it with gains from another asset. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The government is on a path of de-facto killing crypto by over regulation. If you make the taxes so high and the compliance so expensive, no one will ever invest in crypto - that seems to be the thought process of this utter shit government. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

@peter_szilagyi
Mar 18  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Complexity is an often overlooked aspect of a system because usually someone else is paying the price for it, not the person creating it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But don&amp;amp;#39;t be mistaken, someone &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;is&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; paying the price - whether money, time or mental capacity. They might not be willing/able to do forever.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As with scalability, complexity also keeps trickling unseen up to the breaking point. At that time, it&amp;amp;#39;s already past the point of no return.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Complexity also has the nasty effect of causing cascading failures. Overload people too much, lose capacity, leading to even larger load.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In #Ethereum&amp;amp;#39;s history, complexity never decreased. Every EIP is piling on top. Every major change (1559, merge, sharding, verkle, stateless, L2, etc) is one more nail.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m extremely frustrated when a research proposal says &amp;amp;quot;everything&amp;amp;#39;s figured out, it&amp;amp;#39;s just engineering now&amp;amp;quot;.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As good as it feels that we&amp;amp;#39;re approaching The Merge, I must emphasize that #Ethereum is not going in a clean direction. Tangentially it&amp;amp;#39;s achieving results, but it&amp;amp;#39;s also piling complexity like there&amp;amp;#39;s no tomorrow.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If the protocol doesn&amp;amp;#39;t get slimmer, it&amp;amp;#39;s not going to make it.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I feel the root cause is the disconnect between the research and the dev teams. The former has to &amp;amp;quot;only&amp;amp;quot; dream up elegant - standalone - ideas.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The latter needs to juggle every single idea that was ever introduced, whilst surgically expanding the dimensionality of the space.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There have been engineering attempts to reduce the complexity (module split in Erigon, responsibility split in The Merge). Yet there was never an attempt to reduce the protocol complexity.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We are already past the point of anyone having a full picture of the system. This is bad.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I can&amp;amp;#39;t say what the solution is, but my 2c is to stop adding features and start culling, even at the expense of breaking things.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There are less and less people knowing and willing to piece together a broken network. And each change pushes more away. /FIN  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I don&amp;amp;#39;t know what it is about crypto that makes people who devote their whole persona and personality to it such annoying douchebags. It&amp;amp;#39;s much more prominent with NFT guys online, but it&amp;amp;#39;s true for crypto as well. It just gives you a bad name, and I don&amp;amp;#39;t think being the crypto guy is conductive to anything good in social situations. It just makes you look like a loser, and more often than not you are one if you make crypto your whole personality.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Just my two cents. Some people could really stand to calm down a bit with crypto as their personality.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Price Analysis:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The price fluctuates with the DeFi market, outperforming the Defi Index (&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;DEFIPERP, FTX&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;) significantly during from Jan 2020 to Nov 2021.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The price significantly rose after rumors of a GME partnership, however, this has not yet materialized resulting in the price to underperform the Defi Index and underperformon positive news around fundamentals (i.e. wallet release, large amount of traded volume, etc…)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The below graph outlines some news articles and previous project milestones (note: this is nowhere near exhaustive):&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/xr09fpvgqmo81.png?width=2642&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=272f233de91423f101887e54d8b2d653a31c3f06&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/xr09fpvgqmo81.png?width=2642&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=272f233de91423f101887e54d8b2d653a31c3f06&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Runway:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Two funding rounds (2017 &amp;amp;amp; 2018) raised 45 Million from a total of 10 investors. No post-ICO funding has been provided.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;As per the vesting schedule tokens are locked for two years after ICO (were locked until Aug 2019) and then were released monthly over a two month period (i.e. until Aug 2021). Note that allocation to investors had no lockup.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Ongoing Development:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Although there is no clear roadmap with definitive dates for 2022 the following development items are highlighted for a 2022 release:

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Continuing to invest resource into the NFT space including Counterfactual NFT&amp;amp;#39;s&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Loopring HQ releasing in Decentraland&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;More direct bridges to LRC (easier to move funds in and out)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Multi-layered wallet&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Google trends for &amp;amp;quot;Loopring&amp;amp;quot; worldwide over the last 12 months is showing steadily decreased interest since the GME partnership rumor&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Large proportion of the community was brought in during the GME rumor and this is reflected in the posts and conversaiton&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Max supply is 1.37 Billion and 97% of this is circulating&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Overall (&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;disclaimer: this is my analysis of the above information&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;This is a solid project in relation to L2 solutions.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The transition into the NFT space is in line with the original product  niche (i.e. offering low cost solutions to L1&amp;amp;#39;s)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The GME announcement significantly skewed the crypto price with zero fundamentals backing it up. This in turn overshadowed fundamental improvements to the project in later days.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We all dream that we don&amp;amp;#39;t have to go to work, but that we have enough money for a quality life and the costs of life when you have a family.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you don&amp;amp;#39;t already have a lot of money, if you are not already rich, then how can you live on passive income? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It takes a lot of luck, effort and work to reach a level where a person can say that he no longer has to work and that he can live freely from passive income. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The real question is how to get that passive income.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What exactly is passive income?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Mining is one of the ways of passive income, but even here you have to buy quality equipment, take care of it, be there if needed, if there is a power outage or something like that. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you get crazy rich by trading cryptocurrencies, then you can stake that crypto, but only if you succeed in that, and that is not easy.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But some people as me are just celebrating it because its naturally making us happy. We already know that in the long term there done day will be a new ATH and till then we will celebrate every step that brings us there. That does not mean that we are unaware of the current bearish situation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s is nothing bad about having fun to see even the smallest pump as long as you don&amp;amp;#39;t become illusive and use that pump to justify a moon shot.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Although, precious metals slowly started losing a lot of their uses in the mainstream market. And in the event that crypto goes mainstream and most people start using it, I expect the same to happen to fiat.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Its dumb to assume that fiat will completely fade away into obscurity, but it will for sure be losing a lot of dominance in favor of crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And this reality might not be too far away from happening. We’re already seeing things like crypto credit cards from platforms like Binance, Coinbase and CoinOvy gaining a lot of popularity in the mainstream market. These crypto-to-fiat bridges will give crypto a lot of exposure and help make the transition to full in crypto payments much easier and smoother.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Every time I read it, I end up crying. Hal was paralyzed by this time and he was typing this message using an eye-tracking device.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“I thought I&amp;amp;#39;d write about the last four years, an eventful time for Bitcoin and me.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For those who don&amp;amp;#39;t know me, I&amp;amp;#39;m Hal Finney. I got my start in crypto working on an early version of PGP, working closely with Phil Zimmermann. When Phil decided to start PGP Corporation, I was one of the first hires. I would work on PGP until my retirement. At the same time, I got involved with the Cypherpunks. I ran the first cryptographically based anonymous remailer, among other activities.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fast forward to late 2008 and the announcement of Bitcoin. I&amp;amp;#39;ve noticed that cryptographic graybeards (I was in my mid 50&amp;amp;#39;s) tend to get cynical. I was more idealistic; I have always loved crypto, the mystery and the paradox of it.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When Satoshi announced Bitcoin on the cryptography mailing list, he got a skeptical reception at best. Cryptographers have seen too many grand schemes by clueless noobs. They tend to have a knee jerk reaction.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I was more positive. I had long been interested in cryptographic payment schemes. Plus I was lucky enough to meet and extensively correspond with both Wei Dai and Nick Szabo, generally acknowledged to have created ideas that would be realized with Bitcoin. I had made an attempt to create my own proof of work based currency, called RPOW. So I found Bitcoin facinating.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When Satoshi announced the first release of the software, I grabbed it right away. I think I was the first person besides Satoshi to run bitcoin. I mined block 70-something, and I was the recipient of the first bitcoin transaction, when Satoshi sent ten coins to me as a test. I carried on an email conversation with Satoshi over the next few days, mostly me reporting bugs and him fixing them.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Today, Satoshi&amp;amp;#39;s true identity has become a mystery. But at the time, I thought I was dealing with a young man of Japanese ancestry who was very smart and sincere. I&amp;amp;#39;ve had the good fortune to know many brilliant people over the course of my life, so I recognize the signs.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After a few days, bitcoin was running pretty stably, so I left it running. Those were the days when difficulty was 1, and you could find blocks with a CPU, not even a GPU. I mined several blocks over the next days. But I turned it off because it made my computer run hot, and the fan noise bothered me. In retrospect, I wish I had kept it up longer, but on the other hand I was extraordinarily lucky to be there at the beginning. It&amp;amp;#39;s one of those glass half full half empty things.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The next I heard of Bitcoin was late 2010, when I was surprised to find that it was not only still going, bitcoins actually had monetary value. I dusted off my old wallet, and was relieved to discover that my bitcoins were still there. As the price climbed up to real money, I transferred the coins into an offline wallet, where hopefully they&amp;amp;#39;ll be worth something to my heirs.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Speaking of heirs, I got a surprise in 2009, when I was suddenly diagnosed with a fatal disease. I was in the best shape of my life at the start of that year, I&amp;amp;#39;d lost a lot of weight and taken up distance running. I&amp;amp;#39;d run several half marathons, and I was starting to train for a full marathon. I worked my way up to 20+ mile runs, and I thought I was all set. That&amp;amp;#39;s when everything went wrong.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My body began to fail. I slurred my speech, lost strength in my hands, and my legs were slow to recover. In August, 2009, I was given the diagnosis of ALS, also called Lou Gehrig&amp;amp;#39;s disease, after the famous baseball player who got it.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;ALS is a disease that kills moter neurons, which carry signals from the brain to the muscles. It causes first weakness, then gradually increasing paralysis. It is usually fatal in 2 to 5 years. My symptoms were mild at first and I continued to work, but fatigue and voice problems forced me to retire in early 2011. Since then the disease has continued its inexorable progression.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Today, I am essentially paralyzed. I am fed through a tube, and my breathing is assisted through another tube. I operate the computer using a commercial eyetracker system. It also has a speech synthesizer, so this is my voice now. I spend all day in my power wheelchair. I worked up an interface using an arduino so that I can adjust my wheelchair&amp;amp;#39;s position using my eyes.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It has been an adjustment, but my life is not too bad. I can still read, listen to music, and watch TV and movies. I recently discovered that I can even write code. It&amp;amp;#39;s very slow, probably 50 times slower than I was before. But I still love programming and it gives me goals. Currently I&amp;amp;#39;m working on something Mike Hearn suggested, using the security features of modern processors, designed to support &amp;amp;quot;Trusted Computing&amp;amp;quot;, to harden Bitcoin wallets. It&amp;amp;#39;s almost ready to release. I just have to do the documentation.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And of course the price gyrations of bitcoins are entertaining to me. I have skin in the game. But I came by my bitcoins through luck, with little credit to me. I lived through the crash of 2011. So I&amp;amp;#39;ve seen it before. Easy come, easy go.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That&amp;amp;#39;s my story. I&amp;amp;#39;m pretty lucky overall. Even with the ALS, my life is very satisfying. But my life expectancy is limited. Those discussions about inheriting your bitcoins are of more than academic interest. My bitcoins are stored in our safe deposit box, and my son and daughter are tech savvy. I think they&amp;amp;#39;re safe enough. I&amp;amp;#39;m comfortable with my legacy.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Ape coin is trending all over the place, so now would be a good time to look at the past performance of popular memecoins and see why it&amp;amp;#39;s a bad idea to ape into Apecoin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Technical Analysis&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;But that dogecoin guy became a millionaire by investing his life savings in cute doggo token&amp;amp;quot;. Well here&amp;amp;#39;s a chart for Dogecoin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/1mrvbri4ldo81.png?width=1020&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=0e3b93bea732d7693b0f879eb7a82ad0d74d4618&quot;&amp;gt;DOGE/BTC Chart | Binance | Heikin Ashi&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;No surprises here. Dogecoin has been bleeding against Bitcoin for almost a year now. That means, investors who bought doge, took an &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;incredibly&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; higher risk(than btc investors) and got &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;worse&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; returns. I can&amp;amp;#39;t think of any financial asset with worse risk-adjusted-returns. In short, if you&amp;amp;#39;re investing in altcoins, you would want your alt to perform as well as BTC or better since they are inherently riskier.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here&amp;amp;#39;s a similar story for Shiba Inu:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/vk43wo69ndo81.png?width=1180&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=cdd403bf08f3138d87b8d1bfa75a9865f3d6cbba&quot;&amp;gt;SHIB/BTC Chart | Binance | Heikin Ashi&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As seen in the previous chart, we can see an initial few days of hype, and then a continuous bleed against BTC.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Fundamental Analysis&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Timing&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now is probably the worst time to invest in highly speculative assets. The terrible Russia-Ukraine war is happening, and the global economy and supply chains are heavily affected due to that.  Taking an excessive amount of financial risk at this moment is the last thing you&amp;amp;#39;d want to do.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Lastly, if you&amp;amp;#39;re playing the short term game, you have already lost. Like all financial markets, crypto will transfer wealth from the impatient to the patient investor.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TLDR: Don&amp;amp;#39;t buy ApeCoin or any meme-coins. You&amp;amp;#39;re likely going to regret it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Apparently the new &amp;amp;#39;Spending Power&amp;amp;#39; feature let&amp;amp;#39;s you take a crypto loan using your staked coins as collateral... with 0% interest if that loan is repaid within 7 days. This seems like a fairly original idea as you continue to earn interest on any coins in Earn while being allowed to use those same coins as collateral for the &amp;amp;#39;Spending Power&amp;amp;#39; loan. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;From what I&amp;amp;#39;ve read, this new feature is already rolling out in Canada and the borrow limit is tied to card tier.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;More importantly, this is a super convenient way to top up your CDC card immediately while waiting for fiat to be credited from your bank account to the CDC Fiat Wallet (and free due to that 7-day 0% interest period). &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Loans which are not repaid within 7 days then accrue interest at 9.99%.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As someone who was massively critical when CDC decreased the Earn Limit recently, that does now start to make a little more sense. More importantly, this will hopefully inspire other lenders (Nexo, etc) to start offering similar interest free loans.... &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
