&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In 2021, they funded a hit piece that claims energy prices for consumers in New York has increased by $6 per month because of mining. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/m0ta2tae4xb81.png?width=1318&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=8079d16b0fde7bc74ebd204d4362ff823da26d3f&quot;&amp;gt;Claim: Mining drives up household electricity bills&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Surely its not the soaring costs of natural gas that is driving up electricity prices, but mining? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/iprxvhfj5xb81.jpg?width=2610&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e4da2516b82eb585706d4d1af417320b5b82889e&quot;&amp;gt;Since June 2020, Natural gas prices have gone up by 350&amp;amp;#37; in the USA (Henry Hub natural gas futures rolling contracts)&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/v2gl6rmx3xb81.jpg?width=3094&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=9dae03fee6dfbbfaf58df82519db809462d01254&quot;&amp;gt;Not just in USA, in UK, natural gas is at decadal highs. &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Surely, electricity prices that consumers pay have nothing whatsoever to do with inflation, or soaring gas prices that are in decadal highs.. but is due to bitcoin mining?!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crude oil WTI futures are currently at 84, for comparison it was around 56 in Nov 2019 (pre pandemic). The last time WTI was above 80 was all the way back in 2014. Increasing crude oil natural gas prices, along with inflation that is at multi-decade high is not the reason for increase in household electricity, but its bitcoin mining that is responsible.. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/a4z5aqnyaxb81.jpg?width=1944&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=6656489541bece07a0e9b83837d42345157f987c&quot;&amp;gt;Thats according to this study funded by Ripple in collusion with the Department of Treasury. &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;... The same Department of Treasury headed by another well known Bitcoin hater Janet Yellen, who earned $7m as &amp;amp;quot;speaking fee&amp;amp;quot; from the same banks she is supposed to regulate but has tried to stifle Bitcoin and crypto at every opportunity. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Research with &amp;amp;quot;financial support&amp;amp;quot; is nothing but propaganda, especially when it&amp;amp;#39;s funded by a competitor to bitcoin that lobbies with the government. Ripple continues to be a centralised premine scam created to enrich its founders. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Ripple has also cozied up with the likes of WEF, the very organisations Bitcoin was created as a fuck you to. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.weforum.org/organizations/ripple&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.weforum.org/organizations/ripple&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As its price and narrative around the shitcoin has stagnated, Ripple is resorting to dirty political tricks to get a leg up. As usual, they will fail. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The narrative that bitcoin mining companies cause increase in electricity bills in NY is rubbish, as the largest BTC mining companies in New York produce their own energy. Infact the last one to start mining in NY is a hydro electric plant that was unused for years, before they started mining Bitcoin last year. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Mechanicville-hydro-plant-gets-new-life-16299115.php&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Mechanicville-hydro-plant-gets-new-life-16299115.php&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The other large mining company Greenidge Generation also produces its own energy.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: Buttcoin losers in comments say &amp;amp;quot;reee bitcoin move to POS or govt will ban it&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yeah not too bright, the whole point of Bitcoin is that it cant be banned unlike the proof of stake shitcoins you support that can be created out of thin air at the press of a button and shut down at the press of a button.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Another one who is literally a war monger calling for Ukraine invasion but pretends to care about global e-waste. Lmao. Bitcoin haters are really a funny bunch&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some of you may have seen my previous posts, where I open source entire projects and share them with the community if I feel like they could add value to you guys. I like doing it and it makes feel good that you guys appreciate the content so much.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Because everything that I build is open source and available for everyone, the only way that I&amp;amp;#39;ve been able to monetise my passion is by becoming a YouTube partner, and monetising my videos.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I don&amp;amp;#39;t make a huge amount, but enough to keep me hopeful that one day, it will grow and actually make a difference.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here&amp;amp;#39;s a video I just made explaining the whole thing in more detail. I&amp;amp;#39;m also using that video to raise awareness against the corrupted mess that is YouTube so if you feel like helping, feel free to show this video to other people who might not understand just how destructive these corporations are for the freedom of our Internet: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/VRJXvJnUWV8&quot;&amp;gt;https://youtu.be/VRJXvJnUWV8&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;ve recently received an e-mail from Google telling me that my Adsense account has been cancelled. For those that don&amp;amp;#39;t know, without an adsense account, you can&amp;amp;#39;t get paid by YouTube.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They haven&amp;amp;#39;t sent a warning, started in investigation, or asked me anything prior to that.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is literally all the information that they have given me:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/sba6q2jv3xb81.png?width=629&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=882822e4b75bd9d9ec128a6bb63f393a91c916ce&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/sba6q2jv3xb81.png?width=629&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=882822e4b75bd9d9ec128a6bb63f393a91c916ce&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I have appealed this decision, and got back a dry response, saying that my adsense account will not be re-instated.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I know I&amp;amp;#39;m not the first, and sadly won&amp;amp;#39;t be the last crypto YouTuber to be cancelled by google without any prior explanation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;ve spent hours reading their terms and conditions, and it doesn&amp;amp;#39;t seem that Google was ever in the right with this, making this a breach of contract.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I was always for the idea of a decentralised internet and social media, but I never realised before how much we need it, and how valuable freedom and justice truly are as given by the blockchain and decentralisation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I hope that my experience has given you the extra fuel you needed to want to search for alternative decentralised solutions in favour of the established tech giants who don&amp;amp;#39;t care about anything but their own obscene profits.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;EDIT:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;For those wanting to see proof of demonetisation and that there is no invalid traffic coming into my youtube channel:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

It shows what this sub is - not an advocate for cryptocurrency, but a thinly veiled place to be tribal and act salty when other people’s bags do well.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That’s pathetic.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is a win for cryptocurrency in general. I’ve been around this space since 2013. Back then, Bitcoiners were screaming for companies to accept cryptocurrency and price things in cryptocurrency. Then when it happens 8 years later, the primary attitude about it is salt just because the cryptocurrency of choice isn’t in the bag of certain people in the sub.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Grow up, take a step back, and recognize this as a win for cryptocurrency. We are in this together.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If it was your cryptocurrency of preference being accepted, you’d magically consider it a good thing. That’s the truth.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;The experts are saying that the stock markets are going to crash any day now&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;BTC was funded by printed money is the only reason it pumped, it will never pump again&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Blah, blah blah. Every time these lines of reason are rolled out and every time crypto pumps back up again. You wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t get this in the regular stock market, people don&amp;amp;#39;t see a recession and be all like &amp;amp;quot;well that&amp;amp;#39;s it for stocks, it&amp;amp;#39;s been all pump for 100 years but it&amp;amp;#39;s over forever now&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Well I&amp;amp;#39;ve read it all before and I don&amp;amp;#39;t see anything to worry me. The markets already down almost 50% from ATH and has been stable for 9 days and counting meaning huge gains when we set a new ATH and despite the painting the FUD want&amp;amp;#39;s to share I see that ATH hitting in this year with no issue.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

This text might contain some spoilers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;ve always heard of the movie &amp;amp;#39;the big short&amp;amp;#39; but never watched it before. I was shocked at what went down and how totally ignorant people, banks, hedge funds etc were to giving loans or investing in loans without having any liquidity behind it. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For me the most mind blowing fact is that only 1 guy went to jail, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;1 GUY!&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. Like always the average Joe ended up paying for all the shit that banks started being so greedy. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Although cryptocurrency is far from perfect it&amp;amp;#39;s a very different approach being (mostly) decentralised and trying to even the playing field for both the rich and the poor. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Have you seen the movie? What do you think of the events that happened? Curious!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

That coin that really shot up from, like, $0.15 in November 2017 to $33 two months later? It even was in the top 20 for a bit. Well, I suppose many people on here must have bought close to ATH back then, because they always REALLY wanted it to go there again and talked about their love for it a lot&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Unfortunately it never did. It was hit HARD by the bear market of 2018ff., even went below $0.4. While it did quite well in the bullrun of 2021, it was one of those coins that stayed way below their 2017-2018 ATHs, it got close to $15. Other than most other formerly huge coins that didn&amp;amp;#39;t reach a new ATH this bull run - stuff like XRP, BCH, EOS, NEO, DASH... - which don&amp;amp;#39;t get a lot of love on here, Nano stayed a sub favorite, I don&amp;amp;#39;t think any other coin outside the top 100 (except Moons) is mentioned this often.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Speaking of the top 100: you can see how much this sub loves Nano, if you read &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/og5u6m/its_official_nano_is_no_longer_among_the_top_100/&quot;&amp;gt;this post&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; from last July, when it left the top 100 - OP was at a &amp;amp;quot;loss for words&amp;amp;quot;, how could a coin that was &amp;amp;quot;perfect: Instant. Feeless. Green&amp;amp;quot; not be much higher? Many people agreed, the post has over 5k upvotes. I would argue the post was a bit dramatic - Nano hat only re-entered the top 100 3 months earlier after spending a few weeks below that - but you see how much love there is for the coin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Today, it left the top 200 for the first time since its big explosion in late 2017, as I am writing this it&amp;amp;#39;s 202 on Coingecko, -91% since ATH, the downtrend has been pretty consistent the past few months.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What do you think about Nano? Do you still believe in it, do you think it will break its ATH ever again? Do you think it&amp;amp;#39;s a dead coin that will just continue to go down? Other coins have been declared dead for less but hey, it&amp;amp;#39;s crypto, anything can happen&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Preventing      scams and fake tickets&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;: The blockchain provides a single source of truth for both organisers      and ticket holders. The transfer of NFTs from initial sale to any      subsequent resale is recorded immutably on the blockchain, so all parties      involved can easily verify the authenticity of the ticket. Even cooler, in      cases where resale of tickets is strictly forbidden, NFTs can be      programmed as non-transferrable, so they physically cannot be moved to      another buyer.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Perpetual      revenue:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; As      programmable digital assets NFTs can have built-in rules for resales,      merchandise, content and royalty splits. This means that the organiser can      determine profit sharing percentages for any future resales or downstream      creative content on secondary markets, and reliably receive these funds      knowing they are unalterable within the NFT’s coding.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;New      revenue opportunities:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; NFTs put tickets into the realm of programmable money, opening      up unlimited potential for new revenue opportunities. For example resale      of NFT tickets as &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;collectables,&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; using NFT tickets as a gateway for giving      food and drink deals, even rewarding super fans who have collected a      certain number of event tickets.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Over the past year the NFT tickets have gained more attention in the crypto space. I have compiled extensive list of developers, investors, financial instintutions, ticketing companies and NBA owners that have advocated the benefits of NFT ticketing&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is an “immutable ledger.” Think about it like a book that lives in the sky. Every time something changes, its written down with magic ink, that when dries, never changes. And there are thousands of copies of these books, all getting updated at the same time. If one is ever messed with, the other books would wipe out the problem and replace it with the correct entry.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;(Tedtalk – Blockchain Massively simplified)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mbcg.io/vision?pgid=kn921drf-2058f817-4ebc-4c29-8430-a667933ff044&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.mbcg.io/vision?pgid=kn921drf-2058f817-4ebc-4c29-8430-a667933ff044&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;What is proof of Work?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;First generation crypto currency worked of the concept of Poof of work. There, it is a race to solve a complicated math puzzle, and perform the block write operation. And as a reward get coin. “Mining.” Mining is slow. Bitcoin can only do 7 transactions a minute.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Of the thousands and thousands of machines out there racing to win the next block, only 1 at a time wins. That means the others have literally wasted their energy via compute CPU and GPU cycles. Bitcoin used more energy than Argentina last year.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
But its not all bad. POW is still the oldest and most battle tested consensus algorithm, and many ague more secure because of it. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-work.asp&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-work.asp&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56012952&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56012952&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;What is proof of Stake?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Proof of Stake works on different types of newly developed “Consensus” algorithms. Ouroboros protocol, created by IHOK and Cardano, along with a team of PHDs and mathematicians, is the first of its kind. They created a secure “lottery” consensus mechanism to “elect” the next “slot leader” to write the block. Here each Stake pool can get a chance to be elected by winning the lottery. Each Ada coin represents 1 lottery ticket. When you delegate to the pool, you give that pool your ticket, not your coin. If the pool wins, you get the reward along with everyone in the pool, and the operator. Because there is no more complicated math puzzle, and no more computers racing to solve the puzzle, its much much faster, and much much cheaper. Cardano nodes can be run on Raspberry Pi.. A lot of nodes out there run on Solar energy. It’s so good, Ethereum, who is proof of work currently, is moving to this model as part of their ETH 2.0 migration. Hopefully this summer with the &amp;amp;quot;merge.&amp;amp;quot; In efforts to reduce gas fees and energy concerns. Pokodot created its own Consensus algorithm. Called Grandpa. Tezos has its Emmy+, and the list goes on. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Each other their own way of doing things. But “gen 3” is not Proof of work.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What you should remember is that for both POW, POS, and others, they are all a means of incentivizing the actual people that run the computers hosting the blockchain code. Without them, there is no “decentralized network of immutable ledgers.” Which is because that’s just fancy talk for machines running our code to support the blockchain. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;What is Market Cap and coin supply and why should we care?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Market Capitalization is equal to Price of Coin times Supply of Coin. That is, it. But very important.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;BITCOIN has a fixed supply. It is not all mined yet. Not until 2140. But it does have a finite amount, 21 Million.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here is why you can see a 65K or even 100K bitcoin, but you’ll probably never see a 100 dollar DOGE, or even a 30 Dollar Ada (not soon anyway)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Currently there are  18,929,200 BTC out there at a cost of 43,087.16.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That means, the market cap is 43,087.16 x 18,929,200  = 815,605,469,072 (815B)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cardano, has a fixed coin supply as well. But it is 45 Billion. There are currently 33,526,814,681. So you see the max is 2500x more. Likewise, with 130B DOGE vs 18M BTC - it’s ~6700X more. DogeCoin also makes 10,000 new coins a minute.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At a price is 1.26 that means the market cap for Cardano is 1.26 X 33,526,814,681 = 42,243,786,498.06 (42B)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You’ll need 136B market cap to reach a 1-dollar DOGE in the next year.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;132,670,764,300 + ((10,000*60*24*351) = 137,725,164,300 (Supply of DOGE in 1 year from now)&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
137,725,164,300 * 1 = 137,725,164,300&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You&amp;amp;#39;ll need an almost 1 Trillion Market Cap for Cardano to hit 3032,127,627,594 * 30 = 963,828,827,820&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To give you some reference. Here is the Market cap of some big names.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Visa – 499B&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adobe – 250B&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Amazon – 1.7T&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It’s very confusing because every coin has their own supply. Their own way of creating coins and at what cadence. Some even “burn” coins. So, know what yours does and how it works.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;How can I “get in early?”&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;First. We are all early. You might not have gotten in on the first floor, but we’re only halfway up the stairs to the second flight.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Global wealth is estimated at 1 quadrillion. All the Market Cap in crypto is at 2.05 Trillion. That’s only 0.21% of the world’s wealth.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When looking for “what could be the next big thing” find something with a low market cap, regardless of coin price, that has a strong chance of doing well because of team and tech, the two Ts.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also ask yourself.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What are these coins use cases?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Who is their target audience for adoption?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Who is funding them?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Who is their team building it? What is their history?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Do they have a good plan?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://river.com/learn/how-much-worlds-money-in-bitcoin/#:%7E:text=Global%20wealth%20is%20estimated%20at,represents%200.09%25%20of%20global%20wealth&quot;&amp;gt;https://river.com/learn/how-much-worlds-money-in-bitcoin/#:~:text=Global%20wealth%20is%20estimated%20at,represents%200.09%25%20of%20global%20wealth&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;What are your goals?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto is really split into 4 worlds.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Day traders, H.O.D.L.’ers, Whales, and weak hands.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Day traders realize that this market is very volatile, now, and historically. Good ones, can capitalize on quick gains by buying low and selling high, waiting for a dip, then buying back in, and selling high again, cyclically.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then there are those that “Hold On for Dear Life.” These people tend to find something they really are passionate about, and never sell. They keep buying. If they see their coin dips, below at what they bought it at, and have some extra funds, they buy more, to &amp;amp;quot;Average Down.&amp;amp;quot; Or Dollar cost average (DCA) by buying a set amount on a regular cadence. They only “take profit” buy selling a small portion when price is really high.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Whales, are investors that come in with millions and billions of dollars. They often “test” the market buy either buying or dumping millions and billions in hopes to manipulate the market to their advantage. If you’re reading this, you’re probably not in this category, but you should know they exist and effect this marketplace.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then there are “weak hands.” Do not pick this one. These people buy high and sell low. They only invest based on emotion, and nothing else. When things start going bad, they panic, and sell at a loss. Its much better to let your coin go to .000000001 cents, and just hold on to it in the hopes of a rally years later, then it is to ever sell at a loss. Never do this. Never.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Each has its own risks and rewards.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Day trading can rack up dollars quick, but you can lose them just as quick. And there are tax implicates with trades. Some unknown, and constantly changing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;HODL, might take years, but if you do, the chance of your Return on Invest improves significantly in crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Pick what works best for you but have a plan.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://cryptocurrencyfacts.com/hodling-vs-trading-for-new-cryptocurrency-investors/&quot;&amp;gt;https://cryptocurrencyfacts.com/hodling-vs-trading-for-new-cryptocurrency-investors/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;What are things to look out for?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Do your own research&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. There are now more then 4K types of crypto currencies. You can create your own in about 30 minutes with the right free tools.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The mortality rate of new coins is super high this year. Lots of people trying to do Pump and Dumps.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There is nothing in life that goes up for no reason, if it does, it’s a Ponzi scheme.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;What is the difference between storing on an exchange or in a wallet?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A lot.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;First, you must remember what the dream of crypto is really offering.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Its offering a way for us to break away from banks. Forever.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Centralized banks that can print money, is a problem. Blockchain solves this.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But not if the new bank ends up being Binace or Coinbase. In fact, keeping your coin in exchanges puts us all at risk of market manipulation by them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When a certain 1 person or group owns too many nodes, they can make choices that would benefit them. The attack vector is called a 51% attack or sybil attack.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Today however, you need exchanges to on ramp and off ramp FIAT. FIAT money is government-issued currency that is not backed by a physical commodity, such as gold or silver.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But it will not be like that forever. Chains like ADA and DOT will be interoperable with legacy banks and will eventually cut out exchanges.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Personally, I despise BNB coin and binace. They already take high fees, and now they want the control and the rewards too. Coinbase isn’t much better. Again though, a necessary evil, for now.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But more important than the “dream” is that they can be hacked.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They are a website. Not a blockchain. They hold the keys to your wallet, and let you use them with a weak password and no mfa if you like. Its literally like storing your money in a bank. So know your bank. Good thing, like a bank, SOME, are federally insured up to a certain amount. But some are not, and people have lost millions and billions in the past this way.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Lastly, there is the notification of “passive income” and “interest.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With POS systems, delegators are incentivized to “stake” their coin by earning interest.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With POW systems, like bitcoin, you’d have to stand up your own machine, configure it, and let it use your energy in your house. With withs like Cardano Ada, and ETH 2.0, you can now pull your coin off the exchange, put it in a wallet, delegate to a pool, and earn interest. All while maintaining full control of your coins.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;What are Smart Contracts? (This one will blow your mind if you are a developer)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;First let us start with what most people say.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Which is true for sure. It helps build trust and removes the cumbersome third party “trusted agent” like a bank.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But what smart contracts really are is “ANY Code” that can be written to a blockchain and NEVER be changed, forever.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;ANY CODE. You can write your own coins and put them into the block. It happens a lot.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Games, sure, put in the chain. Check out CryptoKitties.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the future ALL business will be blockchain businesses. Every transaction, every process in the building and distribution, will be written to a magic book that can’t be messed with.. Ever..&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;What are NFTs?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;NonFungible Tokens is metadata attached to an asset. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The metadata is things like who created it, and when. Along with the most important piece the link to the asset. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The asset is what most people think of when they talk about NFTs.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
Its a digital file. Like a jpg or a mov file.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
But its not stored in the blockchain like most assume.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
Instead they are stored, most often, in IPFS storage.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
IPFS is very cool, but its not blockchain, and thus not &amp;amp;quot;immutable.&amp;amp;quot; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So what’s the big deal? I can upload a gif to the internet today.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The big deal is twofold.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;First, you are not uploading anything to the “internet.” That whole thing we call the internet is flawed. Tracked, centralized, monitored, and gated.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What you are doing is creating an EARLY entry, in a book that will never change for the rest of time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Let us sit and think about that for a second.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;De Beers is going to have to get new slogan. “A &amp;lt;del&amp;gt;diamond&amp;lt;/del&amp;gt; NFT is forever”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Right now, it is some awful GIF of a dogecoin. But it is not what it is. It is what it represents.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is the next chapter in Art history. What is created will last longer than the Mona Lisa. Someday you will have blockchain archaeologist that comb though chains.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Plus, taking away the cool factor, they create a place that you can now prove you did it first.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Artist could upload lyrics as an NFT, and later sell them, without the fear their art might be stolen before a contract is in place. People could attach their house deed to a chain, and ever again dispute who owns the land after a conflict.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Besides gaming, NFTs are frequently used to sell a wide range of virtual collectibles, including NBA virtual trading cards, music, digital images, video clips and even virtual real estate in &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://decentraland.org/&quot;&amp;gt;Decentraland&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, a virtual world.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That of course is the rosier outlook on NFTs.   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Unfortunately, in practice there are many gaps today.   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The first I already mentioned. The asset is not stored in the blockchain.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
What that means is that the IPFS provider could &amp;amp;quot;unpin&amp;amp;quot; your asset, and if its not saved anywhere else, you&amp;amp;#39;ll end up with an NFT that has metadata that points to a url that has nothing there.   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The second problem, is that there are thousands of blockchains. People can take your asset, because its publicly pined, and then go create an NFT on another blockchain, and then claim theirs is in fact the original. You&amp;amp;#39;d have to check every chain that supports NFTs to ensure it was in fact the first first.   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Or people have taken hard artwork, like paintings, and then minted and sold them as NFTs. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Terminology?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;HODL = Hold On for Dear Life&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
Hopium  =  Represents the belief that the situation will someday improve.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
FOMO = Fear of Missing Out&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
FUD = Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
Bear/Bearish =  &amp;amp;quot;Bears&amp;amp;quot; believe that an asset, for example a digital currency, will decline in value.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
Bull/Bullish =  If a trader believes that an asset will rise in value, he or she is a &amp;amp;quot;bull.&amp;amp;quot; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If one posts “LUL Solana is so garbage Ethereum never went down” for when Solana went down, but then post “it’s no big deal stuff happens” for when Harmony went down, that’s just desperate hypocritical behavior. Either hold them both accountable for the same problem, or don’t hold either accountable. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It’s easy to pass on circle-jerking sub and shilling random coins on this sub, but this one is just too sad and disgusting to look over imo.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here&amp;amp;#39;s what Tesla &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;will&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; be accepting DOGE for:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) will accept meme-based cryptocurrency dogecoin as payment for its &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;merchandise&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; such as the &amp;amp;quot;Giga Texas&amp;amp;quot; belt buckle and mini models of electric vehicles, Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said in a tweet on Friday.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In other words, you can buy a few Tesla toys and a belt buckle like this one (835 DOGE):&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://shop.tesla.com/product/giga-texas-belt-buckle?sku=1758879-00-A&quot;&amp;gt;https://shop.tesla.com/product/giga-texas-belt-buckle?sku=1758879-00-A&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;DOGE had a predictable and modest 20% gain following the non news &amp;amp;#39;news&amp;amp;#39;, which probably enabled Elon to lighten his bags yet again.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Preface&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the top 40 tokens ranked by market cap only 6 aren’t on Ethereum, with those being on the Binance smart chain, but this makes sense, if you were opening a shop in real life, you’d want to do it where the people are, and not in the middle of the countryside. Ethereum, while long maintaining it’s position as the largest smart contract chain does have its problems, those being gas fees and congestion.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This means that while anything built on Ethereum gets the benefits of decentralisation and security, it inherits those problems too.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;DEXs are in my opinion though are some of the most important aspects to the free trade of crypto, allowing for swapping between any on chain, or wrapped asset, but if you wanted to perform a trade on uniswap now you’d be paying well over $150 in fees.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And this is where loopring comes in, aiming to not only solve these existing problems and provide a completely new take on how DEX’s should function.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Foundation&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Like a lot of the current markets most promising protocols, Loopring, created by Daniel Wang an ex google software engineer, first appeared in the form of an ICO in the 2017 bull run raising 45 million. Unfortunately, Daniel and his team are based in Shanghai, and as we all know China loves to flip flop on their crypto regulation, coming out with new laws outlawing ICO’s forcing the Loopring Foundation to refund most of the funds earnt. However, from the ICO there was 20k Ethereum not refunded, which at the time was worth around 7.5 million, and with this they forged on with the creation of the Loopring protocol.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Unlike a lot of projects in the crypto space that start their marketing extremely early to try and hook investors sometimes before the product even has a working first version, Looping’s focus was on creating the product and then letting it sell itself. Arguably had the market not become so crowded with people almost acting like salesmen trying to shove any half-baked crypto project down people’s throats this strategy probably would’ve worked.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This isn’t to say that the company isn’t starting to move towards providing a greater feature set such as Ethereum virtual machine compatibility but given how tight lipped they’ve been on the topic shows that they don’t want this to dominate the narrative of what the platform actually currently does.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Loopring Protocol&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Loopring aims to give anyone the tools to build their own DEX but without needing to go through any of the problems in actually starting a DEX, Loopring is to decentralised exchanges what the Tendermint SDK is to Proof of stake. Its certainly not the only way to do it, but it cuts out a large portion of the groundwork required.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At the core of Loopring is a Zero Knowledge Proof rollup layer built on top of the Ethereum base chain, since not many people know what this actually is or entails, I thought Id briefly explain it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Zero Knowledge proof is not unique to crypto, it in fact pre-dates it by over 25 years, and is a cryptographic protocol that allows a party to prove that a statement is true to a recipient party, what makes it significant though is that the recipient party doesn’t need to be privy to any potentially secret information that goes into proving the statement.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Think of it like a magic trick, if a magician said he could predict the suit and number of a card we will draw from a deck of cards, and then proceeds to do it and get it right, we can assume that it wasn’t just sheer luck, and that he can in fact do what he says he can, but we as the second party have no idea how the trick was done.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So when we apply this to crypto we get the ability to prove to the base chain that something happening on a side chain or layer 2 is verifiably true, which as we all know is extremely important in a trustless environment like a blockchain.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So now we move onto the rollup part, on the base chain, in this case Ethereum, a transaction is a single monetary transfer from a to b, this means that to process 100 transfers, you need 100 transactions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A much more efficient way of doing this would be to process 100 transfers and put them all through at once under a single transaction. The problem with doing this however is the blockchain can only verify the transaction and not data within the event log of the transaction and so in this case it would assume the 100 transactions are all invalid and reject them unless it could be proven otherwise.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So, to combine this all together, a zkRollup works by performing transactions off chain, and then submitting them back to the main chain as a single transaction with the proof required to confirm that what happened off chain still conforms to the base chain’s rules, and that they’re all valid transactions so that the base chain can process them accordingly as though it had done the work itself.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This technology is what Loopring uses along with Relayers to allow anyone to create a DEX and keep gas fees low.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At the core of everything is the loopring relayer. The relayer is in charge of virtually everything in the ecosystem, from generating the proofs, building blocks, matching orderbooks and more.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The loopring protocol will work with any relayer, however there is currently a single canonical relayer being used which is run by the Loopring foundation, now I do have some concerns about this which I will, as usual, cover at the end, but all you need to know is that the Loopring protocol is entirely non-custodial.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Token Supply and Distribution&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There’s currently 1.2 billion LRC in circulation, which is 100 million less than the max supply of 1.3 billion which is due to the fact that a portion of the supply has been burnt.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Any operation the loopring protocol will incur a fee, same as performing any action on the blockchain, in the case of Loopring this is just 0.3% of the transaction value, where 0.2% is returned to the liquidity providers as incentive and 0.1% goes to the loopring DAO.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The use of the LRC value held by the Loopring DAO is voted on, with the options for its use being grants to incentivize partnerships, impermanent loss protection, liquidity incentives on top of the 0.2% fee, and then finally burning LRC.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Concerns&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Firstly, despite the protocol being Relayer agnostic, that is to say that anyone can build a relayer and start to perform network actions, the only current Relayer operated by the Loopring foundation. This unfortunately does mean that there’s a centralised aspect to the network as it currently stands.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now, hopefully I’ve done a good enough job of explaining why this isn’t an immediate red flag for the platform, given that the entire point is to be non-custodial and have layers on layers of protocol specifics to ensure that control is always entirely in the user’s hands, I just personally don’t like the fact that the security of an investment into LRC would depend on the Loopring foundation upkeeping that relayer.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And my second concern is to do with marketting.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As it stands currently loopring has $450m locked within the contract, which for a project sitting at 2.1 billion market cap is lower than I would’ve expected. Take Curve for example, which is sitting only 100 million dollars higher in market cap but has over 20 billion dollars locked by it’s contract on Ethereum alone.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This on its own might not be cause for concern but the DEX created by the Loopring foundation was born out of being unable to secure partners to build their own DEX’s and show off the platform. This to me shows that for the platform to survive, more of an emphasis needs to be placed on getting the protocol out into the wider DeFi audience and not just within the retail space where it currently seems to be sitting.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/h4fzamv48nb81.png?width=720&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=398e4817bbbf0c7b7e821fa30e710c2930005165&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/h4fzamv48nb81.png?width=720&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=398e4817bbbf0c7b7e821fa30e710c2930005165&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The increase of campaigns is massive: on this day in 2021 there were 1359 campaigns running.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This means a plus of over 300% in one year!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Calculated for half a year, taking the 14th of June 2021 as the day, we see 4085 campaigns.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Which in turn gives us a growth of over 35% in 6 month!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Of course not all the regions have the same amount of ads shown. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;the top 10 regions are as following:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/gsxkcgjg8nb81.jpg?width=1030&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=6d3aacaa3133c0de75773268e33d6ed876b1aead&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/gsxkcgjg8nb81.jpg?width=1030&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=6d3aacaa3133c0de75773268e33d6ed876b1aead&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To find out how many and what ads are being shown in your region, visit  &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://sampson.codes/brave/ads/my_region/&quot;&amp;gt;Brave Ads in My Region (sampson.codes)&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; .&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To see examples of ads run around the world, visit  &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://brave.photos/&quot;&amp;gt;Home - Brave browser sponsored image archive&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Ad campaigns are bought with BAT or the any other currency, which will be exchanged to BAT by Brave. Brave in turn will redistribute the earned BAT as rewards to the users.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The digital ad industry today is worth hundreds of billions, and will grow to a trillion+ dollar industry this decade.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Those numbers are really bullish for the future of Brave and its token BAT, and i feel like the future is really bright for this project!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Of course a few of them might have the potential to give you great returns, but a lot of people completely end up ignoring the risk factor. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;CryptoMoonShots vs &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/Cryptocurrency&quot;&amp;gt;r/Cryptocurrency&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/azvhoo2o3nb81.png?width=1099&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=d6668d709c5ff7f2f82bd1a4ef1ce276700af48d&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/azvhoo2o3nb81.png?width=1099&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=d6668d709c5ff7f2f82bd1a4ef1ce276700af48d&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The CryptoMoonShots subreddit has even started to outpace the Cryptocurrency subreddit in terms of growth. It is a terrible thing to see considering the vast majority of the cryptocurrencies advertised there there are complete scam projects. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Don&amp;amp;#39;t get me wrong. Some low market coins do have great utility and great future potential, but when you start going lower into the low millions or hundreds of thousands, the risk far outweighs their benefits.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you are new to Crypto, the best thing you can do in Crypto is DCA and accumulate larger projects for the long term. Crypto is not the stock market, and deviating away from trusted projects or trying to rely on technical analysis is very risky.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TLDR: Unfortunately a lot of the newbies that are joining Crypto are completely ignoring even top 100 coins and are choosing to put their money in these shady &amp;amp;quot;get rich quick&amp;amp;quot; schemes which is nothing short of gambling.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Ripple lawsuit&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Ripple, meanwhile, has been embroiled in an infamous lawsuit with the US SEC for over a year. The SEC accuses Ripple of selling securities in the past without the necessary licenses. At the moment, Ripple is hopeful that the lawsuit will soon come to an end and the judge will finally issue a ruling. However, Alderoty lashed out at the SEC on Twitter. He believes that the SEC does not want the court case to end any time soon.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/jisowqdswhb81.png?width=498&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=4e9c680ce369d60ff1003268f0fa06d86912468a&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/jisowqdswhb81.png?width=498&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=4e9c680ce369d60ff1003268f0fa06d86912468a&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Gary Gensler&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the series of Twitter messages, Alderoty responds to a message from SEC Chairman Gary Gensler. Gensler revealed why, in his opinion, enforcement of rules is one of the SEC&amp;amp;#39;s most important tasks. Soccer without referees would turn into an unfair occupation in no time according to Gensler. If teams don&amp;amp;#39;t have to worry about penalties and enforcement of the rules, things will go wrong. The same goes for the markets, according to Gensler. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/dmwxeixuwhb81.png?width=509&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=0ef5caa037c3fe6e1f067f0eed849ae04b274c14&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/dmwxeixuwhb81.png?width=509&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=0ef5caa037c3fe6e1f067f0eed849ae04b274c14&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Alderoty argues that the SEC is guilty of &amp;amp;quot;regulation by enforcement.&amp;amp;quot; That by simply initiating a lawsuit against an entity they are trying to control certain markets. This is also why, according to Alderoty, the SEC does not seem to be in any particular hurry in the lawsuit.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Ripple&amp;amp;#39;s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, still seemed convinced in November of last year that the lawsuit will end this year. In addition, he is hopeful that the judge&amp;amp;#39;s ruling will also be in Ripple&amp;amp;#39;s favor.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Is there a solution to this? Perhaps&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We also think there is very high stakes game theory at play here, whereby if bitcoin adoption increases, the countries that secure some bitcoin today will be better off competitively than their peers. Therefore, even if other countries do not believe in the investment thesis or adoption of bitcoin, they will be forced to acquire some as a form of insurance. In other words, a small cost can be paid today as a hedge compared to a potentially much larger cost years in the future. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;We therefore wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t be surprised to see other sovereign nation states acquire bitcoin in 2022 and perhaps even see a central bank make an acquisition.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I did this a few times actually without  issues. It seemed as reliable as any exchange - pancake swap, 1inch,  uniswap,  raydium, etc...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The site was even verified by Haze crypto when I used it months ago, but it has since been updated and now warns of the site as a scam. I&amp;amp;#39;m unsure if  I&amp;amp;#39;m allowed to post the name of the exchange site, a mod can tell me if its ok. I actually hadn&amp;amp;#39;t even used the site this year.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The scammers were patient. They waited until the wallet had more funds in it than it did when first connected. Around $1400 BUSD worth.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How did it happen?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I found the transaction on bscscan and traced the wallet address back to the exchange site. I remembered using it once last year, but not much more. So I decided to create another wallet and conducted some tiny transactions to try to figure out how the scam worked.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is what I believe happened.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The wallet was connected to the exchange like any other. The exchange was audited and seemed legit. I performed tiny transaction of some BUSD and the approval request from Metamask appeared. Looking carefully, I noticed that the approval button was designed to approve THREE (3) transactions. One was the transacrtion I had made, but one of the other transactions was &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;an authorisation for the exchange to withdraw up to $100000000 BUSD!&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What the hell? I never noticed a transaction like that before. I checked my main Metamask and found the same type of authorisation last year. Shit. Somehow hidden among normal transactions I had approved a request to allow this exchange to withdraw funds whenever they fucking wanted. All they had to do was watch my wallet transactions and determine a point when they thought I currently had a lot more money than usual stored.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How to prevent in the future?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Naturally, I was concerned that I had conducted similar type transaction approval requests in the past, so I started to research how to check who/what else has access to my wallet. I fortunately fopund nothing else of concern. But I wanted to share how to check it for yourselves.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Firstly, Make sure that existing connected sites are accurate.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anything   you don&amp;amp;#39;t use anymore, or worse, don&amp;amp;#39;t recognise should be immediately   removed. This is easy to do. Open your wallet, click the three dots  and  select &amp;amp;#39;connected sites&amp;amp;#39;, browse through the list and revoke  anything  that you don&amp;amp;#39;t want.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Secondly, revoke any tokens. This is likely something very few people do.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;And this is how I got scammed.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For Ethereum Mainnet/Binance Smart Chain, visit the site token checker on ethscan/bscscan. Enter your ETH/BSC wallet address and browse though the list. Revoke anything you no longer use.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;EDIT:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thank you to all the people who DMd and thanked me for alerting them to the issue of token approval. Some people said they found dozens of connected sites and tokens that they hadn&amp;amp;#39;t touched in a very long time. I&amp;amp;#39;m grateful some people found my experience beneficial.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The mod said it was ok to post a screenshot. See below. The issue that I was trying to raise was not so much the site itself, but the ability for most sites to connect your token with unlimited access.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Watch how the market will start getting littered with ads (even ones unrelated to crypto) once Meta starts monopolizing the crypto space.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I think the only way to avoid this would be through allowing publishers to motorize without ads through users’ processing power. Networks like Gather are already doing that so lets hope this swerves away companies like Facebook and Google.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
