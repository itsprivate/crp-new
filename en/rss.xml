Minting their “Otherdeeds” cost 305 APE and generated over $550 million in sales in the first day all on the hope that they’re going to do something interesting with virtual real estate. I don’t get why the vast majority of the hype is around virtual real estate NFTs when there are several projects already doing stuff with &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;real life&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; real estate via NFTs.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I learned about these Web3 real estate projects recently and they seem so much more tangible than most metaverse projects. It’s not like Web3 real estate projects are immune to issues. Balcony DAO, Propy, CitaDAO, etc. all have their issues and I’m not going to pretend like they don’t. DeFi is the future but there are a lot of kinks that will have to be worked out. But I continue to be surprised that so much hype and money goes towards virtual real estate on the expectation that &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;maybe someday&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; these virtual spaces will have enough users rather than going towards projects focused on real buildings that people really need to live in and can produce income from.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If anyone is curious, here’s some of the real estate NFT projects that seem most interesting (in alphabetical order):&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.balconydao.com/&quot;&amp;gt;Balcony DAO&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;: This is in the early stages but they’re one of the most interesting ones.  Their goal is to take major real estate investment opportunities (think residential skyscrapers) that are normally inaccessible to the average investor and turn them into investing opportunities for regular people via NFTs. They have a fully doxxed team with founders who are well known and respected in the real estate space.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://citadao.io/&quot;&amp;gt;CitaDAO&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;: They want real estate to be tokenized and transacted on chain. One of their focal points is steady rental income from their projects. They’re starting with property in England and their process involves staking USDC in a pool. Their initial fundraising effort failed to capture enough revenue, falling about 30% short of the total they needed, but still felt like a good proof of concept for the DAO. They still have future plans to pursue another IRO (Introducing Real Estate On-chain) round.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lofty.ai/&quot;&amp;gt;Lofty AI&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;: They’re a startup where you can buy shares in tokenized rental properties. Shares can go as low as $50 so the ceiling for involvement is very low. They’re similar to existing projects like Fundrise and Roofstock but they have a lower bar for entry.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://propy.com/&quot;&amp;gt;Propy&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;: Propy is maybe the most well known player in this space. Their focus is on normal real estate transactions in the Web3 world. Instead of buying or selling your house through normal means, you can trade it like an NFT. They claim to have sold the world’s first real estate NFT.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I can safely say that i am certainly sure I have addiction issues with crypto. As it is, quite literally like gambling.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I loved the highs, but frankly I have only begun to dig my own grave by the amount of lows I&amp;amp;#39;ve been through. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bad decision making, thinking &amp;amp;quot;yeah this&amp;amp;#39;ll work out&amp;amp;quot; and being a fucking gambling addicted idiot.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I have sold the last but of my crypto, and I am genuinely done. I&amp;amp;#39;ve gone through to many sleepless nights of uncertainty, too many days of overthinking. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I am out. Goodbye fellas.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;PS: Don&amp;amp;#39;t get into crypto if you have:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A) an addictive personality
B) have mental health issues
C) think it&amp;amp;#39;s smart to invest money you actually need&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;EVERY POST&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; involving crypto (in some cases not even involving it), especially posts by Elon Musk, there are these people spamming dumb shit about this doggy coin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Just take a look at his tweets history and you will understand what I&amp;amp;#39;m saying - and he is just one of them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m annoyed of Dogecoin because of these people. How can your life be resumed by &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;convincing people all the time&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; that there&amp;amp;#39;s a crypto out there that is worth paying for?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“Bitcoin’s volatility is compounded by its susceptibility to the whims of just a handful of influencers. Elon Musk’s tweets alone have led to Bitcoin value fluctuations as high as 8%.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Call BTC dangerously centralized —&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;The high concentration of Bitcoin ownership and mining exacerbates these volatility risks. One study estimates that just 10% of Bitcoin miners are responsible for processing 90% of Bitcoin transactions and that 1,000 individuals control 3 million Bitcoins – about 15% of the current Bitcoin supply.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All this was written as &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/22/05/27030896/sen-elizabeth-warren-questions-fidelity-on-crypto-401-k-product-what-you-need-to-know&quot;&amp;gt;part of a letter&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; by Warren (and senator Tina Smith) to Fidelity&amp;amp;#39;s CEO. The senators gave Fidelity until May 18 to answer questions regarding risks related to cryptocurrency and whether this offering posed a conflict of interest.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

There’s the fact that some cryptos have a limited supply just like Bitcoin. Other coins are untraceable like Monero and are great for privacy and DeFi is decentralized and safe from government interference.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But out of all features that will later prove crypto more superior than fiat, I think that low transfer fees is what will bring in new people initially and make crypto go mainstream.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The reason I’m saying this is cause I’m seeing it in my own eyes. I live in a country where a lot of young people live abroad and help their families out with extra cash end of month.
Western Union here is HELLA EXPENSIVE so I’m seeing a lot of people who have never had any encounter with crypto before open a wallet and start using platforms like Binance and E-Money cause of the ultra low fees and fast transfers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I’m not saying other features in crypto aren’t important. In fact I think limited supply and decentralization are much more important features. I’m just saying that low fees is what will most likely attract the largest number of people.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Essentially, this has allowed them to tank the price for a week and continue to throw tiny breadcrumbs in the hope most users will forgive them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I am particularly fascinated by the introduction to re-stake before June 1 and keep all existing offers - because to be honest, I think most people were counting down the days until the they were free from their stake - and the peak of investors wads about to expire over the next three weeks. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The problem with that, is most people are down so they will have to invest more to re-stake at the ongoing rate. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Source from Twitter quoted below for reference. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;We&amp;amp;#39;ve been engaging with the community all week about card rewards, and we&amp;amp;#39;re making a few more updates based on your feedback&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The process has been far from ideal, but it&amp;amp;#39;s important to take your feedback into account, and deliver an attractive yet balanced offering.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;✅ Ruby Steel cashback is increasing from .5% to 1%&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;✅ Jade &amp;amp;amp; Indigo cashback is increasing from 1.5% to 2%&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;✅ Current card rewards will be locked-in for six months if you re-stake before June 1, 2022&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;✅ We will waive the card upgrade fee ($50) until further notice&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Once again, thank you to everyone who provided feedback 🙏&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I asked for an official notice that all Russian citizens should be blocked, without the possibility of withdrawal.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I am a simple person, not connected in any way and not supporting the war in Ukraine. I created an account in 2019, verified it, confirmed the legal origin of the funds.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And now the exchange just wants to appropriate my money, referring to what is happening in Ukraine.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Why is no other exchange taking measures like yours?? Two weeks later, your support team cannot give me an answer, but is just playing for time. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;TICKET #BIT-1438832&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

It is losing approximately a million dollars each week it currently has less than $7m. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If the liquidity pool is no longer able to support the swapping of tokens between Safemoon and Binance coin, it will have to be disabled. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyone who still holds Safemoon at that point will no longer be able to sell it. Effectively rendering it worth nothing. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Holding at this point is literally the most risky strategy for you poor old Safemoon victims.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I would say this is not financial advice, but being invested in Safemoon means you probably won’t listen anyway. Good luck to you all.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Background: how high are those Fed rates eventually gonna go and how big is the effect?&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s important to keep things in perspective.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Lowering or increasing rates, doesn&amp;amp;#39;t necessarily mean we&amp;amp;#39;ll have very high or very low rates.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In fact, Fed rates are only going up from a near 0 floor. We&amp;amp;#39;re not jumping from high rates to higher rates.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The long term plan by the Fed is to target around 2 -2.5%.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is far from being high rates. These are still low rates designed more to stimulate an economy. With cost of borrowing still not very expensive.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In fact, 2% is simply going back to 2020 rates and the pre-covid normal.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;The key points of the JPOW&amp;amp;#39;s meeting:&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;-0.5 fed hikes as expected, following the roadmap to 2%.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;-75 basis points moved off the table. This lowers a lot of uncertainty.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;-Unemployment at one of the lowest in 50 years.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;-Wages moving up.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;-According to JPOW, inflation has likely peaked, and expects it to go down.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;-The economy is &amp;amp;quot;not vulnerable to a recession&amp;amp;quot; and &amp;amp;quot;the economy is doing fairly well&amp;amp;quot; according to JPOW.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;-JPOW&amp;amp;#39;s tone has changed since the last meeting. From a somber dovish tone, to a more hawkish and optimistic tone.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;What does it mean for Bitcoin and ultimately crypto?&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The US has the biggest share of the Bitcoin market, so while this may seem very US-centric, what happens in the US could affect the crypto market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Probably not as much as most people would expect.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While the correlation between Bitcoin and US stocks has increased since Covid, it has only increased from nearly 0 and weak correlation, to only a moderate and inconsistent correlation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The correlation works more strongly, when the crypto market is already more vulnerable to move in that direction.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Right now, crypto has been testing lows, and may have been forming a bottom.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If stocks do well and go up, it could help boost crypto in going in the path of least resistance, which right now is up.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There is one important effect that should still affect the crypto market: liquidity.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Even if whales trading bots don&amp;amp;#39;t care about the cost of a car loan increasing, they do care about liquidity coming into the market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Additional data about the current state of the US economy:&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;US real GDP growth has decreased at a rate of about 1.4% this quarter.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Unemployment is down to 3.8%.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Consumer expenditure has increased 2.7% despite inflation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Residential investment has gone up 2%.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The trade gap has increased to $110 Billion.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Covid cases have been steadily rising this year to about 30K per day for the US. They are still much lower than last summer, and compared to the major part of 2021.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Conclusion:&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The policy remains the same: kicking the can down the road.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Don&amp;amp;#39;t bet the farm on a great depression just yet. It&amp;amp;#39;s possible, but... realize that it&amp;amp;#39;s not the only scenario at play. We are still at a tipping point where it could go either way.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We are still in a potential scenario where this was just a correction. Likely more due to the extra liquidity turned off, and liquidity getting more back to normal, and the market having to re-adjust to reality with no more extra money printed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So it&amp;amp;#39;s not completely out of the question that the stock market could eventually resume its run, as businesses re-open, supply chains unclog, economic growth picks up again, inflation stabilizes, and maybe even the war in Ukraine ends or becomes less uncertain.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If markets pick up again, that will be very good for bringing back liquidity into crypto, along with confidence. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For now, the more short term result of this meeting on crypto, the odds favoring going for the path of least resistance to test $40K again.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
