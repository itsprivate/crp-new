But this past conference, it just really felt weak and ineffective.  Many of the guests really just wanted to talk about their company, or their book, or whatever project they were working on, and just kind of rambled on it.  Far too much talk about crypto in general, and not really much about Bitcoin itself.  Not a lot of macroeconomic analysis and commentary.  Even the star-studded panel with Serena Williams/Aaron Rodgers/Odell Beckham Jr. was pretty cringey and awkward for a lot of it.  Cynthia Lummis was really ramble-bamble-ish.  Even the panel with Adam Back got stuck in the weeds with no roadmap out.  And to top it all off, the Bull was missing his Balls.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Last year, the 2021 conference had the WTF Happened in 1971 guys, Lawrence Lepard and a bunch of just really good, articulate presentations about economics and Bitcoin itself.  This year it really kind of ran off track, IMO.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What did you guys think?  Is it just me or am I onto something.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is a visual orderbook and shows where resting (limit) orders are, the brighter the white the higher value the order is, the more blue to colour the lower the blue.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
As most of you will know most of the &amp;amp;#39;whales&amp;amp;#39; trade on bitfinex, and this specific pictures I&amp;amp;#39;ve sent are from the bitfinex orderbooks. The same whale who purchased over 1600 coins from the prices between 37.5k down to 34.5 has taken profit from 45k-48k and has now successfully rebought between 43.8k-40k. This type of orders are referred to as &amp;amp;#39;Iceberg orders&amp;amp;#39;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While this does not mean that the market is going to pump immediately because 1 big player is buying, I am just sharing this information as I know a lot of people on this sub always go on about &amp;amp;#39;whale manipulation&amp;amp;#39; so instead of speculating about what whales do using TA, here you can see what they&amp;amp;#39;re actually doing.   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

It&amp;amp;#39;s pretty annoying when you&amp;amp;#39;re trying to move a small amount of crypto and/or anything Ethereum-based from one exchange to another (CEX or DEX) and you&amp;amp;#39;re prompted to pay a fee that feels just ridiculous. 
My first suggestion to anyone trying to minimize the fees would be to check out the withdrawal/network fees for XLM (Stellar Lumens) on their exchange. 
While every exchange will be a bit different, here&amp;amp;#39;s how much it would cost for me to withdraw the Top 15 coins (incl. stablecoins, except for BUSD) from a CEX (KuCoin) right now:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;BTC: 0.0005 BTC (~$20.25)
ETH: 0.00625 ETH (~$18.98)
USDT: 35 USDT ($35)
BNB: 0.01 BNB (~$4.17)
USDC: 15 USDC ($15)
XRP: 0.25 XRP (~$0.20)
SOL: 0.01 SOL (~$1.01)
ADA: 1 ADA (~$0.95)
LUNA: 0.05 LUNA (~$4.02)
AVAX: 0.01 AVAX (~$0.77)
DOGE: 20 DOGE (~$2.94)
DOT: 0.1 DOT (~$1.83)
UST: 2 UST ($2)
SHIB: 1,100,000 SHIB (~$28.42)
WBTC: 0.0007 WBTC (~$28.35)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;XRP is the cheapest here at a pretty modest $0.20 withdrawl fee. Not too shabby.
Now, as someone who is also a fan of NANO, I had to check that one too:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;XNO (NANO): 0.02 XNO (~$0.04)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Okay, 4 pennies is pretty damn cheap so what&amp;amp;#39;s the big deal? Why XLM? Well...:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;XLM: 0.02 XLM (~$0.0041)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It costs &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;less than half of a single penny&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; to withdraw my XLM from KuCoin. To compare, I&amp;amp;#39;d pay over &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;10 times more money&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; to withdraw NANO instead. On top of that, XLM is a tradable currency at a &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;lot&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; more exchanges than NANO.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I tested this out by sending 10.5 XLM (~$2.10) from Coinbase Pro to Binance.US to KuCoin, then BACK to Coinbase Pro. All 3 CEX withdrawls cost me a grand total of 0.03 XLM (~$0.006), leaving me with 10.47 XLM (~$2.094). Still not even a &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;single penny&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; in fees.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Of course, trading fees exist and vary from exchange to exchange. Some have free currency conversion, some don&amp;amp;#39;t. So swapping from your preferred currency to XLM and back might cost a small amount of money, but it will still &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;very likely&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; be cheaper than withdrawing the original currency itself.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If any of you have a strategy like this that you use, or one that&amp;amp;#39;s even better, I&amp;amp;#39;d love to hear it! 
And of course, be sure to do your own research before trying this.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The reason is most centralised exchanges don’t allow you to withdraw XMR under fake technical reasons. Meanwhile, XMR deposits are always welcome and available.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Later, users of other cryptos recognised they can’t withdraw their funds due to fake power of liquidity. Although anonymous cryptos are affected first, some time other types of crypto were touched.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This insane situation is made possible because large centralised exchanges trend to have fake liquidity at all. That’s because their economical nature is to generate profit dependent on your buy/sell operations: no buy/sell leads to no profit. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And because crypto exchanges are not properly regulated as traditional asset exchanges, they practice to simply generate inexistent “paper” coins. You can easily trade these coins but if you try to withdraw them, you fail.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Most corrupt exchanges in that sense of “paper” coins are Binance, Huobi and Poloniex. Please don’t use that exchanges at all in the future and prepare to migrate from them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On April 18 2022, just try to withdraw all your crypto from all centralised exchanges and hence check whether exchanges of your choice do trade “paper” coins or not. If so, you can’t withdraw. Blacklist that exchanges and broadcast them to all your friends in all social media.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is extremely easy experiment, just perform your own test!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you ask where to migrate from Binance, Huobi and Poloniex, consider the following list:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Pipelining – or more precisely, diffusion pipelining – is an improvement to the consensus layer that facilitates faster block propagation. It enables even greater gains in headroom, which will enable further increases to Cardano’s performance and competitiveness.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Pipelining is just one of the pillars supporting Cardano’s scaling this year. Combined, all these changes will lead Cardano to a position where it is faster than its competitors, and a highly competitive platform for decentralized finance (DeFi) this year.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Expect June to be a month of innovation and change for the Cardano ecosystem.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/zwuk6drnz4t81.jpg?width=2212&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=6cc8ae8a4fcc3b092caacb0f0efad779a7611ec9&quot;&amp;gt;Which is down a whopping 84&amp;amp;#37; from its IPO&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The IPO which SEC&amp;amp;#39;s anti-poor hitman Gary Gensler approved... &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You see, as long as you lose money, its all fun and games. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But when the average guys finds a way to make just a little more than what the government allows them to make, they have to be shut down using the entire force of the regulatoooors who want to protect you from earning more than what banks allow you. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The 7% rate offered by Celsius or Blockfi isnt even inflation beating, in the era of &amp;amp;gt; 8% CPI. But you cant earn that unless you are accredited.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;What is, this WSB meets Monero?&amp;amp;quot; you might ask. Yes indeed, and here&amp;amp;#39;s why:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Monero&amp;amp;#39;s obfuscated ledger has enabled a number of  exchanges to misrepresent their reserves, and sell XMR that they don&amp;amp;#39;t actually have, knowing that all too many of us will never withdraw, and no one can see onchain the evidence of their misdeeds.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Well that all changes in 4 days. We&amp;amp;#39;re busy pulling liquidity off exchanges, to force the issue. Already a number of exchanges have frozen XMR withdraws.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Personally I&amp;amp;#39;ve got a little side pot ready to go on the 18th. When the tide goes out, we&amp;amp;#39;ll see which exchanges serve their customers, and which exchanges abuse their customers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;What would you do with €10,000 euros?&amp;amp;quot; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Of course there were the standard answers like buy a car, go on holiday etc. but in a class of 20 students aged 13-17 there were 3 who said they would buy cryptocurrency, with one naming bitcoin specifically. I was really surprised to see that so I asked them about it after class and I was shocked by their knowledge. I assumed they&amp;amp;#39;d all love SHIB or whatever coin Jake Paul is shilling now but they knew about shitcoins, staking and different exchanges. Obviously they&amp;amp;#39;re all too young to invest at the moment but they said they were always trying to convince their parents to do so on their behalf.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Long story short, it gave me a lot of faith that crypto knowledge and adoption among the younger generation is much higher than I previously thought.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bullish on Gen Z/Alpha/Whatever they&amp;amp;#39;re going by these days.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;People are already getting notices asking to explain their crypto activity, and being asked to submit all evidence including all your bank statements from several past years. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/40tai0pp29t81.jpg?width=960&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=ea198479789d684ebf52a576c01160286afb2877&quot;&amp;gt;Examples of notices&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The govt is asking you to explain all your crypto activities and track all your wallets. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These activities are an illegal exercise conducted by the government where the centralised exchanges are playing along, violating the right to privacy of citizens. The law protects people against unauthorised searches and seizures, without any warrant. Users of CEX are not performing any illegal activity, and there is no probable cause to effect seizure of everyone&amp;amp;#39;s data. Yet the CEX have happily turned over people&amp;amp;#39;s data to the government, who is now coming after crypto traders. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is possible that one or two users may engage in illegal activity, but that does not allow the government to seize everyone&amp;amp;#39;s data under suspicion. These are draconian violations of privacy.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

And that very understandable no human would like to see weeks of very red bleeding and every attempt of relief completly fail. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At such situations where everyone is just so sad that they can&amp;amp;#39;t even watch the charts anymore or even talk about Crypto. That&amp;amp;#39;s when you know we are truely in some bearish sentiment. But a bearish sentiment is probably the best thing, as the bears become very overconfident that everything is under control but in Crypto nothing every is in anyone&amp;amp;#39;s hands.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also looking at the history the past big bull runs started after everyone was not even thinking about a pump but just about a further dumb. One thing to akwys remember is that a bear run only happens when we can not imagine it going down any day soon and a bulk run happens when we can not imagine it going up any time soon.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
