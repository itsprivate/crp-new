&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sending crypto can be scary sometimes. That is why, usually, a lot of us send a test transaction first to make sure everything is okay before sending a full ammount.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now some pros lost that fear with time, but here you can see &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;one of the biggest crypto masterminds&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Vitalik Buterin sending test transaction before sending a full ammount of ETH, just like us!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Well, this transaction also shows how ETH is actually decentralized because we can see network founder is testing transactions because even he knows that he won&amp;amp;#39;t take it back if he messes it up.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

And not this isn&amp;amp;#39;t an exact science since factors can change the numbers a bit, and before digging into this I&amp;amp;#39;m figuring you would already have to have a ton of money where you aren&amp;amp;#39;t worried about this anyways.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Note when I say passive income to live off of, I don&amp;amp;#39;t mean high income as a laundromat chain (which btw from what I hear is one of the best methods at passive income in a normal way). IMO livable wage would be about $35k a year. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;HNT mining:&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;HNT mining is a bit different from normal mining, but IMO it might be one of the easier methods since you&amp;amp;#39;re just setting up a radio system and not dealing with GPU and other things. But at the same time, this might not be possible depending on your location and ability. Like lets say if I own a ton of rentals, I would look at this. Depending on the distance you could setup a number of HNT miners, and make money.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now lets look at the numbers. Again, this depends on your location, equipment, and so on. But what some are reporting is about 0.2 HNT (roughly $4 right now) per day per miner.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Each miner is about $500&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So 4*365=$1,460 per year per miner. $35k/$1,460=23.9 miners 24*500= &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$12,000&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Again, this means you need to find a place to put 24 miners, get it all working, and so on. Just the location will rule out many.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Something to note, IMO I don&amp;amp;#39;t think this is a good long term option. I think like normal GPU miners this will dramatically decrease amount earn over time, and many are waiting a solid year before getting their miners after ordering them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;GPU mining:&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Like before, this highly depends on a number of factors. And note the $ is going to focus on the GPU cost and not motherboard, electric, and other factors.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;First off you can go to the following to pull up whatever numbers &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://whattomine.com/&quot;&amp;gt;https://whattomine.com/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m going to be using a 3090 GPU as an example here and we will be looking at current ETH.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/t5pl0bq0dcn81.png?width=1824&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=5235c551540645854b34ca9c24030bec10f73b59&quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Per 3090 you&amp;amp;#39;re looking at roughly $4.61 per day.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Price per 3090 right now it looks like it averages around $2,300 per.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;$4.61*365=$1,682.65 per year. $35k/$1,682.65=20.8 GPU. 21*$2,300= &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$48,300&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Something to note is I think POW is going out the door slowly. There most likely will always be some coin like RVN that allows for this. But there is obviously a strong push for POS because of the green stuff.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Another thing to note is it is likely GPU prices will dramatically drop in a few years. The biggest chip manufacture is moving to USA AZ to get away from China due to political reasons. They mention something like 2024 or 2025 before getting everything fully running and setup. But they are moving a lot faster than expected. Still, I expect by 2025 we will see a massive drop in price in chip prices.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Staking and DeFi/yield farming:&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So it appears POS is where things are going. You can get different rates. Most aim for around 9% at max because keep in mind staking rewards are inflating (lowering the value of the coin) since it is making new coins like mining does.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To get a good overview you can go to &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stakingrewards.com/calculator/usdt/&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.stakingrewards.com/calculator/usdt/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Oh and note when the coin goes up in price this can make it where you need less staked. But because math and I don&amp;amp;#39;t have a working crystal ball. I am just assuming the price is stable from here on out.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So lets say 9% staking rewards per year.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;$35k/0.09= &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$388,888.89&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. Meaning you need to stake $389k worth of coins.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Defi &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stakingrewards.com/defi/&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.stakingrewards.com/defi/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Defi the % you need to aim for the most as possible since you&amp;amp;#39;re not creating new coins which means you&amp;amp;#39;re not lowering the value by doing it. But just do the math and you can quickly figure it out. But lets just say you need an easy quarter of a million dollars staking or more.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Reflections:&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So with reflections this is extremely hard to figure out since unlike the others this highly depends on others. How reflections work is when people buy, sell, or transfer the given coin. Part of the transfer fee goes to everyone. So this means when someone does anything with the coin, then you get a little. The amount you get depends on the transaction fee size, the amount of coins out there, and how many coins you hold. So it is impossible to figure out prior.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;BUT in my experience it looks like you get around 2% per year. Note things like Safemoon and other things are looking at having reasons for using the coin. Like attaching it with a debt card or whatever. And when that happens that should in theory massively increase that % per year. But for the here and now, I would expect something like 2% a year.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;$35k/0.02= &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$1,750,000&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;IMO this will be more worth while years down the road if a coin with this gets more of a use to use it, and you aren&amp;amp;#39;t depending on just trading.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Bots:&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is a side thing and just in my experience. I was getting 5% ROI with grid bots. Something like 3commas is about $600 a year. And note you will have a metric ton of transactions so you need to look into if you need an accountant and the tax tracking software like Koinly. Like when I say a metric ton of transactions, we are talking about 40k transactions per month or more. And the aim of gains per sell is 10 cents.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;IMO I think your goal on this should be more $50k+ in returns per year since you will be spending a chunk of that in keeping yourself safe with the IRS&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;$50k/0.05= &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$1M&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So as you can tell, this is a rich person&amp;amp;#39;s game.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Anyways, the idea is not that hard, which is to look for price when the stable veers away from 1.00.  Also important to look for one with high enough liquidity.  I found this article here &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2020/08/12/first-mover-how-a-defi-trader-made-an-89-profit-in-minutes-slinging-stablecoins/&quot;&amp;gt;source&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; a very fascinating read - in summary this is what happen.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Basically someone started out with 45K USDC and then borrowed another 400K. Then setup a bot to look for temporary differences in UST from 1 dollar.  When the opportunity arose the trader then used Uniswap to exchange 450 USDC for 492 USDT, instantly netting 42 K.  When it it eventually dropped back to 1.00 which he/she then swapped back to USDC.  The total transaction fee was only 2K, netting 40K, not bad for a day of work.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This story was written up here. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2020/08/12/first-mover-how-a-defi-trader-made-an-89-profit-in-minutes-slinging-stablecoins/&quot;&amp;gt;source&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.  In the article they also showed the transaction details detailing exactly each of the transactions.  incidentally is another reason why blockchains are great because all records can be easily observed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Importantly this was completely legal and was not unethical&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; because the trader only took advantage  of the price difference which is similar to buying low at one place and selling it somewhere else for a higher price. Arbitrage is standard practice only in this instant its done with stable.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Dear EU parliament member, &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As counterintuitive as it might sound, proof of work network such as bitcoin is acting as a value generating load balancer in many countries, allowing renewable energy to be developed at a higher speed. As we need to become more independent from Russian gas, renewable incentives are ever more important.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To illustrate the above in a very simplified way, please consider this: Electricity usage of a country is not constant, we could build renewable generators for median usage and supplement with gas and oil at peak hours, or we could build for peak usage, and let excess energy at off peak hours goes into proof-of-work. This shorten the return on investment significantly and give us a way to build enough capacity for tomorrow.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Further data:
- Global gas flaring (thrown away energy) can power 5.5 time the Bitcoin network
- Renewable curtailment (thrown away potential energy at off peak hours) in China alone can run 80% of the Bitcoin network

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Please ask the ECON Committee to oppose Amendments ALT A and ALT G. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is important for the future of renewable, energy innovations and energy independence in Europe&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Kind regards&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Buying a lot of Cardano before the launch of smart contracts.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Trying to time the market to make profit from Doge/Shib by rumors&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thinking day trading is easy money lying on the floor.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Buying too many different coins instead of investing in a few good ones.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Panic selling/buying&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But I guess those can be summarized to our favorite buy high sell low and believing rumors/upcoming news.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yes, there are many other options for example buy Bitcoin, a property or YOLO all in shitcoin but given the overall uncertainty of world politics and high inflation, it could be a great way to live from your savings!?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I mean you could chose a few different platforms and stake a 100k on each platform just in case they go bust.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Given you can easily get 10-12% in returns, it would be a very attractive option. Or do I miss anything?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Let me explain:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There have been three different Bitcoin symbols in use since its inception. The original one was designed by Satoshi and looked &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/Bitcoin_old.png&quot;&amp;gt;like this&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; - a picture made out of a few pixels, depicting a gold coin with &amp;amp;quot;BC&amp;amp;quot; on it, looking really, really awful. I think it&amp;amp;#39;s pretty interesting that Satoshi himself designed the logo as a gold coin, as I&amp;amp;#39;ve seen many people complain over the years if the media illustrate stories about crypto with physical coins with crypto logos on them, because that&amp;amp;#39;s a wrong depiction. I always thought that was weird criticism - it&amp;amp;#39;s difficult to illustrate crypto stories, are they supposed to print a picture of code if they need a picture? - but it&amp;amp;#39;s interesting that Satoshi himself used a physical coin as a logo.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The second design was also by Satoshi and was presented on the Bitcointalk forum &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20130524055823/https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=64.0&quot;&amp;gt;on February 24, 2010&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; (archived version because the pictures don&amp;amp;#39;t work with the current one). It&amp;amp;#39;s closer to the current one, still a gold coin, but with the ₿ on it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The third and final design, the white ₿ on orange background, was presented about 8 months later, on &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20130525203057/https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1631.0;all&quot;&amp;gt;November 1, 2010&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; (again, archived version for the same reason as above) on Bitcointalk - by Bitboy. Okay, not &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;that&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; Bitboy, but a forum user with that name on Bitcointalk. Seemingly a pretty random user that only made a few posts on the forum. Crazy to think that the logo of a trillion-dollar-asset was not designed by a graphic designer but by a random guy on a forum. He said he was inspired by the Mastercard logo. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I think the current logo still looks quite good almost 12 years later, and I&amp;amp;#39;m glad we didn&amp;amp;#39;t stick with the Satoshi logos!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;i just wrote up an email in german and compiled a list of all german MEP Email adresses. If you cant be bothered to write something up yourself or to look for all the email addresses, please just copy and paste my email below and send it out to the adresses i provide at the bottom.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;Sehr geehrte/r Abgeordnete/r,die anstehende Abstimmung über den MiCA Regulierungsentwurf im ECON Committee beinhaltet seit kurzem Unterpunkte wie ALT A und ALT G, die ein weitreichendes Verbot für Kryptowährung basierend auf dem Konsensus ModellProof of Work zur Folge hätten. Dies würde die bei weitem bedeutensten und wichtigsten Kryptowährungen Bitcoin und Ethereum einschließen, die zusammen für den absolut überwiegenden Großteil der Innovationin diesem neuen Technologiesektor verantwortlich sind.&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;Dieses Verbot würde einschneidende Folgen haben:&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;Die Innovative und wachsende Branche für digitale Güter in Europa wird erheblichen Schaden nehmen und sich in Länder verschieben, in denen das notwendige Klima für technologische Innovation geschaffen wird.Die EU hat bereits verpasst auf die letzte technologische Revolution des Internets rechtzeitig aufzuspringen, als Resultat sind die USA absolut dominierend mit Unternehmen wie Google und Facebook. Bitte ersticken Sie jetzt nicht die Web 3.0 Branche im Keim indem Sie ein vorschnelles Verbot aussprechen.&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;Kryptowährungen wie Bitcoin und Ethereum können zwar verboten werden, dieses Verbot kann aber letztlich nie vollständig durchgesetzt werden da der Austausch dezentraler digitaler Güter nicht verhindert werden kann. Alles was dieses Verbot von Proof of Work erreicht, ist dass sich dieser Austausch außerhalb eines regulatorischen Rahmens entwickeln wird, was erheblichen negativen Einfluss auf den Komsumentenschutz hat.&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;Präsident Biden hat erst vor ein Paar Tagen mit seiner exectuive order zu Kryptowährungen gezeigt, dass die USA plant die führende Rolle in dieser neuen Technologiesparte zu übernehmen. Bitte lassen Sie die EU nicht Kapitulieren, bevor der Wettstreit überhaupt beginnt, indem Sie Proof of Work verbieten.&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;Zitat:“We must reinforce United States leadership in the global financial system and in technological and economic competitiveness, including through the responsible development of payment innovations and digital assets.  The United States has an interest in ensuring that it remains at the forefront of responsible development and design of digital assets and the technology that underpins new forms of payments and capital flows in the international financial system[.] Continued United States leadership in the global financial system will sustain United States financial power and promote United States economic interests.“&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;Deshalb bitte ich Sie eingehend, GEGEN das Proof of Work Verbot in MiCA zu stimmen, maßgeblich gegen die Punkte ALT A und ALT G.Ich vertraue darauf, dass Sie das richtige tun und diesen historischen Fehler verhindern.&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Stock market and Crypto saw massive sharp unexpected dips. All that happened for Crypto during a bear market period after the 2018 parabolic top. That was the time where BTC and Crypto were called &amp;amp;quot;officially death&amp;amp;quot; even by its own investors as this was very unexpected and many did not have any hope for a return.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here we are two years in the future. BTC recovered from a -80% down from its ATH and even after then made another +200%. All that from - 80% to +200% happened in about one year. And today just a year later those FOMO levels are the new Fear levels.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That up and downs are completely normal for Crypto. The ones who don&amp;amp;#39;t give up and stick to their strategy are those that will be rewarded. Even in the darkest of times we should know that everything is just transitory.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

It is also Non-fungable, meaning that it is not interchangeable with other NFTs, unlike Bitcoin or Monero, as 1 BTC will always be equal to 1 BTC, same with Monero.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And to people who will say that NFTs are nothing more than a bubble(or the entire crypto ecosystem for that matter), yes the current art market for NFTs are most likely a bubble and more than 90 percent of those &amp;amp;quot;projects&amp;amp;quot; will either crash or turn out to be scams. These things are not what I am interested in. I am interested in its practical applications.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now, onto the potential use cases for it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It can be used for:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;1 - Event ticketing, making counterfeiting tickets impossible, as when exactly each NFT was sold would be traceable in the blockchain, ensuring that only those that purchased it before a specific date could attend an event.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;2 - Real estate and cars. This would help in avoiding all the red tape of taxation, as when you purchase an NFT, it would automatically pay it&amp;amp;#39;s taxes to the authorities, ensuring that buying real estate would be as easy as buying the JPEG of a monkey.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;3 - Going into debt to fund a business in a decentralized way that also avoids major institutions like banks, as some actions that banks would take a fee off can be handled by the smart contract. For example, you create a collection of 10.000 NFTs, each selling from a price of 100. You ensure by the smart contract that it will buy back these NFTs exactly 1 year later for 107 dollars, if it has the capital. All this means that you took a loan with 7 percent interest rate not from a bank, but from the average individual who might have risked only 100 dollars.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;4 - Preventing naked short selling. Naked short selling occurs when a group of investors short stock that doesn&amp;amp;#39;t exist. This is suspected to have happened during the GME saga. Each and every single stock being traceable in the blockchain would ensure that no activities such as this can take place.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There are many other practical uses for NFTs that I can&amp;amp;#39;t think of right now, but I will post on reddit once I find out about them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I will have a look in the morning, as I will be going to sleep now.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I tried posting the exact same text on &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/unpopularopinion&quot;&amp;gt;r/unpopularopinion&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; before posting here, it got deleted from &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/unpopularopinion&quot;&amp;gt;r/unpopularopinion&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; because it had NFT in it. This just proves the point I am making in my post LOL.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

This would be disastrous for Europe and its residents. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you live in Europe, you can make a difference - contact your Member of European Parliament (MEP) and let them know that you oppose a Bitcoin ban in Europe&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Look up your MEP here : &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/home&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/home&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;E-mail, call or tweet your MEP and tell them: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“An outright ban of proof-of-work assets will cripple the EU market, encourage circumvention of law, worsen consumer protection, and push the industry outside the EU – all with no benefit to the environment! Please ask the ECON Committee to oppose Amendments ALT A and ALT G.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you have enough time, a call and personal rephrasing of the above is preferred.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thank you for your support of financial freedom&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
