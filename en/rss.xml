&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Inflation is running rampant, markets are collapsing, banks have super high interest rates, and in general, there seems to be a general distrust in the established authority, who time and time we have watched bail out the big guys and watched as they make promises only to come up with excuses and more funding of wars.   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Point is the loopring and gme has a major following, and are loyal to these projects, and what are these projects trying to do?   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Well, they are trying to get rid of the status quo, with banks and exchanges, and even though their base may not be the most mature group, they are willing to take that plunge and &amp;amp;#39;buy into&amp;amp;#39; what the ceo of GME is selling, and often times its that blind faith in something that can yield amazing results. There is a vision, there is a substantial user base of younger individuals poised to bring newer people into he fold. The infrastructure has been released and is getting immediate adoption. Regulation has been making its rounds through government. You can pay in crypto. The groundwork is set...  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So as the overall financial markets tumble and faith in their eco systems deteriorate, they are fertilizing the grounds of decentralized finance.  As people pull  their money of out of these institutions, fearful of collapse, it only makes sense that a new system will rise in it&amp;amp;#39;s place. All major corporations are going to be watching GME and see what they are able to do, and if it even remotely begins to succeed, I think we&amp;amp;#39;ll see a huge ramp of decentralized finance. It will no longer be speculative, it will live, in the wild as an example of the promise of crypto on the center stage.   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We could even be in a bear market, but if these funds that were reserved for banks start flowing into defi, simply for self custodial reasons, the market cap in crypto will balloon. We&amp;amp;#39;re talking about scale we&amp;amp;#39;ve been hypothesizing for years. Who knows, but this could be the catalyst we&amp;amp;#39;ve been waiting for.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

A huge number of such apps have just launched out of nowhere. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Stepn for their part helps further the scam by closely controlling how many invites can be sent out each day, thereby ensuring supply/demand and the ponzi scheme doesnt collapse overnight. However they can only do this for so long. New people buying shoes are paying for early entrants to exit. Some time ago, the cheapest shoe to enter was around $700. At the end of this scheme, many will lose their investments they have put into the scheme. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is just similar to bitconnect where new depositors withdrawals were limited (you could only withdraw after some time in the system). If you control the entry and exit parametric of a devious ponzi scheme, you can further the time till it all collapses. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/62oorpohod191.jpg?width=1086&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=332688a2f5787dd9649103154300f65f774c38c4&quot;&amp;gt;However, Solana&amp;amp;#39;s founder thinks this is a \&amp;amp;quot;paradigm shift\&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Based on these recommendation from &amp;amp;quot;public figures&amp;amp;quot;, people are putting money into this expecting profits. If everyone understands it&amp;amp;#39;s a ponzi and still decides to play the game, knowing the first one out win and the last one baghold to zero - thats fine given how devious this industry is. But to promote it as a &amp;amp;quot;paradigm shift&amp;amp;quot;.... bruh&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some seem to think its not a scam because &amp;amp;quot;the app makes me go an extra mile a day and I also made $100, I cant possibly be scam&amp;amp;quot;. - this is the same kind of thought process that led to $40 BN being wiped off the market just 2 weeks ago.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These are going to be some of the biggest NFT gaming experiences coming in the Future, I decided to give you a quick run down of what to expect. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Gods Unchained&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; - It is currently in Beta available to play on pc and mobile version is expected at some point but no official date has been given. (Trading card game)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://godsunchained.com/&quot;&amp;gt;https://godsunchained.com/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Guild Of Guardians&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; -  is a mobile RPG where players can turn their gaming passion into assets. It will be a multiplayer, fantasy, action RPG where players build their dream team of ‘Guardians’ and compete in a guild to earn epic, tradeable rewards.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Release was supposed to be early 2022 so I guess its running late but hopefully will be out soon, it looks like a decent game from the videos.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.guildofguardians.com/&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.guildofguardians.com/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Illuvian&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; - this one looks like a Pokemon style game where you battle with different creatures, Graphics don&amp;amp;#39;t look to bad on the videos. Currently accepting people to register and possibly become beta testers for the PC version (will also be available for Mac OS). I couldn&amp;amp;#39;t find an expected release date on this game.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Ember Sword&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; - Free-to-play MMORPG with a player driven economy. This is probably the one I&amp;amp;#39;m most excited about as it looks like it will be really fun to play if they get it right, check the website for screenshots. I believe they have sold out of the land they had on presale.  Looks like they are expecting a late 2022 release.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://embersword.com/&quot;&amp;gt;https://embersword.com/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Planet Quest&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; -  A cinematic gaming multiverse - I cant really tell what type of gaming experience this is going to be but it gives off Open world Role playing game vibes. looks really interesting and they are currently having a pre sale on planets which I assume will be an important part of the game play. Something tells me the soundtrack on this game is going to be really good.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://planetquest.io/&quot;&amp;gt;https://planetquest.io/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can also read up more on all of these games and other to come at &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://imxgrant.nft.gamestop.com/coming-soon&quot;&amp;gt;https://imxgrant.nft.gamestop.com/coming-soon&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So I&amp;amp;#39;m pretty excited that crypto games are starting to look better than the current offerings and hope some if not all of these deliver some decent gameplay.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

One of the many reasons people hate crypto is the community itself. 
I would rather spend one week watching &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/animemes&quot;&amp;gt;r/animemes&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; than spending one hour looking at crypto twitter. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And im not talking only about ape pfps being, well, ape pfps; im talking about the cringe of crypto &amp;amp;quot;influencers&amp;amp;quot; and meme pages that either post repetitive stuff like &amp;amp;quot;if you dont buy bitcoin now, you will regret it&amp;amp;quot; every 2 minutes and the absolute worst memes ever. Not to mention the comment sections with &amp;amp;quot;hodl hodl hodl 🚀&amp;amp;quot; and bots. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;90% of people are here because of the money, 9% of the people are here because of the memes and the remaining 1% isnt loud enough to make the community look more serious than it actually is. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is also an obstacle for the mass adoption of crypto.
Imagine nations depending on cryptos with communities like dogecoin&amp;amp;#39;s.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What do y&amp;amp;#39;all think? Am i making this a bigger deal than it actually is?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

It&amp;amp;#39;s now the eight red candle in a row for Bitcoin, something that never happened before. The last record was six red candles and that dates backt to even 2013. One thing is sure we are in a bear market and quite an extraordinary one for Bitcoin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The current macro-economic situation is very unusual. We are having a stake of issues that are all worrying and will probably just get worse, all that while the FED is being hawkish. Probably one of the worst macroeconomic situations for the stock markets in the last decades. Also all scenarios are just not looking to get better, as Covid, Ukraine-Russia, Supply chain issues.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We are clearly in a slow-bleed scenario. Quite unusualy for Crypto, as Crypto likes to get a sharp dump at once and then just go sideways or up. Right now on the weekly it&amp;amp;#39;s a slow bleed. But as always this too shall pass and there will be a lot of needed relief afterwards.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Just few hours ago, he has made startling revelations claiming he has been approached by whisttleblowers who are willing to go public on the entire chain of events. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In a series of tweets, he implicates DoKwon, Jump Capital, Kanav Kariya (president of Jump Capital), and SBF (founder of FTX) of shady insider deals that have resulted in the destruction of 40 BN worth assets. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

According to these allegations, TFL already had a bailout in May 2021.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In May 2021, there was a similar depeg scare but which was quickly brought back to peg. At that time Kwon and TFL claimed it showed the stablecoin algorithm functioned as expected. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In further allegations, he says that Serum project has had deals with Jump that took retail investors for a ride. Jump capital apparently manipulated people into billions dollar losses. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is literally insanity, its blowing my mind how people have forgotten that bitcoin was priced at 5000$ and have JUMPED ALL THE WAY TO 69,000$ throughout both 2020-2021, and are fucking COMPLAINING WHEN IT DROPS TO MATCH NOT X14 INCREASE FROM 2020 BUT X6.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I have been stacking sats for the past year and a half and just putting bits in when ever I can. If you can take anything away from this, it’s not about how fast you can make your money. It’s all about the journey of making money and averaging into the market is the easiest, safest way IMO! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In August of 2021, whitehat dev   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/0xfr_&quot;&amp;gt;@0xfr_ (Twitter)&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;contacted Do Kwon about a serious bug involving Anchor&amp;amp;#39;s possible liquidator issues. He was dismissed for &amp;amp;#39;raging&amp;amp;#39; and Do Kwon was &amp;amp;#39;pretty confident&amp;amp;#39; that it would work (you can already tell what&amp;amp;#39;s about to happen) &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In April this year, as per responsible disclosure,   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/skgBanga&quot;&amp;gt;@skgBanga&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;and   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/0xfr_&quot;&amp;gt;@0xfr_&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;emailed the Anchor team, describing three issues in detail (one of which could potentially cause hugely unfair liquidations due to a major bug in the liquidation queue). &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Anchor team never replied. Did they ignore the email? Did they just not bother checking their inbox? Either way, during last week&amp;amp;#39;s meltdown, Anchor accrued $20.8m in bad debt at a direct cost to depositors. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/throwaway0xfr/anchor-bad-debt&quot;&amp;gt;https://github.com/throwaway0xfr/anchor-bad-debt&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I remember seeing a lot of reports in the Anchor Discord of people being liquidated for their entire collateral instead of just what they owed. This bug explains it. Carelessness led to people&amp;amp;#39;s money being unfairly snatched away (again) &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the grand scheme of things, $20.8m is not that much (especially when UST was shedding billions from its market cap), but this event lends to a certain culture &amp;amp;amp; environment that seem to be present at TFL. Despite being paid millions, they seem to be flippant at times. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

He was the first to describe digital money and wrote his paper in 1983.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;quotes from the article:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In his paper, he describes the key point that his digital money differs from credit card payments through anonymity. Users receive the digital currency from their bank, but then it is made anonymous. This allows the bank to see who has exchanged how much money, but not what it is used for.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Chaum uses cryptography to create a blind, digital signature to make money anonymous. A metaphor best explains what this signature is&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;David Chaum then starts a company in 1989 and then creates a virtual currency call DigiCash.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It enables the secure and convenient payment of goods and services on the Internet. This distinguishes DigiCash from conventional credit cards, whose use is quite insecure in comparison&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What makes this even more intriguing is that apparently, Bill Gates at the time wanted to integrate DigiCash into Windows 95 but the deal fell short.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I find this both interesting and a bit conflicting considering Bill Gate&amp;amp;#39;s stance on cryptocurrency.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;edit: this is not poopoo on Gates because views can change. Personally I think he is one of the good guys even at one and still does support larger tax for billionaire and not the mention pumping billions into humanatarian work.   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While the dust is yet to settle from the collapse, it looks more and more like an inside job where a spectacular fraud scheme seems to have been played out by those closely associated with the project.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I have a question for all of you people: when was the last time you were hungry, and I mean really hungry?  When was the last time you were already late for rent and wondering what around your house you could sell to make up the difference?  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Make no mistake: I am a crypto maximalist.  One of the OGs.  But I also strive to be a realist.  And let me assure you: people who can’t afford basic necessities don’t have time for made up internet coins.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After being involved with crypto for many years I went through a rough patch in 2019 - 2020 where I was on food stamps and begging for rent money on social media.  I was selling my shit on eBay and relying on charity to make it from one month to the next.  I gotta say, I gave zero shits about what was going on in crypto land.  My vision was focused on just making it day to day.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And I think a lot of people are going to end up in that same mindset if a real recession hits us.  People aren’t gonna have extra money to buy &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;any&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; crypto, not monkey nfts, not dog coins, not Algorand, not Ether, not even fucking Bitcoin itself.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And I think you should mentally prepare for that.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It should be a possibility on your mental list that crypto might be about to experience it’s first &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;true&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; crash, and it will seem like an extinction level event.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;———  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;edit: the fact that this is getting almost unanimously downvoted tells me I’m probably right.  Y’all ride that hopium into the ground.  To make money in this game you need to do the &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;opposite&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; of what everyone believes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Even gold tanked and for six long months kept declining alongside stocks.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But then a decoupling happened, after the inital panic where everything got caught up in a global sell off gold reversed and proceeded to rally very strongly for the next 4 years while stocks kept falling. After the initial 6 months of confused panic people woke up and started searching for a safe haven.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Today we are already in a recession but people just dont realise it yet. Stocks have been falling since November last year, some individual stocks down 60%+, the nasdaq down 30% and the S&amp;amp;amp;P500 just today confirming a bear market by falling more than 20%. And just like 2008 gold has been selling off alongside stocks. This time however so too has bitcoin, which just like stocks has been falling since November last year.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;History is repeating.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Over the coming months all economic indicators are going to confirm that the world is in a global recession that started in November last year, and everyone will wake up. They will realise whats going on and start looking for a safe haven. Thats when gold and bitcoin will reverse and enter a strong bull market rally over the next few years while stocks keep falling and indexes languish down 70%+ from their November 2021 highs.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Gold may double or triple in price seeing its market cap rise from $10T to $20T or even $30T. But bitcoin is starting from a much lower $500B market cap and as banks start failing and inflation runs hotter than expected btc will race to equal golds market cap if not exceed it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At a bitcoin market cap of $30T one bitcoin will be worth $1.5 million dollars.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I expect to see gold and bitcoin both decouple from the declining stock market over the next couple of months as a recession is officially confirmed, both beginning a multi-year bull market rally that may last until 2025 taking gold to $5000 per ounce and bitcoin above $1 million.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
