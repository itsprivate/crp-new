&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m a guy and I&amp;amp;#39;ve been speaking with a girl from another country for about 3 months now. I would say its more than a friendship. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyway, very early on in our conversations she brought up crypto mining and said that I should do it, and she would show me how.
I did some research and thought there&amp;amp;#39;s no way I can crypto mine, 1: I&amp;amp;#39;m not clever enough and 2: I haven&amp;amp;#39;t even got a computer,  let alone super computer power. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;She then got me to download a digital wallet app and another app where I will transfer my crypto too. We are &amp;amp;#39;mining&amp;amp;#39; USTD, which is a stable coin. 
However,  I&amp;amp;#39;m sure it&amp;amp;#39;s not crypto mining, she&amp;amp;#39;s basically give me a hyperlink to use on the DApps (Decentralized apps) which takes me through to a mining pool where I can claim anywhere from 1-6% interest daily (depending on my wallet balance) &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So I started off putting 100 USDT to see if it would work,  and it sure did. I was receiving 1.5% everyday, but that&amp;amp;#39;s hardly nothing. After 3 weeks I put 1000 USDT in and was reaping a 3% interest everyday. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fast forward a couple months,  obviously I have been speaking to this girl everyday and the trust levels are building. Last week, I deposited another 8300 USDT to boost it to 10,000. That way i get 3.5% of that everyday. She tells me she has over 100,000 deposited which means she gets 4.5% daily,  she makes 4500 USDT in one day... &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;ve made 2,300 USTD in the last 6 days, since I increased my balance to 10,000. But it all seems way too good to be true?? Surely no one can make this much money a day, for literally doing nothing. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This girl I&amp;amp;#39;m speaking to now wants me to deposit even more to take advantage of even higher interest rates,  and it&amp;amp;#39;s making me suspicious. Could she literally take my money through the 3rd party DApp? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;ve already deposited money to my bank twice before and have been successful, so withdrawing the cash isn&amp;amp;#39;t an issue. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I done some research on &amp;amp;#39;Coin Staking&amp;amp;#39; and this sounds a lot similar to what I&amp;amp;#39;m actually doing.  With coin staking, your essentially donating your crypto assets to contribute to the blockchain, and you get rewarded each time a transaction gets validated. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m really hoping someone can help shed some light on what I&amp;amp;#39;m actually involved in. I&amp;amp;#39;m happy to answer any questions. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thanks so much!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I only have relevant holdings of four coins: BTC, ETH, another top coin that this sub likes a lot and one pretty small coin that also used to be popular around here, as my high-risk option. I don&amp;amp;#39;t mention the other two explicitly because this is not a shill post, the message is: I have a portfolio this sub would pretty much approve of, I don&amp;amp;#39;t have any meme coins or hyped moonshots, not even in my smaller, insignificant holdings.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That&amp;amp;#39;s because I don&amp;amp;#39;t really like meme coins. Don&amp;amp;#39;t really see the appeal, except from trying to get lucky and make money quick. But I dislike misinformation even more, and I see problems about that on this sub. If someone made a post right now where they said&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;ICP founder confirms: &amp;amp;quot;It was a planned rug pull from the beginning!&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;and completely made up a story, it would get hundreds, maybe thousands of upvotes. Maybe the mods would remove it at some point, maybe not. But people would eat it up. If I then came along and made another post that elaborately showed how that post just completely lied, it would get buried in downvotes and only a few people would read it. I could start with a disclaimer that I don&amp;amp;#39;t think ICP is a good project and that I don&amp;amp;#39;t hold any and never did, people would still call me an ICP shill that is bitter because he gambled on the wrong coin and is now trying to pump his bags.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How do I know that? &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Because it happened to me multiple times.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; I really dislike misinformation and the unfounded circle-jerk-hating that&amp;amp;#39;s going on here. So quite a few of the posts I make are just trying to correct false information that got really popular on here, I feel like half my posts start with &amp;amp;quot;No, &amp;amp;quot;. If this misinformation I am trying to correct is about the coins this sub hates, however, this usually doesn&amp;amp;#39;t go so well. Two examples:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A few months ago, I made a post saying that it was a bad argument to say Doge is dead just because it&amp;amp;#39;s down from ATH (back then, there were multiple very popular post saying just that), when almost everything was down from ATH. I did not say a positive word about Doge, just that &amp;amp;quot;being down from ATH&amp;amp;quot; is a bad argument, especially for a coin that has been surviving for 8 years. I was called a shill, people told me I fell for a get rich quick scheme (&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;remember, I never had any Doge and also said that in the post&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;) etc.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Similarly, today I made a post that &amp;amp;quot;ApeCoin fell 80% on its first day&amp;amp;quot; is just as misleading as &amp;amp;quot;ApeCoin increased 2,700% on its first day&amp;amp;quot; and pretty much just lying. In the post I said that I was not interested at all in the coin, that it might be a scam but is most likely just a pretty bad coin. But well, that specific popular &amp;amp;quot;criticism&amp;amp;quot; on here was not valid as everyone that didn&amp;amp;#39;t buy in the first two minutes after launch (i.e. some bots) currently made a profit. You guessed it: I&amp;amp;#39;m a shill, I&amp;amp;#39;m defending a scam, I fell for a scam (&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;remember: I did not&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It happened more often than this, usually in comments. And I am more annoyed about it than I should be. This mindset is just weird: &amp;amp;#39;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;I don&amp;amp;#39;t like this coin, so I will just upvote negative posts about it and don&amp;amp;#39;t care if they say the truth or not. If someone corrects these lies, they are shills&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#39;. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Why this friend-or-enemy mentality? Why can people in crypto not accept that maybe, while their favorite coins are &amp;amp;#39;good&amp;amp;#39; on average, they have flaws and pointing them out is not FUD or makes someone a hater? And that the coins they hate might be &amp;amp;#39;bad&amp;amp;#39; on average, but not everything about them is, and that correcting misinformation about them is not shilling?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;amp;quot;I think coin X is bad, but this one aspect about it is just not true&amp;amp;quot; would be an awful shill. Who would buy a coin because of that?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;tl;dr: shades of grey exist, not everything is black and white. If someone doesn&amp;amp;#39;t join in some circle-jerk-hating, that doesn&amp;amp;#39;t make them a shill. If someone thinks not everything about a coin is perfect, that doesn&amp;amp;#39;t make them a hater.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

According to the bill, exchanges, intermediaries etc should stop dealing with addresses originating from Russians. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;She is seeking to cut off every Russian from crypto even though they have nothing to do with Putin&amp;amp;#39;s war. What is worse is that even decentralised protocol devs could be held liable if somehow a Russian ends up using their protocol or tool. How does this make any sense? Protocol developers have no way of limiting who uses their software. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;FBI, White House, Treasury department have all said that crypto is not being used to evade sanctions in any serious sums worth paying attention to. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coincenter.org/new-crypto-sanctions-bill-targets-publishing-code-facilitating-transactions/&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.coincenter.org/new-crypto-sanctions-bill-targets-publishing-code-facilitating-transactions/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bill would place sweeping restrictions on persons who build, operate, and use cryptocurrency networks even if they have no knowledge or intent to help evade sanctions though the Administration’s own experts have repeatedly said cryptocurrency evasion is not serious&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Senator Warren and a raft of Democratic co-sponsors today introduced a bill titled the Digital Asset Sanctions Compliance Enhancement Act, which would place sweeping restrictions on the cryptocurrency ecosystem under the guise of bolstering sanctions against Russia for its unjustified invasion of Ukraine. She has done this despite the fact that there is no data suggesting that cryptocurrency has been used–or can meaningfully be used–by sanctioned parties to evade sanctions, and despite the fact that frontline officials from the White House, Treasury, and the Department of Justice have all stated that cryptocurrency is a poor tool for sanctions evasion and one that they have well under control.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For example, FBI Director Christopher Wray said last Thursday at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Russians’ ability to circumvent the sanctions with cryptocurrency is probably highly overestimated on the part of maybe them and others. We are, as a community and with our partners overseas, far more effective on that than I think sometimes they appreciate.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;White House has also said &amp;amp;quot;cryptocurrency is an ineffective primary tool for the state&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is well reported that the Russian state is planning or already using Chinese Yuan, Indian government&amp;amp;#39;s aide to evade sanctions, not crypto. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Why is she so unhinged against crypto? Someone must be funding her so much that she spends her entire time talking shit about crypto and brining about senseless regulations. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;She does not even understand crypto, yet comes up with senseless regulations that cannot be complied in good faith.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Shit&amp;amp;#39;s just kinda rough all around. I don&amp;amp;#39;t know if it&amp;amp;#39;s the economy as a whole but I feel like everyone I talk to has had financial problems lately, and we&amp;amp;#39;ve all been trying to save up just to pay the bills lately.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What do y&amp;amp;#39;all think? Might be confirmation bias, but I feel like there&amp;amp;#39;s a good correlation between the two.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The is huge as it signifies market sentiment has completely changed. The S&amp;amp;amp;P was up only 2.22% today on news of the fed hike, and since 4 is bigger than 2, I feel confident in saying we have officially decoupled from the stock market. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I know what you’re thinking- “4% in a day isn’t that big of a change.” And yes, I agree with you, but let’s imagine the market grows 4% everyday for the next year. Because crypto is a 24/7 market, we get 2 days over the stock market. 4% of compounding interest over 365 means $100 investment today could turn into $164,880,329 a year from today. Now that’s wife-changing money!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Why do I think this? Well, the fed stated will continue to increase rates over the next year. From that, I can deduce the market will increase at the same rate over the next year. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I can’t believe yesterday my wife was telling I was an idiot for losing half of our child’s college money on “magic internet money.” After I tell her that I’ve only lost 40% of the money, she’ll really be eating crow. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you’re like me, you’ll know the bull run is back on. Take out a second mortgage on your home. Get as many personal loans as you can. Max out your credit cards on crypto. Your future self will thank you. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Do not do any research. This is financial advice.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;According to data from CoinGecko, Bitcoin moved from $39K to $41K in around 2 hours on Wednesday, 16th March. However, it then dropped back down to $39K before climbing above $40K again.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitcoin has a 41% dominance of the cryptocurrency market, and as a result, its price movements almost always influence the broader market. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;SOL, ETH, and ADA spiked almost perfectly in line with BTC. All three altcoins saw an increase of around 5% before witnessing a similar decrease to BTC.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;BTC and the altcoins gave up some of their gains following the spike. However, they have all held a positive 24 hours trend with SOL moving up 5.2%, ETH 5.9%, and ADA is up 2.9%. Sou&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Nevermind educating people enough so that they know what voltage their electrical sockets give. Half of them haven&amp;amp;#39;t even figured that one out yet, but instead their minds were replaced with some commie&amp;amp;#39;s thoughts onto a quick draft wiki page while boomers with PDST get reminded of &amp;amp;quot;Prisoners Of War&amp;amp;quot; everytime they hear POW. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Proof of this was the realization that 5 years ago, less than a million people signed a stand to denuclearize the world.   That will give you a clear picture about everyone&amp;amp;#39;s wokeness as a whole, and they are STILL TALKING about crypto.  They actually make a point to stop crypto transactions with Russia more than preventing a Nuclear war.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
.
Holy shit.   Indonesia&amp;amp;#39;s religious sector just said Crypto was against their religious beliefs as the reason to stop it.  But God ..don&amp;amp;#39;t stop the internet.  Nothing wrong with yanking it to P0rn0 right?   But bad ol crypto currency.      People actually think God said Yes to Internet but No to crypto. Like he&amp;amp;#39;s some sort of disgruntled politician upset that is Banking Investments are stagnant. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What a load of shit.   No wonder why bible stories say God will come back to destroy the Earth. We are too stupid for him, I&amp;amp;#39;d be pissed too if I were him.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here’s everything that has happened so far.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;March 3rd 2022&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They begin by changing the safemoon domain to .com address.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They also release a new video &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3OJimdqDd0&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3OJimdqDd0&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; showing new logos, wallpapers and concept art they created. According to the video, &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;the shapes and colors capture and display the soul of Safemoon and the SafemoonArmy&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;. People are impressed, they believe they put a lot of effort to create these and it’s probably the first original thing they created.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A few hours later, some reddit users find the logos for sale online: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://chromasupply.com/collections/all/products/nexus-swirling-abstract-shapes&quot;&amp;gt;https://chromasupply.com/collections/all/products/nexus-swirling-abstract-shapes&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.istockphoto.com/photo/abstract-3d-rendering-of-a-twisted-shape-gm1091231170-292736186&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.istockphoto.com/photo/abstract-3d-rendering-of-a-twisted-shape-gm1091231170-292736186&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Seems like 90% of the logos were stock images and renders that were recolored. This is the Safemoon way.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;March 4th 2022&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They announce an agreement with Moonpay, the service they use to buy BNB to exchange for Safemoon for 0% fees on purchase starting from the 5th of March for 14 days.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;March 5th 2022&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;New Safemoon wallet update!!!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Many people still complain the built in calculator crashes the app.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;March 6th 2022&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They announce that safemoonswap will support cross chain swaps beginning March 23rd. We shall see how this goes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;March 7th 2022&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A new token listing, Reflex token. Another in a series of dodgy, cringe tokens that promise the world but deliver nothing. As I say in a past post, &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;every shitcoin in its death throes that wants a final pump before completely vanishing from existence goes to Safemoon and asks for a partnership.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; If you check all the tokens they have listed in the past month, you can see the classic pump and dump pattern. I am sure some people make a lot of money each time a new token is listed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: Every token that wants to get listed on Safemoonswap has to pay ~$100k to Safemoon. The token creators use the army to pump and dump and the Safemoon teams gets a nice bonus. Everyone wins. Except the army as always.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;March 8th 2022&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They announce that they are working on scripts to identify people who lost money migrating their tokens from v1 to v2 and refund them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For anyone who doesn’t know, Safemoon decided to migrate from v1 to v2 in order get listed on more exchanges as the main problem preventing them was that the price “had too many zeroes” as they said (bs). The 1000:1 migration was voluntary but then people started taking advantage of the price difference between v1 and v2 to make money.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In their infinite wisdom, the Safemoon team decided to implement a 100% tax on any v1 transactions and announce it only a couple hours before in order to force people to migrate. For weeks anyone who wasn’t actively following their twitter/discord/reddit lost all their money due to the tax. People got together, created a subreddit in order to discuss how to proceed and decided to do a lawsuit. If I remember correctly they gave them until the 9th of March to respond about what would happen to their lost money.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;March 9th 2022&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The brother of the CEO, Charles Karony announces that he leaves his position as Vice President of Safemoon in order to return to college and complete his degree.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That normally wouldn’t be a bad thing but if you look in the last year of Safemoon’s life, every single member who had any role in it has left and is currently living a life full of luxury and travels, something weird as some of them before were no name twitch streamers with 0 viewers and small unknown DJs. Something certainly smells here…&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;March 10th 2022&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Safemoon CEO John Karony wins Utah’s 2022 CEO of the year. Every single nominee in the list was also a sponsor of the awards.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;March 15th 2022&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;John Karony attend SXSW and gets interviewed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;March 16th 2022&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Huge whale sells adds a zero to the price. A giant red d**do on the charts screws up everyone. This is going well….&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A couple more things I saw today that have nothing to do with the birthday but everything with safemoon.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The treasury wallet of Safemoon, a wallet they use to fund their business expenses by siphoning a portion of the taxes after every transaction holds 31.099 billion safemoon worth almost 35 million dollars. The wallet is so big that it drains a big portion of the reflections meant to go to holders of the token. You can check it here &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://moonscan.net/sfm:bsc/0xdaa3b5ae0521264e55f45157eb6e158e1f3e5012&quot;&amp;gt;https://moonscan.net/sfm:bsc/0xdaa3b5ae0521264e55f45157eb6e158e1f3e5012&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The blockchain wizard Thomas “Papa” Smith that once said Ripple offered him $2 million dollars to work for them, a core member of the team that left a few months ago, now says that he was actually a contractor and we just assumed his role was to code. This guy is clearly high again.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/8nh0b4nbfsn81.jpg?width=640&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=b5f662093562b60bb8a876848decd2961ca02a45&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/8nh0b4nbfsn81.jpg?width=640&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=b5f662093562b60bb8a876848decd2961ca02a45&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/mcvshcocfsn81.jpg?width=749&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=80f8ec2084defd733e5c9805dbb7279a6dd16ee6&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/mcvshcocfsn81.jpg?width=749&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=80f8ec2084defd733e5c9805dbb7279a6dd16ee6&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A user on discord asks John Karony about the 2 blockchains he mentioned in a CNBC article. His response: “we built a blockchain or two to test things”. 20 days ago he mentioned that the actual coding hadn’t even started yet and that it is only 10% of the process, the other 90% is prep work. He clearly doesn’t know what he is doing.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Not only crime but people also worry about companies launching their own &amp;amp;quot;Amazon coin&amp;amp;quot; that you can only use on their platform.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You know what else is a shitty &amp;amp;#39;this company only&amp;amp;#39; method of payment? That&amp;amp;#39;s right, gift cards.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So why aren&amp;amp;#39;t governments trying to &amp;amp;quot;protect us&amp;amp;quot; from the evils of the Amazon $5 card? Why are they allowed to be sold everywhere? Surely they are the ultimate medium for cyber crime.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Oh because big companies pay the government a LOT of money and they want to sell their own consumer unethical &amp;amp;#39;not currency&amp;amp;#39; as crappy presents and reap in huge year on year gains!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There&amp;amp;#39;s no trust from me for new projects , and yes before you say it , I understand that I should be only using real platforms like solana prime to trade , and that if I had been doing that I wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t have ended here .
