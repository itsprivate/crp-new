&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It seems anyone who was in the crypto space saw the obvious Ponzi scheme of Terra Luna for what it was. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How could this information be beneficial? These people called out Terra Luna while it was still on its upward meteoric rise. Basically they didn’t buy the hype. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If they were smart enough to be skeptical then, and not just be skeptical but pinpoint the exact reason Terra Luna would self-destruct a few months into the future, it’s probably a good idea to follow them and see what they’re saying now. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Chances are they’ll be right again.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you go to their website you can see their current circulating supply with the same latency:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/1vtvjvqez2091.png?width=1298&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=390553ce99b2cdb44d12eb745cf9b3505c77c9aa&quot;&amp;gt;The last update date is not true - it&amp;amp;#39;s actually May 14 and the supply exactly the same as it was 3 days ago&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So they&amp;amp;#39;re not only not reporting the supply, but they&amp;amp;#39;re also lying about updating it. The only reason why would they do that is because their supply fell significantly in these 3 days and they don&amp;amp;#39;t want more people to follow. If they didn&amp;amp;#39;t hide the 8B that dropped during 5 days, how much are they hiding from these 3 days?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Tether is getting more and more shady with everyday. They will probably try to buy back some of the withdrawn Tether with their reserves, decreasing their actual reserves and shooting themselves in the foot further. Of course Tether collapsing is not a good thing, many people will lose their money and a crypto crash will follow. Under any circumstances, don&amp;amp;#39;t hold Tether.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/f7meeksnb2091.png?width=682&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=5b93be41969b21b9408ec9152e9404f7844607bb&quot;&amp;gt;Daily - Dec 15, 2018&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Surprisingly the comments don&amp;amp;#39;t look that different from what you see today, some saying it&amp;amp;#39;s going to fall some more, others saying this time it&amp;amp;#39;s different. The one thing that is clear, nobody knew that bitcoin would not reach $3.236.36 again, this was the best time to buy.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Are we at the bottom now?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I’m sure I could of timed it better. But my plan is to stake what’s available of these and cold storage the rest. The plan would be to revisit all these purchases between 2024-2026. If they’re still alive either hodl longer or take profits if they’ve made good gains. Some are good alts that I picked and some were just random purchases off Coinbase that I could get a lot of tokens/coins for a few dollars just for fun. I’ll break down my current portfolio below with the gamble portfolio as well.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How the $1000 was spent:
Avax 11%
Algo 9%
Polygon 9%
Enjin 9%
Cardano 9%
Gala 8%
Cosmos 7%
Chiliz 6%
Dot 5%
Tezos 5%
Doge 4%
Anchor 4%
Bat 2%
Fet 2%
Uni 1%
Lrc 1%
Spell 1%
Jasmy 1%
1inch 1%
Perp 1%
Wluna 1%
Loom 1%
Voyager 1%
Shping 1%&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Real portfolio:
BTC 52% ETH 32% Link 9% Sol 4% HNT 2% Amp 1% also have some random coinbase earn coins and like 120 CRO that was given. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Like I said my plan is to hodl and stake all these for the longterm hoping one of these random alts will pull the next Sol. Wanting that $1k spent to at least make itself back in the future (I know they could all go to $0). Let me know your thoughts on this strategy. I may add some more alts over time but in very small increments like $10-100 per purchase. Reason I picked most of these is cause of ease of purchase off CB I know of better alts on other exchanges didn’t want to go through hassle to buy them though. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Have you ever bought a random alt and forgot about it for years to come back and find it mooned?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I even bought a hardware wallet several years ago but was too nervous to actually transfer my coins to it. I figured a big company like Coinbase is probably better at security than I am, so what&amp;amp;#39;s the real risk? A post here last week was what finally pushed me over: pointing out that in bankruptcy, Coinbase could (and probably would) liquidate my coins to pay creditors. While I don&amp;amp;#39;t think it&amp;amp;#39;s likely that my Coinbase vault would get hacked, I do think there is a much bigger chance for Coinbase to do something dumb on the business side and go bankrupt during some particularly bad market volatility. So I bit the bullet and transferred my coins - other than the excruciating 30 seconds between initiating the send at waiting for it to show up on the other side it was very painless. TL;DR I finally pulled my coins off of Coinbase, and you should too&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This becomes even more suspicious as LFG and other operators are not releasing evidence of their transactions where they claim they sold coins to market makers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The initial research has been done by blockchain analysis software provider Elipsis, and shows the possible time of the trades and are documented here: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/elliptic/status/1525246959161905153&quot;&amp;gt;https://twitter.com/elliptic/status/1525246959161905153&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The LFG wallets were emptied on 9/10 May, as UST began to collapse - purportedly to to support the UST price&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However today, LFG revealed they sold their holdings as below:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/LFG_org/status/1526126708193054721&quot;&amp;gt;https://twitter.com/LFG_org/status/1526126708193054721&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Transferred 52,189 BTC to trade with a counterparty, net of an excess of 5,313 $BTC that they have returned, for an aggregate 1,515,689,462 UST&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This implies 52189 minus 5313 btc was sold for 1515689462 UST , i.e. the BTC price at the time of sale/loan was : $32334.01&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sold 33,206 BTC for an aggregate 1,164,018,521 UST&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/LFG_org/status/1526126713062576128&quot;&amp;gt;https://twitter.com/LFG_org/status/1526126713062576128&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This gives us a BTC price of $35054.46 per BTC at the time of this transaction!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;LFG apparently used the proceeds of the BTC sale to market buy UST on exchanges in an effort to support its peg. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you look at BTC charts, the price of BTC during 9th to 10th May was around $34200 to $29700 range. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This means those who were on the opposite side of LFG&amp;amp;#39;s BTC sale for UST buys (published by LFG themselves) seemed to have got a much higher conversion rate, than what the UST&amp;amp;#39;s crashing price reflected! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;According to the price of UST on Coinbase, we can see that on 9th, UST ranged from 99.6c to as low as 75c! And on 10th, UST opened at 93c and fell to as low as 62c! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Those who were on the other side of these initial trades were able to redeem their UST almost at a $1 peg, as LFG bought their coins. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Who were at the end of these trades, only LFG and other insiders seem to know. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This whole thing is murky af, and this kind of suspicions is enough to call for an audit of the entire transaction history by a reputed audit firm. Around $40 BN worth assets were burnt to the ground in this mess, it is not a small amount by any means. The Mcap destroyed in this is comparable to the mcap of Lehmann Brothers. Whats worse is that UST mcap was actually dollar denominated debt held by many retail users. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;LFG and all the operators/insiders involved should provide maximum transparency around these trades.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

This event caused a general cryptocurrency bloodbath as a reaction.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;A police report has been filed yesterday by a Singapore citizen. He claims that he knew of more than 1000 Singaporeans that invested in LUNA and UST. UST was sold as the stablecoin that will remain pegged to $1 but it dropped to $0.1 because the ponzi scam collapsed. LUNA became worthless overnight. A total of $32 Billion dollars is lost.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The remaining amounts to similar Market Makers and CEX associated entities &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Let us be clear Tether and by extension Deltec ( bank for Tether) and Ifinex&amp;amp;#39;s ( owners of Tether) customers arn&amp;amp;#39;t the average joe on the street. It&amp;amp;#39;s the CEX system! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Ifinex through their own exchange Bitfinex showed you could essentially pump liquidity into the market from thin air and benefit from the fees while inflating your valuation. By just &amp;amp;quot;lending&amp;amp;quot; out USDT to the CEX and leveraging to the  tits with the same USDT. Which based of the NY case documents was $600 million of the CEXs own money. They backed the USDT loan with the CEX&amp;amp;#39;s own funds! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So if we are talking about $8 billion being &amp;amp;quot;redeemed&amp;amp;quot; we have to assume it was one of these market makers and or CEXs. Which based on some loans that had USD intrest payments we can then get a clear picture of what&amp;amp;#39;s going on &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Tether gives a loan to a Market Maker of $2 billion USDT. The Market Maker pays the intrest on this loan in USD to DELTEC. This is the source of the 3 -5% cash deposits they hold. The Market Makers then transfer these &amp;amp;quot;loans&amp;amp;quot; to CEXs ( those $1 - $2 billion weekly FTX and Binance transfers we saw)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But you are probably asking where the $2 billion initially came from. Easy it is commercial paper and shares in the CEX that just got the Transfer. The CEX&amp;amp;#39;s value is inflated by the USDT injection that increases the value if its Balance sheet assets ( crypto/ shares) which means Tether has greater &amp;amp;quot;reserves&amp;amp;quot; so they can magically print more USDT &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So logically speaking due to the recent drop in prices and  based off Coinbase&amp;amp;#39;s valuation collapse. We can assume the Tether reserves are in the shit. So they can call in their loans. Which are paid in USDT not USD. Only intrest was in USD &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thus when they burn the loan there is no redemption! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There was never $8 billion&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Note: For legal reasons this is for purely educational purposes and if any  person privides proof of redemptions of the $8 billion. I will delete this post&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;· 39,914 $BNB&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;· 26,281,671 $USDT&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;· 1,691,261 $LUNA&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Consistent with its non-profit mission &amp;amp;amp; focus on the health of the Terra ecosystem, beginning on May 8, when the price of $UST began to drop substantially below one dollar, the Foundation began converting this reserve to $UST.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Foundation did so by directly executing on-chain swaps and transferring $BTC to a counterparty to enable them to enter trades with the Foundation in large size &amp;amp;amp; on short notice.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;LFG:
· Directly sold 26,281,671 $USDT &amp;amp;amp; 23,555,590 $USDC for an aggregate 50,200,071 $UST
· Transferred 52,189 $BTC to trade with a counterparty, net of an excess of 5,313 $BTC that they have returned, for an aggregate 1,515,689,462 $UST&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On May 10, when $UST had fallen to $0.75, pursuant to a Master Services Agreement dated January 10, 2022 through which TFL managed &amp;amp;amp; executed all finance, administrative &amp;amp;amp; operational functions &amp;amp;amp; support as requested, &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TFL, on behalf of the Foundation, executed the following exchange trades in a last ditch effort to defend the peg:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As of now, the Foundation’s remaining reserves consist of the following assets:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;· 313 $BTC&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;· 39,914 $BNB&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This sub has many posts of people saying goodbye recently and I think these events mark a possible bottom for the market in my opinion. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto fundamentals never changed, bitcoin is still scarce, ethereum is still the biggest smart contract platform,  and the other developments are also the same. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you are a Dev you will probably enjoy this time to build a project and have time to polish it and gather backers and a member base. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you are a normal investor then you aren&amp;amp;#39;t having a great time looking at the color red everyday.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Right now most of the retail beginners exited,

It’s frightening. A top 10 asset, stablecoin at that, has crumbled to zero. People have lost millions in this. Imagine going for a week-long vacation and you’ve come back, your life savings disappeared. I’m really sorry for anyone who’s lost money in this. The last safe haven in crypto, stablecoin, is just as much of a quicksand as the rest of crypto. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Having said that, what happened this week needed to happen. And needed to happen now. The Luna crash is still reverberating in the markets and people are still anxious to put money back into crypto. If a stablecoin could fail, what else would your average person put money into? It’s a scary thought. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But Luna had to crash. Because imagine, if Luna didn’t crash. It was already on a meteoric rise this year. And when the depressed crypto market came back alive, Luna would shoot back up to $100, if not go beyond that. Luna was supposed to be the future of crypto. One of the market leaders. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If Luna didn’t crash now, but instead crashed when it’s gotten as big as Ethereum, at $500 billion, with the fundamental design problems that it has, I don’t know what would happen to crypto. Imagine if Ethereum went to zero tonight. That could potentially kill crypto for a few years, if not set it back a decade in terms of mass adoption. If the crypto market leaders fail, the entire crypto space becomes tainted and shunned. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now that Luna has failed, other algo stablecoins can learn from these mistakes. Create a better project, addressing these fundamental design issues. These are the growing pains that the crypto market needs while it’s still very young. Because ten years from now, these mistakes won’t be as tolerated.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
