According to Katja Hessel, German Parliamentary State Secretary, crypto traders can get tax exemption benefits on the sale of digital currencies. Furthermore, if they have held onto their assets for one year or more, they will not have to pay taxes on the money they make from the crypto sales.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Federal Finance Ministry of Germany issued 24 pages of guidelines defining blockchain technology ideas like airdrops, staking, masternodes, mining, and tax charges against sales and purchases of cryptocurrencies. If someone doesn’t have to do anything to receive an airdrop, they won’t have to pay income tax on it. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Do you believe that this new rule will make life easier for a crypto investor?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That upward swing was never meant to last, and the deeper we go into the red the more desperate people become and those with weaker hands will inevitably sell while on the red and want to blame it on someone, anyone but themselves, and I guess a celebrity like Matt makes for a good scapegoat.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Which is a shame, because there&amp;amp;#39;s so many celebrities actually scamming people, yet Matt only did an ad for an actual exchange, but that&amp;amp;#39;s just how people are.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Remember, your investments are 100% your choice, and thus your fault. Both the red and the green.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As we all know, the crypto-space is flooded by spams, scams, shills, bots etc... and of course, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/CryptoCurrency&quot;&amp;gt;r/CryptoCurrency&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; is no exception.  While most users don&amp;amp;#39;t see this spam due to our bots removing it, this affects our governance token by lowering the ratio as well as the cap, governance is meant to be distributed proportionally to users that contributes to the subreddit, not to bots/shills/scammers. Moderators also have a really hard time catching these users since bots automatically remove their posts/comments.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Solution:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Removing &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;vaultless&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; users with less than 10 karma from the snapshot and distribution.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Pro/cons:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Pro: Higher ratio and karma cap for contributors and more governance available to vote &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Con: Less moons will be burned &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hey hey hey everybody my name is Do Kwon and I am coming from Korea and let me tell you guys that I am so excited, I am so happy, I am really so thrilled to be right now sharing this amazing, glorious, super, and exciting moment of my life with all of you guys, and let me tell you that we are really changing the world as we know it, the world is not anymore the way it used to be, mmm mmm, No! No! No! TERRACONNECT!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Wow! TERRACONNECT! We are coming and we are coming in waves! We are starting and we are watching go all over the world! We are pelting the entire world! Let me tell you guys that I started 137 days ago with only $25,610 and right now I am earning 20% guaranteed yield! Woah woah woah woah woah woah woah Whats up? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And let me tell you that I am actually earning around one hun- I mean $1,400 on an every day basis, seven days a week! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What? I am right now independently, financially independently. I am saying to so many people who say that this was going to be con artist game, that this was gonna be a scammer game, “Hey! You’re gonna lose all your money!” My wife still doesn’t believe in me! I’m telling him “Oh honey, this is real!” “Oh no no no no no, that’s a scam!” And I said “But wait I’m gonna go to the bank and I’m gonna get my UST and I’m actually gonna turn it into dollars, here there right on the table!” “No, that’s money you took from another account!” And I’ll say “What am I gonna do? Then I said to myself, “You know what? When I am starting to put $10,000 a day on her, right on her, you know on her table.” Then she’s gonna say “Woah!” Hahaha! Yo yo yo yo yo! “OK that’s real!” Hahahaha! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So guys, I’m gonna tell you something. Faith and believe is the one thing that we will need to be able to change the world, and right now I believe that in this room, we have the seed that’s gonna germinate and is going to explode into an amazing opportunity for us to change this entire world. I am so proud, I am so honored, I am so excited to be here right now and let me tell you something, that each and every one of you has the opportunity to become like those amazing people that we know here from Vietnam.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hey hey! My group from Vietnam! Making so much money that it could probably that could probably have a real hard time counting it! Ha ha ha ha ha ha! So guys, let me tell you, I love, TERRRRAACONNEEEECT!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Doing a rollback back to 3 or 4 days ago does not solve ANYTHING it just hurts even more. The legal implications of that would be gigantic, too.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I am actually debating, if I should by some coins just to have funny legal battle if they actually follow through with that.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Circulating supply of luna has sky rocketed today going from 345 million to 210 billion as of writing this and it doesn&amp;amp;#39;t seem to be slowing down at all. He talked a lot smack going into all of this so I truly wonder where his head is at right  now. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I also wonder if we will ever hear from him again. I personally hope that he pops up 3 months from now, pretends this never happened, then offers us a limited series NFT. I would also like to see him introduce a new stable coin called &amp;amp;quot;SafeLuna&amp;amp;quot;. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I don&amp;amp;#39;t know. I couldn&amp;amp;#39;t possibly imagine where his head is at right now. What do you guy&amp;amp;#39;s think?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

So the simple version is that when someone sells one UST for $0.40 then it creates another 400 LUNA if the price is at $0.001 per LUNA. And if the price is $0.0001 it will create another 4000 LUNA from that one UST.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So it might seem like a great deal and that you are buying the dip 99.99% down but the amount of coins is growing massively too. You can check their API here (link from coingecko)&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://fcd.terra.dev/v1/circulatingsupply/lunaCirculating&quot;&amp;gt;https://fcd.terra.dev/v1/circulatingsupply/lunaCirculating&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; supply is now over 150 billion according to their API. over 3* as many as XRP. This will go to SHIB levels as that previously $13 billion of UST unlocks itself.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyway just a word of caution not to buy the dip becuase it will continue to dilute massively. I already lost some money myself buying the dip until I released how the minting mechanism works. Sorry its like 2 days too late. But hopefully this saves someone from making the same mistake.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Of the $1.25 trillion market cap, Bitcoin dominance is at 44.8%, Ethereum is at 19.3%, and when you account for (still) functioning stablecoins (USDT, USDC, BUSD, DAI) that makes up another 12%. All together, those 3 things make up 76% of the entire crypto marketcap. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Of the remaining 24%, some of the coins that still manage to crack the top 30  include Doge, Shib, XRP, UST (lol), BCH, and ETC.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So what is the takeaway here? After all of this time, the vast majority of the value created in this space has flown into just 2 assets, and 99% of the rest are pretty much dogshit.   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;ve been in the markets since 2017, which hardly makes a hardened crypto alumni, yes somehow still seems to make me older than 95% of this sub, so here is a look back in time for those &amp;amp;quot;new&amp;amp;quot; here...   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is a look at the top 20 coins from the end of 2016, how many do you recognize?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/4w3vo80043z81.png?width=1476&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=720dcd81a56962c01f4a613db44fdeb60d2a7192&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/4w3vo80043z81.png?width=1476&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=720dcd81a56962c01f4a613db44fdeb60d2a7192&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And 2017...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/fmnxubpr33z81.png?width=1508&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=00b217504c9296f6b56c358ab297ed070b4dcace&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/fmnxubpr33z81.png?width=1508&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=00b217504c9296f6b56c358ab297ed070b4dcace&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;and 2018...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/wf3v1k4343z81.png?width=1470&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=0738038a8808ce7375195b0e941041f8d8ab7b62&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/wf3v1k4343z81.png?width=1470&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=0738038a8808ce7375195b0e941041f8d8ab7b62&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I hate when people make these things absurdly long without getting to the point...so here it is....the number of projects we&amp;amp;#39;ve seen come and go, projects that at one time were the darlings of this sub, is honestly laughable. Luna is one more casualty in a long, long list of examples. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The fact is that 99% of crypto investors that have made any sort of real and consistent money over the years have done so by regularly buying Bitcoin and Ethereum, as they can afford to, and then just holding. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is so fucking simple guys, and most of you know this to be true. But every damn year there are some new toys to lose your life savings with, and people fall for it hook, line, and sinker every time. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If the 200% CAGRs of BTC and ETH aren&amp;amp;#39;t good enough for you, and you need to dump everything you&amp;amp;#39;ve got into fucking Willy Wonka coin or something, then godspeed and good luck.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But for those that are here to invest towards a better financial future for yourself and your family, and have the patience and temperance to do it, the writing is clearly on the wall for all of you to read.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I’m not familiar with details of that yet, but read below for my initial post.&amp;lt;/del&amp;gt; The blockchain has resumed without staking&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit2: multiple sources are saying circulating supply is actually 33B+ a 10,000% increase from the prior amount of 343M since May 8th. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;——————&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;ve been following the state of Luna over the last week and have a number of posts on it - with my most recent one from yesterday - warning people not to buy the dip. I&amp;amp;#39;ve been trying to figure out what to expect next and if ever would be a good time to invest in Terra.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What do you need to know -&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;UST and Luna price are directly related - You can burn Luna and mint UST, or you can burn UST and mint Luna. On May 8th (not including any fees you could burn about 60 UST ($60) to get 1 Luna ($60) - when UST started depegging people became financially incentivized to burn UST and convert it to Luna - increasing the supply of Luna. Since demand isn&amp;amp;#39;t keeping up with the increased supply - the price of Luna is continuing to crash.  Currently with 1 UST worth $.55 and 1 Luna worth $.0058 (not including fees you can mint 330.57 Luna for $1 (true dollar) of UST.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Prior to the depeg there was a circulating supply of 18.6B UST. Currently there is a circulating supply of 11.9B UST. Meaning it only took 36% of the supply of UST to drop the price of Terra from $60 to .006. a 99.9999% drop. There is still 64% of the total UST that hasn&amp;amp;#39;t been removed/converted back to Luna. There is still a long.............. way Luna can fall.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Why would someone convert UST back to Luna? Because UST is worth $.55 and it can be converted to $1 of Terra. No guarantee it will be worth that though by the time you get/sell it (you could even lose money trying assuming the price of Terra continues to drop)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://messari.io/asset/terra/chart/sply-circ&quot;&amp;gt;circulating supply of Luna&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; is up  425% in the last three days and likely to increase further and significantly faster as the depeg remains off and money flows out of UST into Terra further exponentially increasing the supply and dropping the price of Terra.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A lot more Terra is being minted for every UST now than yesterday. Yesterday for every $1 (true Dollar) of UST you&amp;amp;#39;d about 1-2 Luna today that&amp;amp;#39;s 330 and it&amp;amp;#39;s going to continue to increase at a faster and faster rate as the price of Luna falls. This is the death spiral of Luna and why investors shouldn&amp;amp;#39;t think they&amp;amp;#39;re getting Luna for cheap.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;If the total marketcap of UST was lower maybe Luna could have survived this above $1 eventually people may have ran out of UST to burn for Luna and maybe you&amp;amp;#39;d be ok buying it in case it ever recovered (this is likely part of why the last two depegs didn&amp;amp;#39;t crush Luna - the marketcap of Luna was still relatively low enough to weather the influx of UST burns.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Speculation. What isn&amp;amp;#39;t clear is will people stop buying Luna. I mean if you get 10,000 Luna for $1 are some people going to buy it in case it ever &amp;amp;quot;recovers?&amp;amp;quot;. If so will the people buying be able to continue to support people in UST trying to get out of the asset, or will people stop buying UST as it adds another 10 decimal points (speculation) if so what happens to the money in UST - 11.9B stuck in UST became worthless if people aren&amp;amp;#39;t buying Luna? Eventually when this is all done with Luna have a future without UST?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;--------------&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;None of this speculation is entirely clear, but what is clear - is.. UST is suffocating Luna and it could potentially become worthless unless people continue to buy Luna despite the number of decimal points it&amp;amp;#39;s going to quickly start adding.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Last note UST has 11.9B stuck in and it&amp;amp;#39;s supported/can be exchanged for Luna which has a marketcap of roughly 16.6M-50M depending on the platform.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Final Final note - some of the numbers are not perfectly correlated in different sections because the price was fluctuating while I was writing this.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;---------------&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TLDR: Be prepared for Luna to drop alot farther $1 can now mint multiple hundreds of Luna and that will likely increase to thousands soon.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;so yeah we all know that UST has drastically de-pegged.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;most people here believe that Citadel and Gemini or whoever did a coordinated attack to lower its value because they had loans in it (basically shorting it). Not like anyone cares to provide any sort of evidence for that because &amp;amp;quot;trust me bro&amp;amp;quot; is more than sufficient for that.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;other people say that LUNA and its stablecoins were always a ponzi scheme or a rugpull or whichever other words the average redditor wrongly uses as a synonym for any sort of scam, fraud, flaw or loss of value to appear smarter than the Safemoon crowd.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;in reality LUNA and UST are just massive failures due to a pretty significant flaw in the way UST was supposed to keep its peg. thing is its not backed by real USD and its also not overcollateralized, like DAI for example.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;the way algorithmic stablecoins keep their value (or don&amp;amp;#39;t apparently) is that you can always burn them for $1 worth of LUNA. Not for any fixed amount of LUNA, but for whatever amount of LUNA currently has a value of $1.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;this does have the advantage that you don&amp;amp;#39;t rely on a centralized company or on people that take risky DeFi loans to mint the stablecoin. But this completely collapses if too many people cash out at once.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;See you only get 1 US dollar thru that algorithmic approach if you burn 1 UST for LUNA and then sell your LUNA. This is a problem because if LUNA is being sold it is losing value and if masses of people sell it at once it could lose its value faster than you can sell your $1 worth of LUNA for $1. And in that case UST is practically no longer backed by enough value.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Maybe there was an attack, maybe not. That a stablecoin loses its value at any exchange for a short period of time isn&amp;amp;#39;t a problem. That happens all the time, even if only rarely to more than one percent. But that the algorithm that gave UST its value is completely unable to let the UST holders cash out without eating each other alive always made it a ticking time bomb. There is no need for any sort of attack for UST to collapse, this was bound to happen at some point.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I have the majority of my portfolio in BTC and ETH with smaller positions in some alts, so around the end of October to the beginning of November my portfolio was up around 70%. At that time pretty much everything in my portfolio was up. Some assests were up 300%+, but I was part of the DCA and hold crowd, so I did just that.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I held all of my profits and didn&amp;amp;#39;t take any profits at all. Everyone was saying &amp;amp;quot;$100k BTC by the end of the year!&amp;amp;quot; and I fell for it. I thought the bullrun would continue, and decided to just keep holding. Then the bear market hit.... Everything was down more and more, but I was still in profit due to having an average BTC buyin price of $34,000 and the performance of alts like SOL, KCS and LUNA (😭) that I bought in at a good price for and were still up a lot from my buyin price. Then this crash happened. My 70% in profit portfolio just seven months ago is now 20% in the red. All those unrealized profits have been wiped out. It&amp;amp;#39;s all play money that I could afford to lose so it doesn&amp;amp;#39;t matter too much and won&amp;amp;#39;t affect my life at all, but it taught me a valuable lesson to take profits when you get them. Holding is fine and will probably still work out, but I could have had a lot more money to invest now if I had taken those profits.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;TL;DR:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Don&amp;amp;#39;t sit on profits too long. Take profits when you can, because they could disappear at any moment.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Dip is 10-20% down. Don&amp;amp;#39;t buy it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When it happens, Redditors will jump on you screaming &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;BUY THE DIP&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; directly to your ear. Don&amp;amp;#39;t buy it. You&amp;amp;#39;re calm, your mind is clear, you aren&amp;amp;#39;t fueled by emotions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Soon it will dip 20-30%. You will notice frequent memes like&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What I thought was the dip. The dip. The actual dip. The actual dips dip.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Logically, you still don&amp;amp;#39;t take the bait. You play the waiting game. You are in charge here.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Next leg is minus 30-40%. Some people are borrowing money to buy here, since they spent all of their money on previous dips. Some people start questioning is this just a correction or bearmarket. You will notice posts like&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When Bitcoin was 60k you wished you bought it at 40k. Now it&amp;amp;#39;s below 40k buy now as you promissed!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You just smirk reading this post, take a sip of your tea, scroll down, turn on radio or something.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Next leg is minus 40-60% from ATH. Alts are massacred. You will notice that no one will even mention buying the dip, even as a joke. Even people who bought the dips are now down so much, that their stress is somehow even as the literal top buyers. People are now posting predictions of low will it go.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At this point, you start stretching. Counting your money. Calculating how much can you afford to spend on crypto. Getting prepared for the last stage.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;60-80% correction, bearmarket acceptance and capitulation phase&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Suicide hotline number is posted, and pinned by moderators. Divorce rates increase. People are selling for a loss, because they are emotionally damaged and don&amp;amp;#39;t want to play this game anymore. Others are just deleting apps related to crypto on their phones. Moonboys are out. Newbies are out. Sub is pretty much dead, low number of comments and posts. There isn&amp;amp;#39;t hope on a horizon.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is where you start buying. You also accumulate every now or then when you can afford. You do this for next two years or whenever next rally starts. Here&amp;amp;#39;s how to recognize when to exit, also know as top signals:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I don&amp;amp;#39;t wanna hear about buy the dip. Did that the last 18 times. That was how I got into this mess. ADA at $1 seemed like a safe move. Link at $10 seemed like it was a fire sale. Now it&amp;amp;#39;s all dead. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Neutrino USD is crashed to 0,77 USD that is nealy a 20% crash on this stable coin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Neutrino is an algorithmic price-stable assetization protocol acting as an accessible DeFi toolkit. It enables the creation of stablecoins pegged to specific real-world assets, such as national currencies or commodities. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This coin &amp;amp;quot;only&amp;amp;quot; have a market cap of  &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$721,922,721 and is not listet on major exchanges.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I dont think it will have much impact but its important to say that stable coins not stable at all.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;People are understandably upset, posts here are now emotionally charged. However the writing was on the wall as highlighted in my previous post&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ubg9me/despite_what_people_say_on_this_sub_expect_crypto/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;amp;amp;utm_source=share&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ubg9me/despite_what_people_say_on_this_sub_expect_crypto/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;amp;amp;utm_source=share&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I don&amp;amp;#39;t intend this to be a told you so post, I want to simply urge people to be cautious and think twice before overinvesting.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is NOT a dip, this is likely the start of a drawn out bear market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Inflation and rates are still on the rise, there are no immediate fixes for the supply issue, covid is still running rampant and the risk of war escalating grows by the day.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Luna debacle broke alot of trust in stablecoins and crypto generally. People are all of a sudden realising these so called guaranteed stable coin returns were actually unrealistic and made of unicorn dust. Alot of people are taking a step back and thinking, are the returns on my staking realistic? Could I be like the Luna holders and not be able to take funds out in the event of a crash? Where are the returns coming from?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All valid risks, people are much cautious. The authorities will regulate this space as a result. They have their catalyst. They could force other stables like tether to reveal their assets and they too could be made of unicorn dust.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My message is this. The risks are still very grave here and if your not prepared to whether the storm think seriously about investing and never invest more than you can afford to lose.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I am still bullish long term. I will be patiently DCAing awaiting the next run. We will all be ok, just be sure you understand now is an extremely risky time to be investing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

And I wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t be surprised if BTC, ETH and the other bigger cryptos lose 80% of their current value because these are investment (or gambling) vehicles unlike any other and we&amp;amp;#39;re in uncharted territory here.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
