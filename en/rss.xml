Basically&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;if someone is born today, we know they are most likely going to live until 80-90 years old.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;We know people are going to want to retire somewhere around 70 because that is the lie that was sold.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;We know health cost sky rocket the older someone gets on average.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;We know the first 20 years of someone&amp;amp;#39;s life they aren&amp;amp;#39;t spending any money or very minimum amount.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;We know between 20-40 years old the person tends to spend money on normal things like beds, kitchen stuff, etc.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;When the person gets in the later years they spend less to $0 on those things because they already have it. And the money moves into big ticket items like that car they always wanted, that trip they always wanted, etc but it tends to be 1 time thing. But outside of that the spending dramatically drops. This is caused by they already have most of what they want + their income dramatically drops. But again the biggest cost is things like healthcare (USA)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/cif5i6pyvbs81.png?width=905&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=c13412273a562b1ba44385f1cdc8fc22658155b7&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/cif5i6pyvbs81.png?width=905&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=c13412273a562b1ba44385f1cdc8fc22658155b7&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Above is a chart from Real Vision, it shows the estimated retirement rate of people in the future. Note this was 2018 when that was made, and I can&amp;amp;#39;t find a more up to date chart.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now if you take a look at the inflation vs recession&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/5pg1xqpzvbs81.png?width=1679&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=0ca4c8a4fd7fe828a679ae281a6749934e8305f2&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/5pg1xqpzvbs81.png?width=1679&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=0ca4c8a4fd7fe828a679ae281a6749934e8305f2&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We just crossed this and it bounced back, so we will see what will happen in the future. But in the past one of the big hits is 2008 time housing bubble collapse.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;See the thing is when someone gets closer to retirement normally they will move their investments into a more stable and less risky market. In reality, 2008 wiped out many people&amp;amp;#39;s retirement and many people are still not recovered from what they lost in 2008. This forced people to put their money in higher risky markets (which might include crypto).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Part of this or a lot of this caused things like&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/vcwe21n0wbs81.png?width=1477&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=976da11327998496d649b272aaed03d7aba3a437&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/vcwe21n0wbs81.png?width=1477&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=976da11327998496d649b272aaed03d7aba3a437&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;and what we might of seen in crypto. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Note the dates when the spike happened. Basically, people DCA into markets through their retirement system or for retirement.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What you need to keep in mind is what happens when people retire.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;They stop putting money into their retirement. Most retirement plans will not let you put more money into it after you retired. And even if it allowed it, most never had the know how in doing things, or they just don&amp;amp;#39;t care. But at the end, the DCA into the market stops. So the growth stops.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;They start pulling out, this causes a pull back on the market. Obviously a few doesn&amp;amp;#39;t matter. But as you see from the first chart, the growing number of millions all at once is happening.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So if you have a ton of people stop being buyers, and now becoming sellers. We now have a recipe for a near free falling market. What you most likely going to see is those near retirement or at retirement just retire and pull out as much as they can to save everything. Some (and this is happening today) selling their pensions or pulling out of their IRA early. And what happens is the first people who retire get the most, while everyone else gets screwed in a runaway market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A lot of economist are saying that this next recession is going to be far worse than the great depression era, and it is likely to happen in the next few years. (None of this is financial advice btw)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So what happens is&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/zmneemi1wbs81.png?width=3131&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=b8732310a65fc7638514be7f4725d547b051bcfe&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/zmneemi1wbs81.png?width=3131&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=b8732310a65fc7638514be7f4725d547b051bcfe&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/m8nrasd7wbs81.png?width=3131&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=79f0ee4908c47944bd6a9122514bb561377770df&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/m8nrasd7wbs81.png?width=3131&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=79f0ee4908c47944bd6a9122514bb561377770df&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You have older and older groups going back to work because&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;They are living way longer than they thought and the biggest cost in your life is just living.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;They lost too much in prior bad times&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Inflation cost increase&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Increasing healthcare cost&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;And in the future for my generation it will be student loans&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And as you can see, the older workers are now competing with some of the youngest now. Likely it is people who had good jobs ($50k-$100k+) jobs and due to age discrimination they can&amp;amp;#39;t do those jobs anymore. Now they are stuck with starter jobs and min wage. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/teresaghilarducci/2021/12/17/too-many-older-workers-are-stuck-in-low-wage-jobs/?sh=1d1ce8916c15&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/teresaghilarducci/2021/12/17/too-many-older-workers-are-stuck-in-low-wage-jobs/?sh=1d1ce8916c15&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some might say, well younger people will pick up the slack. Well....&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/yrankj98wbs81.png?width=648&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=50ddadb463b6b04fe1ef228f27197ab0e6645ce5&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/yrankj98wbs81.png?width=648&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=50ddadb463b6b04fe1ef228f27197ab0e6645ce5&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So thanks due to bad gov policies and society pushing a bad idea (by force where if you don&amp;amp;#39;t jump then you don&amp;amp;#39;t get to a better life), younger people are stuck with a heavy bill in student loans, increase cost of living, increase taxes and types of taxes&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/n02qd7y8wbs81.png?width=792&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=cdb226bb88bac972e8f902495b4f1f34cfc03002&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/n02qd7y8wbs81.png?width=792&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=cdb226bb88bac972e8f902495b4f1f34cfc03002&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;and a number of things which makes it impossible for the younger generations to support the older.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And then following generations it will be worse since the current generations are having WAY less kids&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/mvye8is9wbs81.png?width=1171&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=4b94b851b7f9304c2ee04b229d3e2409878599a5&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/mvye8is9wbs81.png?width=1171&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=4b94b851b7f9304c2ee04b229d3e2409878599a5&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Oh and top that automation is taken off so current generation and upcoming is screwed there too&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/36op4vjawbs81.png?width=1200&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e1c745c1c28913e6361c464c9106a01665809191&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/36op4vjawbs81.png?width=1200&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e1c745c1c28913e6361c464c9106a01665809191&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;TLDR What does all of this mean?&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In a nut shell it looks like the older generations are about to or are retiring. Since they aren&amp;amp;#39;t adding anything more into the markets, but now selling. This has a &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;strong&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; likely to cause major drops. Because of past economic problems and other things, older generations had to invest into higher risk to high risk things which might include crypto (which means when the retirement really kicks up we might see a pretty big hit). The ones who couldn&amp;amp;#39;t retire or waited get screwed and now they basically can&amp;amp;#39;t retire until they die. But thanks to age discrimination and not being prepared for such factors, the older generations are going to be (and as charts show are) competing with the youngest of the labor force. The increase cost of living and the fact the youngest generations have a growing harder time in getting a time getting a job. And then because automation is lower the workforce in itself by a good amount. It is likely all groups will start pulling out of their investments early to support themselves and those around them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;(Side note: today in a hardware store I overheard a few people talking to each other how they had to sell their pension to help pay for medical bills and other things, and how their retirement is a shotgun or being worked to death.)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The take away from this isn&amp;amp;#39;t a buy or sell. It is we should watch what happens and adapt. There is no data showing how this will play out since in no time in world history has all these factors happened, the gov screwed up so bad and it is still around, and with modern tech it makes it impossible to do illegal stuff to just get by.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What is your thoughts on all of this?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I did a search on the sub, and apparently literally &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;nobody&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; actually read the User Agreement. Posts of people liking the false sense of security of a non-existant &amp;amp;quot;account protection&amp;amp;quot; policy up to 1 million dollars, no trading fees, etc. We&amp;amp;#39;ll get into all that, don&amp;amp;#39;t worry.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;ll be breaking down the three main points they&amp;amp;#39;re selling with this subscription in their advertisement of this &amp;amp;quot;service&amp;amp;quot;, in the order they are being presented, while quoting relevant terms directly from: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coinbase.com/legal/user_agreement/united_states/&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.coinbase.com/legal/user_agreement/united_states/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;1) Zero trading fees - Unlock your portfolio’s potential and trade as much and as often as you want with $0 in trading fees.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Nobody likes fees. What&amp;amp;#39;s the fine print say?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Section 5: Coinbase One&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;1. Coinbase One Subcription.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Eligible Users may sign up for Coinbase One which is an automatically renewing subscription requiring recurring payments.  A Coinbase One subscription grants you the benefits of: (a) a waiver of Coinbase fees for buying, selling, and converting digital currencies on the Coinbase platform (which does not include Coinbase Pro’s order matching platform), provided that a spread in the price is still included in all buys, sells, and conversion of digital currencies on the Coinbase trading platform ...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You read that right? Market buys on Coinbase only. No Coinbase Pro. Market buys only on regular Coinbase. That spread might as well be considered a fee. Things get uglier, just wait.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;2) $1M account protection - Members may be eligible to receive reimbursement for up to $1M in losses caused by unauthorized access.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is the deceit that I felt needed brought  to the forefront the most, as soon as possible. $1M in account protection could sound nice, especially these days with all the phishing, viruses, keyloggers, you name it flying around. Let&amp;amp;#39;s have a closer look at those terms.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Section 5: Coinbase One&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;... and (c) Coinbase Account Protection as detailed in paragraph 3 below. Coinbase may modify or suspend this program at any time upon notice.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Well that&amp;amp;#39;s not a great start, but let&amp;amp;#39;s keep digging.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Section 3: Coinbase Account Protection&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Coinbase Account Protection.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; With an active Coinbase One subscription, you may be eligible to receive a one-time reimbursement for up to $1,000,000 (U.S. Dollars) of actual losses (or the U.S. Dollar equivalent thereof, in the case such losses were in the form of Digital Currency) that you sustain due to a compromise of your Coinbase Account login credentials resulting from a vulnerability or other deficiency in Coinbase’s systems and/or security protocols (the “Coinbase Account Protection”). The Coinbase Account Protection is subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this [Paragraph 3] (the “Coinbase Account Protection Warranty Terms”), which apply in addition to the terms of the Agreement and any other terms and policies set forth on the Coinbase Site.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;3.1.4.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; 2-factor authentication with either an authenticator application (e.g., Duo or Google Authenticator), security key (e.g., Yubikey) or push notification through the Coinbase mobile application must have been enabled on your Coinbase Account at the time you sustained the Reimbursable Losses. 2-factor authentication via SMS is not sufficient to be eligible for coverage under the Coinbase Account Protection.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That seems reasonable, SMS protection is very weak compared to TOTP MFA, a security key, or a security app&amp;amp;#39;s push notifications.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But now let&amp;amp;#39;s get into the ugly and why this account protection isn&amp;amp;#39;t really any protection at all.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;3.2. What is Not Covered.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;3.2.1&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. The Coinbase Account Protection does not cover reimbursement for any loss of funds held outside of your Coinbase Account, including without limitation in Coinbase Custody, Coinbase Wallet, or non-custodial wallets connected to Coinbase Commerce.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;3.2.4.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; The Coinbase Account Protection does not cover reimbursement for any losses that were the result of a security vulnerability or other technical deficiency in your computer, mobile device or security key.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;3.2.5.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; The Coinbase Account Protection does not cover reimbursement for any losses that were the result of an event or action that you were aware could result in compromise of your account security, if you failed to promptly notify Coinbase of such occurrence in accordance with Section 6.2 (Security Breach) of the Agreement.  Examples of such occurrences include, without limitation, if you lose your security key or API key, if you grant a third party remote access to your account, or if you provide your Coinbase Account login credentials and/or 2-factor authentication codes to a third party.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;3.4. Other Terms.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;  In the event of a conflict between these Coinbase Account Protection Warranty Terms and anything else in the Agreement, these Coinbase Account Protection Warranty Terms will govern.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, you are still primarily responsible for ensuring the security of your Coinbase Account, and if you suspect that you have been the victim of a Security Breach, you must notify Coinbase Support as soon as possible in accordance with Section 6.2 of the Agreement.  &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;The Coinbase Account Protection is not an insurance policy.  To the extent you require protection beyond the Coinbase Account Protection, we strongly encourage you to purchase an insurance policy or other protection that provides coverage for unforeseen events that may result in the loss of funds held in your Coinbase Account.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Well now we know we&amp;amp;#39;re where we need to be, when they&amp;amp;#39;re literally suggesting you get an insurance policy, excluding all security vulnerabilities of your devices, and excluding if you provide your credentials and/or MFA to a third party. Use an app to generate TOTP MFA codes? That&amp;amp;#39;s a third party. Use a password manager to generate extremely secure passwords? That&amp;amp;#39;s a third party. Surely they can&amp;amp;#39;t really mean all this, right?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Section 5: Data Protection and Security&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;5.2. Security Breach&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. If you suspect that your Coinbase Account or any of your security details have been compromised or if you become aware of any fraud or attempted fraud or any other security incident (including a cyber-security attack) affecting you and/or Coinbase (collectively a &amp;amp;quot;Security Breach&amp;amp;quot;), you must notify Coinbase Support immediately at &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://help.coinbase.com&quot;&amp;gt;https://help.coinbase.com&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; or (888) 908-7930 and provide accurate and up to date information throughout the duration of the Security Breach. You must take any steps that we reasonably require to reduce or manage any Security Breach. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Prompt reporting of a Security Breach does not guarantee that Coinbase will reimburse you for any losses suffered or be liable to you for any losses suffered as a result of the Security Breach.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;5.3. Computer Viruses.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;We shall not bear any liability, whatsoever, for any damage or interruptions caused by any computer viruses or other malicious code that may affect your computer or other equipment, or any phishing, spoofing or other attack.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; We advise the regular use of a reputable and readily available virus screening and prevention software. You should also be aware that SMS and email services are vulnerable to spoofing and phishing attacks and should use care in reviewing messages purporting to originate from Coinbase. Always log into your Coinbase Account(s) through the Coinbase Site to review any transactions or required actions if you have any uncertainty regarding the authenticity of any communication or notice.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yup, they definitely meant all that. If you get malware of any sort you&amp;amp;#39;re not covered. If you get phished, you&amp;amp;#39;re not covered. Now that we&amp;amp;#39;ve broken this all down, I&amp;amp;#39;m trying to think of a single scenario you might be covered, and all I can come up with is if Coinbase itself experienced a breach.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I don&amp;amp;#39;t even feel like going onto their final advertisement point of 24/7/365 customer support at this point, but that&amp;amp;#39;ll be a quick one.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;3) 24/7 priority support - Your dedicated Coinbase One team is standing by to help at a moment’s notice. Available 24/7/365, including weekends and holidays.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Section 5: Coinbase One&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;... (b) a dedicated customer support line available twenty four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week, three-hundred and sixty five (365) days a year ...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There aren&amp;amp;#39;t much details in the terms on this, but in reviewing other posts in this sub and others, as well as a few blogs - guess what? Your &amp;amp;quot;dedicated customer support line&amp;amp;quot; is a line to a call center rented by Coinbase. The people you&amp;amp;#39;ll talk to don&amp;amp;#39;t even work for Coinbase. So basically, you&amp;amp;#39;ve paid for an answering service like CallRuby. They&amp;amp;#39;ll be happy to read you some scripted responses, take down notes, and pass them along to Coinbase so Coinbase can try to assist you at a later point though.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I know this has been long, but I condensed it as much as I could. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Always read the terms.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; This $30/month subscription service is literally offering you &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;nothing&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, near-everything is excluded in their terms.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They don&amp;amp;#39;t need to accept Bitcoin or crypto, they can accept dollars and thus don&amp;amp;#39;t need to worry about implications of holding crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bye bye 3% fees, charge backs, minimum charges, 2-15 day settlement, etc.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s over. The battle for Medium of Exchange for the 21st century has been fought, and it has been won. GG.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

His sizable business runs on global online payments via legacy rails. We lost regular contact the past year or so but recently we started talking again and bonding over bitcoin. He got spooked by banking and by inflation and has converted 90% of his (significant) fiat wealth to bitcoin. We talk bitcoin a lot now and as a former aeronautical engineer, he gets it. Very interesting to see a guy as successful and intelligent as him make the switch to a bitcoin standard.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As we talked more about bitcoin, I started bringing up the Lightning Network. He had no idea what it was. I texted him and said: “download Muun wallet, go to lightning.store and buy something with satoshi’s from your Muun wallet.” He texted me 4 minutes later and his text just read: “Game over.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is a man who knows and has used legacy / fiat payment systems to build a multi-million dollar online tutorial business. He is very familiar with what exists and it’s limitations. He immediately understood why Lightning is a game changer from one use. I felt it was an extremely promising moment.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;(Yes, before of that I did spend a lot of time reading technical analysis book, reading blog posts, watching YouTube videos, but none of that really matter, it&amp;amp;#39;s mostly just luck.)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The smartest thing I&amp;amp;#39;ve done after making these profit is to quickly lock them into ETH 2.0 validator, so I keep myself away from gambling them away in market, and all my validators generate much more than I need for my monthly expenses.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I thought I&amp;amp;#39;m going to live a happy life after that enjoying all the money without having to work again, but one year later I find myself depressed, became a heavy smoker and drink quite often.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The reason is because I was a guy with big dreams, I wanted to have some achievement that I&amp;amp;#39;m proud to tell my family and friends, not how lucky I made some gambling money, but after getting these money, I&amp;amp;#39;m too afraid to make another move anymore, which made me feel like I&amp;amp;#39;m stuck.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Stuck because I do not have the experience or skills to get a job with rewarding that I feel like worth my time, nor want to work for anything less rewarding, especially when my validator income is like 5x~10x the salary of the job I can get.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And I obviously doesn&amp;amp;#39;t want to give up my wealth or take any more extreme risk with them, I believe I am not the only one feel the same, any thoughts?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;EDIT:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Thanks for all the response, didn&amp;amp;#39;t expect to receive so many replies, I really appreciate anyone who gave their advice, I would be going through one by one to read each of them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I understand that I will have to make some adjustment to my mentality, also happy someone recommended books, I do love to read books to learn different perspective to life.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This has nothing to do with centralization and it has nothing to do with the form of currency they’re ripping us off in. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto won’t solve asset seizure or sanctions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It’s not designed to help you evade your taxes. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It’s not going to “dethrone” fiat currency because it’s not a competition. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto is a tool like the internet is a tool. It’s one component in a large machine and can be used to serve and to fuck us, usually at the same time. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We aren’t going to replace governments with a crypto backed DAO because the problem corrupt governments isn’t that we don’t have a shared ledger. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anytime there’s a problem and you think crypto can solve it, consider what the problem actually is and what having access to shared record would solve with respect to that problem. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Media blackout in your war torn country? Crypto doesn’t solve this. PayPal, gofundme, etc stopped processing your cash? Unless you can exclusively pay all your bills and be paid in crypto, it won’t help you there either. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At the end of the day, remember what blockchain is. It’s a decentralized ledger. It’s a SQL database that everyone can see and no one can modify. Only it’s slower and consumes far more resources than a single SQL server. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Unless the issue is ultimately rooted in ineffective record keeping, crypto doesn’t really solve it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;I will just say outright I am not a fan, and let me tell you why...very few transactions are actually handled by bitcoin, and many of those do take place on bitcoin are illegal, illicit transactions&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

The whole criminals and terrorists use crypto narrative.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;To the extent it is used, I fear it&amp;amp;#39;s often for illicit finance&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://news.bitcoin.com/janet-yellen-admits-crypto-has-benefits-treasury-working-on-crypto-regulation/&quot;&amp;gt;And now&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; that all the big banks have started buying up crypto all of a sudden according to dear Janet &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Crypto has obviously grown by leaps and bounds and it’s now playing a significant role&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;There are benefits from crypto and we recognize that the innovation in the payment system can be a healthy thing&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What a surprise that the government employee&amp;amp;#39;s tone on crypto changes once the people with the money are starting to use it to make more money!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
