&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Extreme fear is still prevalent in the market, and some people will still waste their day watching the Bitcoin price constantly.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you&amp;amp;#39;re in the Bitcoin world for the long haul, and you&amp;amp;#39;ve chosen to be a HODLer, you&amp;amp;#39;d better put the Bitcoin price aside and move on to something more productive.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Specifically, if you&amp;amp;#39;re not a trader, there&amp;amp;#39;s no point in putting yourself through this all day. The market is red, but the fundamentals of Bitcoin keep getting stronger.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The best thing to do is to continue to focus on the long term. Move on and get ready to have a relaxed weekend away from the price of Bitcoin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;PS: If you&amp;amp;#39;re a trader, good luck to you in finding sleep in the coming days :P&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I won&amp;amp;#39;t be surprised if some people didn&amp;amp;#39;t take profits just for the fear of having &amp;amp;quot;Paper hands&amp;amp;quot;.
I can&amp;amp;#39;t vouch for other communities cause I just lurk around in this sub, and you will agree with me when I say that this community scorns those who even &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;think&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; of taking profits.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now, I can bet that a lot of people here regret not listening to their &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;own intelligence&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; and taking some sweet profits before the big red hit us all this year. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We chant &amp;amp;quot;Buy the dip&amp;amp;quot; everyday in this sub, hell even in the entire crypto world, but never have I heard someone say &amp;amp;quot;Sell the rally&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So here I am, giving you all a heads up for the inevitable crypto rally this year:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;It is OKAY to take some PROFITS !&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;It is OKAY to be able to sleep at night with no regrets.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;It is OKAY to miss some extra green because you didn&amp;amp;#39;t want to risk it.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Honestly, everyone who has been there in the crypto market books profit every now and then, they just keep it a secret. And all the newbies fall for the trap called &amp;amp;quot;HODL till death&amp;amp;quot;. Just don&amp;amp;#39;t do that. Hodl isn&amp;amp;#39;t some holy grail you need to abide by all the time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;DCA and HODL is definitely a very smart strategy to invest in good projects, but don&amp;amp;#39;t forget to get your family something nice with crypto profits. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In case you fear missing out on huge pumps, best hodl &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;some&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; while booking profits on a &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;small&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; percentage of your bag. This is a win-win situation where you minimize both risk and regrets while still HODLing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Lastly, If you have extra money, Buy the Dip fellas!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

It is a fact that bitcoin trends higher with time. Therefore in a year or so we will be laughing at these prices. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We all say we’re long term investing, but I don’t think people know what a long term investment means. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This means no matter what happens, YOU DO NOT SELL. Your scope is 5-10 years maybe even 3 but that’s what a long term investment is. You don’t just start selling at a loss at the first sight of trouble. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitcoin trends up with time. If you want to win you must HODL and buy more. These are the times when millionaires are made. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You will be rewarded for buying into fear. This is not hopium, this is a fact. Throughout history whenever markets have crashed, the ones that had money to buy the crash always came out on top. Nothing is lost until you sell.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As much as this sub preaches buy high sell low. Profits are taken at the top, not at the bottom. Bitcoin will survive and recover. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However the people who bought alts that have no purpose but hype at ATH’s are in for a rude awakening.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The inflation rate is now too much to ignore as the people realize that their buying power is deteriorating faster and faster with little being done about it. As money is harder to get with the Fed reducing its balance sheet, there will be less money to invest into Crypto and the market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;The Crash Has Already Started&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When the Fed announced it was going to be raising interest rates, I warned about a market crash in a post I made just 10 days ago. Unfortunately, the crash I was talking about has already started as the stock market has started going down very intensely. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/c1prsr60x0d81.png?width=843&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=0b0b9fcffc58081d9477139f54bf4334b97e94c3&quot;&amp;gt;Nasdaq Index Falling&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The pace at which the stock market is going down can very likely cause a situation like we&amp;amp;#39;ve seen in 2008. This is going to cause panic and sell offs among people. We can already see people cashing out their stock market gains due to recent price action.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Surging Inflation and Market Crash&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If we see the history, every time there was high inflation, the Fed artificially triggered a market crash by aggressively increasing interest rates.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/wd2srkb9x0d81.png?width=982&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=628ff4587a8298793996352607cec9b84c928f16&quot;&amp;gt;Inflation and Interest rate correlation&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This rise in interest rate and the planned decrease of the Fed&amp;amp;#39;s balance sheet is going to have a severe impact on the market as people start borrowing less, spending less and investments into all assets start to dwindle.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Biden Approval Rating&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/tbvvccadx0d81.png?width=1281&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e10b55e73781fccb335a8fb7f7203a709023a84b&quot;&amp;gt;Approval Ratings Fall Sharply Due To Inflation Concerns&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With more and more inflation, people are losing trust in the Government and the approval rating is going down. The main reason behind this huge fall in approval rating is inflation, and the government needs to tackle inflation if they want to keep their approval rating from falling even lower as the public takes notice of their bills. The approval rating is a sign that the government needs to do tackle inflation if it wants to keep public support.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;The Sell-off and the Opportunity&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With the market crash ahead being very likely, people are taking their money out faster and faster. The Fed is no longer giving them free money very soon. The amount of people that are buying assets very low considering the current situation, and it is likely going to start going down as the interest rates are yet to be increased, which is when we will see the peak effects of the upcoming crash.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However, when crashes are at their peak, they leave most assets EXTREMELY undervalued. These are the times when you want to dump money into things like Crypto, which can rise extremely fast during a bullish market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Crypto&amp;amp;#39;s Correspondence With the Stock Market&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Cryptocurrency market is strongly correlated with the stock market, especially after more and more institutions have started to invest in Crypto. The Crypto market WILL react if there is a downtrend in the general economy. That is basically the reason we saw another dip in Crypto&amp;amp;#39;s prices today.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;TLDR&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;: The Fed will be tightening its monetary policies due to inflation and the stock market has started to crash. With the stock market starting to go down, we&amp;amp;#39;re already seeing the Crypto market react today, and unfortunately if the general market continues to dip, so will Crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As far as I remember, Bitcoin was thought to be the solution of the fact that institutions, wall street and big money control the financial world and the pennies of the simple people from the normal population. And it was more or less like this, in the first several years after the inception of Bitcoin. We saw so much price discovery, Bitcoin being volatile, because mere mortals like us were buying, hodling, selling, wondering how much the &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;real&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; price of this asset is. It was literally supply and demand, controlled only by the psychology and the individual decisions of every single one of us.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What do we see nowadays? We go to bed, we wake up and we see that Bitcoin is at -10% for no reason. Literally for no reason. Neither me or you have sold. We were just sleeping. What happens? Bitcoin is strongly tied to the trading algorithms of insitutions and they handle it the same way they handle stocks. If the stock market is supposed to move down, bitcoin and crypto in general follows instantly in a nanosecond. We are not in control anymore. It doesn&amp;amp;#39;t matter if we buy or sell.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;During the last few years, we welcomed institutional interest and we cheered. Now I realize that they have much more power than us and the situation is the same as it has ever been - big money controls the pennies, or in this case the satoshis, of us - the simple people.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It makes me sad, but in the end, this is an open and free market. Everybody has the right to buy, sell or hold as much as he or she wants. In this case, it just happens so that the big players choose to be massively invested in crypto, which gives us the spot on the sidelines - sit and observe how the price fluctuates, without being able to react on our own.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;EDIT: I agree with a lot of you guys and girls. The same way sometimes we go to bed, wake up and see that Bitcoin is +15%. In those green days, nobody complains about it. What concerns me in overall is how tied the price movement of crypto assets to the price movement traditional assets is. I am not sure if this is an issue to be concerned about. However, it&amp;amp;#39;s a fact and I feel the necessity to talk about it and discuss it&amp;amp;#39;s impact.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;OK the price is low right now, prices have been falling and the whole market is fearful. Some people much smarter than me would say that this the time to buy, because this is when people get rich. Buy when there is blood on the street. Be greedy when others are fearful. That&amp;amp;#39;s all good and well, but for the rest of us that are fully invested - what the hell is happening?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;The Fed&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The US federal reserve recently announced that they will begin hiking interest rates and tapering their purchases of securities - why does this affect cryptocurrencies? The current economic environment was one of extraordinary monetary policy. The money printer was on full throttle and interest rates were at near zero for a huge amount of time. What was the cost of this? inflation. Now that inflation is up, the money printer has to be shut off, and interest rates have to be hiked. This is bad news for companies with a lot of debt (like tech stocks with high future growth priced in). So traders, hedge funds, retail investors start cutting trades, and taking profit. Also to fund their safer bets they need to sell riskier assets... it&amp;amp;#39;s a risk off environment. So risk is coming off, what is perceived as the riskiest asset out there? Cryptocurrencies. So we see trades unwind, as people panic. For context this is not just SCLP, or cryptocurrencies. At the time of writing NFLX is down 20%...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/0xv9rhv890d81.png?width=1326&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=123fcb75d5657b94cc30fbd290db5a83629f5753&quot;&amp;gt;Risk off&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The S&amp;amp;amp;P has broken out of a long term channel ..&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/rb7fw46e90d81.png?width=2754&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=0063b1a820fe2912fc41de401eb4b663ceb86f9c&quot;&amp;gt;Left chart is S&amp;amp;amp;P - which defines risk in the market, bitcoin is a much smaller market and so follows in its wake.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;So what should I do?&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Ask yourself a few simple questions - what is my investment horizon? What is my long term view on cryptocurrencies, and my chosen projects?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You need to look for projects that are tangible. You need to look for projects that you believe in. If you are feeling a mental strain, perhaps this is your first foray into the crypto markets - I would suggest making sure your investments are not too much for you to mentally handle. If you feel you are too at risk, then rebalance into less risky assets. Buy some bonds, which will do well in the increased interest rate environment. Then take a walk, live your life. The markets are volatile, they go up and they go down, but fear won&amp;amp;#39;t control the market forever. Think about why you invested in the space in the first place and ask yourself, has anything changed?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;We are in this together&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You are not alone. We will profit together, and people will think that the journey there was so easy - but we have to suffer to get there, which is something that the everyday person doesn&amp;amp;#39;t get. The pain we had to face along the way. It&amp;amp;#39;s a tale as old as crypto. Stay strong!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yes the BTC $100k dream is long dead for now but that doesn’t mean your investment isn’t a good one. You still have the same amount of coins which historically should again achieve the price you bought them at.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;People need to try and stay calm, if you plan on doing a trade it would be advisable to think about it, maybe delay 24h and see if it still feels like the right decision. Emotion trading often leads to bad decisions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you are feeling down definitely talk to family and friends for support.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;1. Feign ignorance.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Scenario: In a facetime call with your father and he asks you how &amp;amp;quot;that bitmoney of yours is doing&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Response: &amp;amp;quot;Bitmoney? Haha (fake laughter) you mean &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;bitcoin&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; dad. I was just joking about getting into it. What is it even?&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;2. Lie&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Scenario: Your mother texts you asking what you did with Grandpa&amp;amp;#39;s inheritance.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Response: &amp;amp;quot;Oh (stalling language to give you more time to assemble your thoughts), I put it into a high-yield savings account. Why? Will you be needing it in about 9-10 months time?&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;3. Redirect&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Scenario: You leave your desk for a cup of coffee and your co-worker shouts &amp;amp;quot;Hey! It&amp;amp;#39;s Mr. Funny-Money!&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Response: &amp;amp;quot;Hey! It&amp;amp;#39;s Mr. Give-his-wife-a-black-eye-so-she-leaves-with-the-kids!&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Scenario: Your wife is asking what happened to the money for the trip to Italy you were saving up for anniversary.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Response: &amp;amp;quot;Hang on I need to take a piss (do not go to the bathroom, but instead leave the house and run to a neighboring city and register under a new identity)&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;5. Hide&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Scenario: Your brother-in-law has tracked you down under your new identity of &amp;amp;quot;Janice Maria Juan Hernandez&amp;amp;quot; a trans-sexual erotic dancer, and phones you on your cell-phone.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Response: Do not pick up.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;6. Gas-light&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Scenario: Your boss is concerned about you because she noticed you stopped talking about cryptocurrency even though you were raving all about it throughout 2021.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Response: &amp;amp;quot;What? You were the one telling me about it. Don&amp;amp;#39;t you remember &amp;amp;#39;HODL, HODL&amp;amp;#39; and &amp;amp;#39;to the moon!&amp;amp;#39;? You were saying it all the time! (surreptitiously place your &amp;amp;#39;No sell &amp;amp;#39;til LAMBO&amp;amp;#39; mug on her desk) Look! Remember parading this around last summer?&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;7. Talk sense&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Scenario: Some drunk walks up to you on the street and says &amp;amp;quot;Cryptocurrencies are a fucking fraud man! I put all my savings into them and lost everything!&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Response: &amp;amp;quot;Listen you degenerate urchin (clinch to deflect his attack), a bear market is a natural process of any economic environment (duck a punch). If you can&amp;amp;#39;t handle the bear and hold, you don&amp;amp;#39;t deserve the bull&amp;amp;#39;s gold (parry his knife with your child).&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;8. Admit that maybe you are over-leveraged and that ultimately your life is more important than money.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Scenario: The police are speaking to you over a loudspeaker as you stand on the rooftop of your 12 floor office building.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Response: &amp;amp;quot;I&amp;amp;#39;ll come down for a crunch wrap supreme, chicken quesadilla, loaded fries, and a case of beer. NO CILANTRO. I SWEAR I&amp;amp;#39;LL JUMP IF YOU SCREW THIS UP.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With these steps in mind, hopefully you can stall long enough until your portfolio recovers and you can face your friends/relatives/parole officers with a straight face again.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There&amp;amp;#39;s a huge difference between losing 10k or $1000, so of course you&amp;amp;#39;d prefer losing less and not being affected by the crash, or possibly a bear market which won&amp;amp;#39;t recover for a long time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s also a great time to buy in my opinion, even though I&amp;amp;#39;m just speculating as everyone else and we might drop to 10k&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

With Bitcoin right at the $40k mark, this will be the last time in the foreseeable future you’ll be able to buy it this high a price. It’s time to go all-in and prove that you truly have diamond hands. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So what is my strategy-&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;1- early withdraw my 401k and invest it in BTC&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;2- get as many personal loans as I can and use those to buy ETH above $3k&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;3- go to the bank and get a reverse mortgage on my home &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With these 3 simple steps, I can set myself up to show that I have diamond hands and believe in crypto. It will lead to wife-changing money, as she will divorce me and I can focus purely on crypto. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I am also going to pressure my family and friends to invest blindly into crypto. If they can survive the next 3 years if a crypto winter, they will earn my respect. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Buy high, sell low. Not financial advice.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Does anyone have any idea what happened? What triggered this double digit dip? I know crypto is volatile but there has to be some kind of explanation or reasoning behind this.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;TLDR: Bullish and interesting&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Question 1 from  Diana Degette to  Ari Juels&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Is there a way to do Proof of work without wasting energy or electronic waste?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He answers that there is no other way but there is always Proof of Stake (he shills it at every occasion)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Question 2 (same speakers)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Do people have incentives to go to the cheapest energy to mine?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yes but there is always proof of stake (Diana Degette shuts him saying they&amp;amp;#39;ll come to that later) &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Question 3  Diana Degette to  John Belizaire&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Why the energy consumption is a feature not a bug?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;=&amp;amp;gt; The energy consumption is here to protect the network and lock in the value. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Question 4 Diana Degette to  Steve Wright&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Sometimes Renewable are not the cheapest right?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yes&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Question 5 Diana Degette to  Brian P. Brooks&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;You mention that proof of work can&amp;amp;#39;t shift to proof of stake why?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The proof of work makes a big value compared to other industries per consumption of energy. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Proof of Stake poses problems of security because of the holders but proof of work is more resilient and more decentralized&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;____________________________________________________________________________&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;New Character arrives: David McKinley &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_McKinley&quot;&amp;gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_McKinley&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cries about the hearing being a distraction from real problems. Says that states without renewable are discriminated because of renewable. He is mainly ranting. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;He asks: could miners rely on renewable to Greg Zerzan&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Answer: Yes as long as it is cheap and as long as the US is a net exporter of energy. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;____________________________________________________________________&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Back to  Frank Pallone  who asks: The concern about high power consumption and the future of it to Greg Zerzan&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Greg Zerzan speaks about data centers using also a lot of data. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Frank Pallone asks why the 0.5% of energy consumption is credible to Ari Juels&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Derived from Hashrate. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Frank Pallone asks Steve wright how can we make sure consumers don&amp;amp;#39;t pay more because of miners. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The dude lags hardcore and I can&amp;amp;#39;t get a grip of what the fuck he said. Seriously this is a US congress hearing and I have a better connection that this dude. (the congressman didn&amp;amp;#39;t understand too and asked for a written answer LMAO) &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Cathy McMorris asks of Zerzan how blockchain can empower the consumer?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He explains how it makes people control their data which undercuts Facebook, google and all other Big tech companies. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;McMorris explains how the job boom of blockchain is outpacing other industries and asks about the value from these jobs?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Zerzan explains how cryptos are the blood of the blockchain and that these experts are needed to make the cryptos and blockchain work. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Mc Morris asks Steve wright (the laggy boy) what are the negative impacts of crypto mining&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He says his community is scared by unregulated currencies and that they are skeptical about these technologies but doesn&amp;amp;#39;t answer the question. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;She explains how many assets exist and how the industry is growing and helping the world. She questions the sustainability. She explains that some leaders in the POW are trying their best to be green and to make big projects to develop a better power grid. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;She asks Brian P. Brooks What are the innovation in the future of the crypto mining?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Brooks explains how crypto is not about tax evasion or money laundering, he explains how bitcoin is the most decentralized crypto and that there is value in decentralization. He explains how companies in this space are starting to fight against the giant in tech. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;He says, decentralization is safer, fairer and the future.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;She asks John Bellzaire what are the exiled miners from China searching in the US ?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He explains that miners who have suffered from &amp;amp;#39;the great unplugging&amp;amp;#39; have been searching for a free market with a real ecosystem (insurance companies etc) rule of law and are trying to thrive in the larger US economy. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Is very pro crypto, says he accepts crypto campaign donations. He wants to &amp;amp;#39;let the market decide&amp;amp;#39;. He says that they should help crypto to thrive instead of regulating it. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He asks Brooks &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;how halving will help miners who are more efficients and to be more energy efficient?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Brooks explains that these halving are seen as the next big rise in the crypto sector and are pushing progress in a lot of other sectors such as cooling industries. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;He asks Brooks how chips technology is benefiting from Bitcoin POW.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Brooks explains how they have pushed specialized chip tech forward and that they made leaps comparable to the tech leaps produced by the Space program. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;He asks brooks if miners in other countries are dirtier, isn&amp;amp;#39;t the solution to welcome them in the US?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Brooks answers yes. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Focuses on the old plants re-opened and how economics can push the miners to fossil fuels. (She seems very old)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Asks about that to Steve Wright:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He answers that as coal is less and less demanded due to regulation, the prices get lowers and some may be interested in these products. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Asks John Bellzaire about cleaner sources and says she is skeptical about crypto and about the fact that they use fossil fuel. (she is anti crypto I think but yay) &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;John Bellzaire answers that Crypto brings huge capital which help with the transformative of the grid and of the zero carbon footprint. The capital deployed in clean energy is currently virtualy infinite because of subsidies and of crypto capital. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;She says that they should hope Bellzaire&amp;amp;#39;s vision comes to fruition &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;__________________________________&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Morgan Griffith asks if Southwest Virginia could profit from the fact that it has cold temperatures to Brooks.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Brooks says yes. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;He then asks the same to other people who say all yes&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;He voices concern that congress should not regulate the crypto space out of existence and asks Brooks what he thinks about this.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Brooks answers that Bitcoin&amp;amp;#39;s value is not about the market cap of Bitcoin but about the transactions and about the fact that Bitcoin is the bedrock of the crypto ecosystem. So Bitcoin should be protected. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;He asks Zerzan if China ban on crypto shows an anti freedom stance.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Zerzan says that crypto is freedom and some people don&amp;amp;#39;t like freedom. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;_______________________________________________________________&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Says that a lot of miners are interested in the energy in New York. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Asks Bellzaire if it is possible to ban crypto miners from fossil fuel?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bellzaire explains that this could be feasible through carbon tax credits or financial incentives to develop flexible load environement. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And that they could also incentive Green energy producer to team up with miners. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;He then Asks Juels if consuming excess energy from renewable has opportunity cost&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Juels answers by saying that he needs to repair something that was said: Mining rigs are more efficient over time but it doesn&amp;amp;#39;t mean that the energy infused has been reduced. And doesn&amp;amp;#39;t answer. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The law maker ask again why he believes that this excess energy is wasted when used on POW?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Juels answers that &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;it is because proof of stake exist and that the concerns about the centralization of POS are very theoretical. For him it is not proven yet that the validators could break it. He says that this energy could go else where gives a very bad answer.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Brooks says that yes, in fact the energy efficiency of energy/ hash has improved dramatically and that the industries benefiting from Asic have gained a lot thanks to the funding in R&amp;amp;amp;D funding from miners. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Asks to Juels why he says that it is in fact not reducing consumption or being more efficient.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Juels explains that he doesn&amp;amp;#39;t measure energy consumption / hash but per transaction and in that sense Bitcoin is very energy intensive. He also says that the lightening network is not used a lot and in its infancy and remains to be seen how succesful it is. (lol talks about millions of people using it daily...) &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Asks to Bellzaire how his vision of flexibility translate in application.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bellzaire answers that these datacenters decentralized could help with algorithms and other problems not only POW but bringing valuable applications. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Asks Steve Wright how they managed cost of energy to help consumers while allowing mining.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He answers that they have bought reserves and made contracts with miners (I can&amp;amp;#39;t understand him well) &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The law maker kim schrier is saying: Do you think that despite the ransomware, the drug and human traffics, are crypto really bringing value to humanity? (what a moron)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Steve Wrights says it depends, and it depends on regulations, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;he wants a mechanism to be sure crypto is not used in the wrong way (decentralization is not about this).&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;She then asks him about a dam contract with canada which is totally unrelated.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Directly asks Brooks if the number of miners is important.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Brooks answers that it is not that important &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;at least less than in proof of stake&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; since POW can&amp;amp;#39;t be tricked and the lottery makes collusion impossible but &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;proof of stake allows for collusion and modification of blockchain.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;She Asks Juels about proof of stake consolidation and is it a real alternative to POW.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Juels says that the concern is not about POS or POW but about centralization and that POW is not better in that front. Juels says that the real concern is about the rich being richer but that most problems are unrelated to POS or POW. (He is cheerleading for POS) &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Asks juels what is the danger of centralization&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Juels explains that the problem would be an overtake of the blockchain and a control of the transactions. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;________________________________________________________________________&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;New char: Tom O&amp;amp;#39;Halleran &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_O%27Halleran&quot;&amp;gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_O%27Halleran&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Asks Wright the difference between datacenters and crypto mining as consumers of energy.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Wright answers that data centers were better prepared to approach the energy industry and that Bitcoin miners were unprepared&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The lawmaker asks what growth in jobs is made in these industries&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bellzaire answers that the jobs produced per energy is not known by him BUT that they are creating high value jobs such as data technicians and that the value is high. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;____________________________________________________________________________________&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;New Character: Darren Soto  &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darren_Soto&quot;&amp;gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darren_Soto&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Says that Crypto is very mystifying and that Crypto can be a future, a currency, a commodity, and a security. This committee is the first to have passed bills to establish these kind of definitions and also taxation rules. He wants to make sure that Crypto is not used by terrorist and wants way to claw back some of the money. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Says he is concerned with the energy use and how coal plants are re-opened because of Bitcoin. He says that, if crypto is the currency of the future, we can&amp;amp;#39;t destroy the planet to make it work. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Asks Juels how Data oracles can make blockchain more efficient?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Juels says that oracles are not making these more efficient it is not their role. He says that Smart Contracts are actually at the core of this. He says that blockchain are not connected to internet and that the oracle is the link between blockchain and offchain systems. &amp;amp;#39;the eyes and ears of smart contracts&amp;amp;#39; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Asks Brooks what the gov should do to encourage less energy intensive efforts?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Brooks answers that the market is the best answer, it depends on a lot of costs and Bitcoin is an energy derivative which can be used to understand the best role of energy at a current time. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Brooks also says that his companies are talking to wind farms and solar farms, not coal plants. The anecdotal stories of coal plants are not the reality. The vast majority of Bitcoin miners are providing a base load consumption to Green energy producers.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;____________________________________________________________________________________&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The thing concludes with Degette saying that they are happy with answers today and want to know how in the future if miners are located in the US how will the energy spending evolve. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;She says that the testimonies were of the utmost value today.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The idea behind this setting is to hide comment scores to reduce &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwagon_effect&quot;&amp;gt;the bandwagon effect&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.  That is to say, visible comment scores introduce cognitive bias:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Most people are more likely to think a comment is good or bad based on how others have already voted&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;There is also the reverse bandwagon effect where people will intentionally do the opposite of what the popular opinion is&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Sometimes users will think a comment&amp;amp;#39;s score is too high or low and use their vote to correct it.  For example thinking a comment with 200 upvotes is good but not great, so they downvote it even though they thought it was good&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This kind of bias negatively influences they quality of votes because it considers how everyone else voted instead of just the quality of the comment itself.  Currently this setting is set to 5 minutes, but I&amp;amp;#39;m proposing that it be increased to 60 minutes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some additional technical notes:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Comment sorting is unaffected&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, even though the specific scores are not visible&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Your own comment scores are still visible to you&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, this only affects seeing scores on comments by other users&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Comment scores are still visible to mods so work against vote manipulation is unaffected&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The time to hide scores can always be adjusted again in the future&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;No. A bear market is an ACTUAL financial term, with an actual definition. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;a bear market has a very specific definition: when the market is down 20% &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;for at least a two-month period&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It does NOT matter if it hasn&amp;amp;#39;t dipped below the previous bottom, etc. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You&amp;amp;#39;ve all been deceived into thinking bear markets are bad. They&amp;amp;#39;re not. They&amp;amp;#39;re where accumulation happens. You can&amp;amp;#39;t properly DCA without dips.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: and for all of you saying &amp;amp;quot;Crypto is different!!!&amp;amp;quot;, would you have the same attitude if we were coming out of the bull market that got us to ~$1k?

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/5ks3gv1qtsc81.jpg?width=1247&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=0fbf56939bbe923c429c47518b6f608fe18a7ebb&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/5ks3gv1qtsc81.jpg?width=1247&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=0fbf56939bbe923c429c47518b6f608fe18a7ebb&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitcoin has also hit a pretty significant support level and is refusing to go below it. This is the same support level that Bitcoin held in late September before hitting a new all-time high.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The bearish price action we&amp;amp;#39;re seeing is still nothing compared to what happened from May - July.  In June/July almost everyone was calling for a bear market, but Bitcoin still recovered within a few months. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Hash rate shows market is undervalued rather than overvalued&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/q3oxrse2ysc81.png?width=1273&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=f764e0eea23cb0b849bbe263a3456f9ec3d57033&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/q3oxrse2ysc81.png?width=1273&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=f764e0eea23cb0b849bbe263a3456f9ec3d57033&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Moreover, a bear market usually comes when the entire market is overvalued, which seems far from the truth considering Bitcoin hit a new hash rate high. If Bitcoin was overvalued, hash rates reaching new highs would be completely irrational as Bitcoin is not cheap to mine. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;TLDR&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;: There is still hope in the market because there&amp;amp;#39;s still a high likelihood of the market bouncing back like it did in July and September. A -42% loss over a 2 month period is more of a correction than a bear market, and the metrics also show only one thing, and that is we are still far from a bear market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Problem&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Current Special Membership (Paid in MOONs) is not being used due to the simple fact that: price is 1,000 MOONs or 5$, no one will choose to pay 1,000 Moons - equivalent to paying ~118$!.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;——————————————————————————&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Solution&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Realistic Special Membership Cost, First step is changing the price to 100 MOONs.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Admins are now allowing updates to membership pricing, but do not yet support dynamic pricing. Once Moons can support this or mods are able to change the price monthly, we will use the following:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Subscription price will be algorithmically updated each month, after snapshot day and calculated like this:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;..&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;P * 100 / (1/R) = Membership Price in MOONs.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Where P is subscription price in USD.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; Membership Price in Fiat is 5$&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;R = Karma/MOON Ratio , R bigger than 0&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After simple operations this can be reduced it to &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;500 * R&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; which is much more convenient for users to calculate.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;..&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For example previous month ratio was &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rrinwg/new_moons_are_ready_round_21/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf&quot;&amp;gt;0.233&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Final Formula: 500R&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;500 * 0.233 = 116.5 MOONs&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;..&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This month ratio is &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/s81naj/new_moons_distribution_round_22_proposal/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf&quot;&amp;gt;0.277&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; :&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;500 * 0.233 = 138.5 MOONs&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;..&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;——————————————————————————&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You may think that keeping 1000 MOONs per membership is better because these MOONs gets “burned”.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These MOONs are not really getting burned, instead they get reintroduced in later rounds. This is artificial and temporary scarcity, why burning 1,000 and not 10,000 MOONs? 1,000 points was the initial default price that is supposed to be changed, after a year and a half there is still no change and it’s time to do so.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On top of that, 1,000 MOONs are getting burned from the Community Tank - wallet that is not affecting the market anyway. If users start to actually buy special membership using MOONs, these MOONs get burned from users - something that have impact on the market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I think this is impressive not just for CDC but for the crypto market in general, in building confidence in cryptocurrency. This is so vital considering how crypto is still held in suspicion by many.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To quote them:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto.com is introducing the Worldwide Account Protection Program (WAPP). WAPP offers additional protection and security for user funds held in the Crypto.com App and the Crypto.com Exchange.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;WAPP is designed to protect user funds in cases where a third party gains unauthorized access to their account and withdraws funds without the user’s permission. WAPP restores funds up to USD$250,000 for qualified users; terms &amp;amp;amp; conditions apply.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some noteworthy things you must do to qualify for the WAPP:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on all transaction types where MFA is currently available, &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Set up an anti-phishing code at least 21 days prior to the reported unauthorized transaction,&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Not be using jailbroken devices, &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;File a police report and provide a copy of it to Crypto.com; and &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Complete a questionnaire to support a forensic investigation.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The WAPP will begin rolling out in select markets starting 1 February 2022. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;CDC has also :&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;migrated to a new 2FA infrastructure, with a longer term plan to migrate  to true Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Introduced an additional layer of security on 18 Jan to add a mandatory 24-hour delay between registration of a new whitelisted withdrawal address, and first withdrawal.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Full audit of the entire infrastructure&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Engaged with third-party security firms to perform additional security checks + threat intelligence&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;And of course, all affected customers have been fully reimbursed.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Are we slowly accepting now that we&amp;amp;#39;re in a bear market? The number of people is dwindling down. Silver lining here is moon ratio prediction is a bit higher.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Hope this post can help :p&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Doubling scam&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Scam type 1 is the doubling scam. It turns out many newbies and even hardened veterans have fallen for these scams. The highest amount someone reported on my previous post was 11ETH(worth $33000)! They promptly deleted their comment so I will not be able to reveal their identity.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How does the scam work:-&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s a YouTube live video with 12-20K viewers. It is most likely a conference where famous people like Elon Musk or Jack Dorsey or Vitalik Buterin or CZ from Binance are present.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/mstzh88jvnc81.jpg?width=2340&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=4905037359f4572ac6902649c5635ee566d0c47f&quot;&amp;gt;Here is a screenshot. Shout out to u/fashion_hunger for the screenshot. Thank you so much!&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Looks pretty legit and official, right? CZ himself being present to conduct a giveaway? Well, it&amp;amp;#39;s not. As you can see that they require you to send crypto to their wallet to receive the double amount. It&amp;amp;#39;s a total scam!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How not to fall for it :-&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you visit their &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://2022-bnb.com/&quot;&amp;gt;website&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, there are three options. The first is BNB, the second is ETH and the third is BTC. Suppose you choose BTC, it will take you to another &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://2022-bnb.com/btc/index.html&quot;&amp;gt;page&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. If you scroll down you&amp;amp;#39;ll see this-&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/mu01atm2wnc81.png?width=2692&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=5523368e2862a719ff89eb721081552d0ede1eaa&quot;&amp;gt;The website claims that there are transactions happening every minute. This is just a screenshot of a few supposed transactions. There are multiple websites like this one, and their UI is just copy paste.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So there are supposedly transactions happening every minute. Well here&amp;amp;#39;s the catch, if you copy the address and search it on &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blockchain.com/&quot;&amp;gt;blockchain.com&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; you&amp;amp;#39;ll see that there have been only 2 transactions using this address. The website claims that there transactions happening every second, but in reality there are only 2 transactions linked with the wallet. So you can conclude that its a total scam! A little research and a simple tool is enough to conclude that this is totally a scam.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Fake miner/investment&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A user reached out to me(unfortunately he had fallen for the scam and lost $230), he shared some websites with me and chose to stay anonymous. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://alphacoins.net/&quot;&amp;gt;Like this one for instance.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; Pretty legit looking website. Got that google translate option as well.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How does the scam work :-&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So supposedly they are running a cloud mining operation. Someone would most likely contact you on platforms like telegram, the scammer posing as someone else. They&amp;amp;#39;ll tell you about how they made money with the mining operation. So you are somewhat convinced and you visit their website. Now the website has multiple &amp;amp;quot;plans&amp;amp;quot; which give different returns and have different minimums and maximums. And all of is just to make the operation seem legit. So you have invested in one of the plan and it shows you that the mining is in progress. When the supposed mining is done, you would obviously try to withdraw your money and here is when the problem starts. They will send you a mail saying that you need to migrate to another plan to withdraw funds, and to migrate to the other plan, you need to pay them more money. So they are just trying to milk you for more. Obviously you would go back to the person who first contacted you with your problem. They&amp;amp;#39;ll say that after migrating they were able to withdraw funds and send a bullshit confirmation like this as proof-&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/6zolxbq9wnc81.jpg?width=634&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=1fa27511f2dec51c6cc3c5b4cafb3436d0995d34&quot;&amp;gt;The proof sent by the scammer. Yes, Martha Lopez is a scammer.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I guess by now you have realised that you have fallen for a scam. And did I forget to mention that the user shared almost 4-6 websites, all similar, all claiming to be cloud mining operations. Some claimed that they are based in the UK and are listed as well. As I said, its all copy paste material.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How not to fall for it :-&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Well you&amp;amp;#39;ll have to do a little digging. Like in this instance, the scammers website claims that they are based in 80 Bendemeer Road, Singapore and are a listed company in Singapore as well. So I looked up 80 Bendemeer Road, Singapore and found the contact info of the building owners. I contacted them and asked if they have any company named Alphacoins as a tenant. Here is their reply-&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/9xgmttkewnc81.png?width=764&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=1dac270b38b33363aba6deae45bd39101d195598&quot;&amp;gt;No tenant named Alphacoins. It took the owners only 20 minutes to reply.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They have no tenant named as Alphacoins in 80 Bendemeer Road, Singapore. The owners replied to my mail in less than 20 mins. I wrote a professional e- mail, I never thought that I&amp;amp;#39;ll ever need to write a professional e-mail. And here I am doing it for you guys. A little digging can help you uncover their blatant lies and protect your money.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;What to do if you have fallen for one? :-&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Ok, you have fallen for a scam. What do you do now? The advice I am going to give is not original. It is from another &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/&quot;&amp;gt;r/CryptoCurrency&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; user I cannot remember(seriously please DM for credit).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The best you can do is inform the authorities and keep a track of your fund, meaning keep a track of where the scammer is transferring your crypto to. When the scammer transfers his crypto to a CEX, you&amp;amp;#39;ll be able to contact the exchange and get that scammer caught. Most exchanges require KYC so there is a chance that authorities are able to retrieve your crypto and identify the scammer(I can&amp;amp;#39;t remember the user who gave this advice, so if you are lurking, please contact me for credit.).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But there is a possibility that you are not able to recover your funds, best you can do in that case is save others by reporting the scammer and their wallet on sites like &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://scam-alert.io/&quot;&amp;gt;scam alert&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; or &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bitcoinabuse.com/&quot;&amp;gt;bitcoin abuse.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; There is a good chance that someone might visit these website&amp;amp;#39;s and search for the address that scammed you and save their money.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Conclusion :-&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I really hope this post is able to help you, I know I haven&amp;amp;#39;t covered all the possible scams. There are too many!! And each is more complicated then the other!!! But the 2 I have explained should be enough to give you a idea of what most scams look like and how you can save your funds. Hope this post is able to help :-)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

It&amp;amp;#39;s especially stupid because banning the mining of crypto won&amp;amp;#39;t have any impact on the environment at all because people with mining rigs won&amp;amp;#39;t just pull the plug on them and call it a day. No, they will repurpose them for other uses like cloud computing, neural network training or even (cloud)gaming.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

There are more WallStreet paper claims to gold (&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;future contacts and whatnot&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;) than actual gold, so WallStreet and central banks just &amp;amp;#39;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;trade/swap&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#39; these claims back and forth with each other all buddy buddy. WallStreet controls most of the actual gold in the world, not individuals with the paper claims.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Similarly, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;there are more paper claims to Bitcoin than actually Bitcoin thanks to leverage, margins, futures trading, and ETFs; WallStreet is applying their same debt-based paper system to the equity based (real value) crypto asset Bitcoin as they do to suppress gold price.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; So for every Bitcoin on the block chain, 10, 50, 100 people could have a &amp;amp;#39;claim&amp;amp;#39; to that Bitcoin. Legit the 0.01btc I look at on my CoinBase could be the &amp;amp;#39;same&amp;amp;#39; one you look at due to lack of CEX transparency and oversight of their lending practices! This means there is an artificially larger supply of Bitcoin in circulation; and we all know &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;price is a supply and demand equation!&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This means if there is truly that real demand in those 50-100 people who bought and are hodling that 0.01, if all that real demand is being met and satisfied with an artificially large supply, then &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;the TRUE PRICE of Bitcoin should be much much higher!&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; If there is a &amp;amp;#39;run&amp;amp;#39; on Bitcoin (consumers increase purchasing in fear of a shortage) there will not be enough Bitcoin on exchanges to fulfil demand, because most Bitcoin is stored in cold-wallets off of exchanges.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When someone creates an artificial supply of something like WallStreet has done with gold and is now doing with Bitcoin, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;THAT LEADS TO PRICE SUPPRESSION!&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Imagine a run, we all sell our 0.01 btc, the CEXs will not have enough fiat to deliver and would desperately be trying to find collateral - that they couldn&amp;amp;#39;t get - because it does not exist - and the price would skyrocket!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Let me explain again because it&amp;amp;#39;s weird to wrap your head around.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; When we take fiat to the spot market and bid at a suppressed price, at some point there will be no more Bitcoin left to bid on. So we bid higher and higher for this heavily demanded asset! As we bid higher, other HODLers become tempted to sell (wen Lambo? Now!) Bitcoin gets transferred from weak hands to diamond hands and spot price is driven up by the people who want real Bitcoin! If WallStreet wants to drive the price back down to the futures price, they&amp;amp;#39;d have to initiate an arbitrage strategy with Bitcoin in reserve - but &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;THEY HAVE NO BITCOIN LEFT!&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; They will only hold future paper contracts or fiat - causing the price to continuously get bid up higher!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is why it&amp;amp;#39;s so important to transfer your Bitcoin off of exchanges and into a cold storage wallet. The more Bitcoin is off exchanges the larger the short squeeze will be and the less fractional reserve practice bullshit can occur. They will not own the actual Bitcoin like they do the gold, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;WE WILL OWN IT.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Therefore this type of suppression is unsustainable, so buckle up.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Such activity also contributes to fiat inflation, which strengthens both the demand and awareness of Bitcoin itself!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Blockchain provides a single source of truth for both ticket holders and organizers. The transfer of NFTs from the initial sale to resale is stored on the blockchain immutably so that all parties can prove the ticket’s authenticity.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;In cases where the resale of tickets is forbidden, NFTs can be developed as non-transferrable, not to be moved to another buyer physically.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Reduce costs&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Costs associated with selling and minting NFTs are negligible as compared to the traditional ticketing system. You can get an unforgeable ticket for less production cost so that customers and organizers can validate the authenticity of every ticket on the chain and track the history of ownership.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Perpetual revenue&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Since programmable NFTs can have built-in rules for merchandise, content, resales, and royalty splits, it means that the organizer can analyze profit sharing percentages for future resales or creative content on secondary markets and receive funds knowing they are unalterable within the NFT’s coding.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;New revenue opportunities&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;NFT-based tickets act as programmable money, providing unlimited potential for new revenue opportunities. For example, the resale of NFT tickets as collectibles, using NFT tickets to provide food and drink deals and rewarding fans who have gathered many event tickets.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
