We acquire, consume, and create content and services with a  few clicks or taps of our fingertips. Exponential increases in compute  performance, enabled by Moore’s Law, play a significant role in making  these experiences seamless. Moore’s Law is also enabling us to  democratize access to this enormous pool of processing power. Amazing  things happen when a lot of compute is available to a lot of people  without much friction.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We are looking forward to the next set of amazing things.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Blockchain  is a technology that has the potential to enable everyone to own much  of the digital content and services they create. Some even call it an  inflection point in computing, fundamentally disrupting the way we  store, process and transact our digital assets as we usher in the era of  metaverse and Web 3.0. No matter how the future evolves, it is certain  the availability of a lot more compute to everyone will play a central  role.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Today, we at Intel are declaring our intent to contribute to  the development of blockchain technologies, with a roadmap of  energy-efficient accelerators. Intel will engage and promote an open and  secure blockchain ecosystem and will help advance this technology in a  responsible and sustainable way.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We are mindful that some  blockchains require an enormous amount of computing power, which  unfortunately translates to an immense amount of energy. Our customers  are asking for scalable and sustainable solutions, which is why we are  focusing our efforts on realizing the full potential of blockchain by  developing the most energy-efficient computing technologies at scale.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Our  blockchain accelerator will ship later this year. We are engaged  directly with customers that share our sustainability goals. Argo  Blockchain, BLOCK (formerly known as Square) and GRIID Infrastructure  are among our first customers for this upcoming product. This  architecture is implemented on a tiny piece of silicon so that it has  minimal impact to the supply of current products.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Intel Labs has  dedicated decades of research into reliable cryptography, hashing  techniques and ultra-low voltage circuits. We expect that our circuit  innovations will deliver a blockchain accelerator that has over 1000x  better performance per watt than mainstream GPUs for SHA-256 based  mining. You will be able to learn more about our circuit innovations at  the International Solid State Circuit Conference (ISSCC) this month.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To  support this, and additional emerging technology, we have formed the  new Custom Compute Group within Intel’s Accelerated Computing Systems  and Graphics business unit. The objective of this team is to build  custom silicon platforms optimized for customers’ workloads, including  blockchain and other custom accelerated supercomputing opportunities at  the edge.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Onward, we aspire to leverage technologies from our  zetta-scale computing initiative to deliver energy-efficient solutions  that make our tomorrow better than our today.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When I originally bought cypto, it was as a hedge to the stock market. And it worked that way for a while.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m not sure what happened in the last 2-3 years but now Crypto just follows the market. If the market is down cyrpto is down. If it&amp;amp;#39;s up, crypto is up. My assumption is cyrpto just got way too big the last few years and it just follows the bigger market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I thought crypto was suppose to replace a lot of commodities? Turns out it’s just another temperature gauge of the market? Clearly not a hedge.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At this point, why not just buy SPY instead?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That probably also was the reason why Satoshi Nakamoto disappeared. Crypto is about being anonymous, it&amp;amp;#39;s about having a decentralized system where you don&amp;amp;#39;t have to trust anyone (obviously that does even today not happen everywhere in crypto).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If Satoshi would have still been here and available to everyone. He would be seen as the big CEO of Crypto by some people that do not have real knowledge about crypto. And that would have been another argument for them to call it a &amp;amp;quot;scam&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Him not being here makes crypto what it was always meant to be: decentralized. No one is up there, we just don&amp;amp;#39;t know who made it. It&amp;amp;#39;s anonymous.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Two years later an institutional wave of money is now entering.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;El Salvador bought bitcoin in 2021, by 2023 a wave of sovereign nations will be buying bitcoin to hold as reserves.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitcoins fair value is somewhere between gold and global debt which is between $10 trillion and $200 trillion ($500k to  $10 million per coin).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;New tech is always overvalued before it is fully adopted just like the dot com bubble in the 90s getting way ahead of itself before most people even had a home internet connection.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitcoin will not rise slowly. It will not give people the chance to take their time. It will melt faces off as it leaves everyone behind. A million dollar bitcoin will not take another 10 years, and it doesn&amp;amp;#39;t need to be held by five billion people to get there. It will be overvalued well before mainstream adoption takes place. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Once institutional fomo is well underway and sovereign nation fomo is heating up the price will rise by $100k in a month. It took 12 years to go from zero to a one trillion dollar market cap and once we are solidly above one trillion it could reach two trillion in a matter of months.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitcoin will find its true value somewhere between $500k and $10 million per coin and it will happen faster than anyone on earth could possibly imagine.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

There is finally  something that can show the world the capability of  blockchains and what crypto is capable off, and instead it is turn into a cash grab of JPEGs and weird antics.  It was kind of neat as a novelty but now not so much.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But NFT is so  much more and it deserves better. Lets change things by decoupling the JPEG from NFT. I will start first. Here is a random list.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Land deeds and proof of ownership. The really cool thing about this is that it can even over time keep track of changes to the property.

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;There is a recent Florida auction that was sold this way and attracted over 7,000 bidders.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Medical records. Imagine your own medical NFT ledger that you can give access to and can deny at will. This includes tracking your access of your data for research/insurance/marketing.

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;George Church has started a genome sequencing company called Nebula that is exploring this.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;ever got to a new doctors office and filling a shit load of paper work, twice?  Well with NFT it could be just a simple access request.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;IP/patents can be documented and verified so that there is no question who invented what.

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m not just talking about selling the NFT as a patent but literaly to track work related to the patents. This is a huge issue when it comes time to say who invented what and who gets the patent. The latest controversy was with CRISPR.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;any type of ID can now be easily verified and difficult to fake - that means someone can&amp;amp;#39;t just scan your driver license and make a clone of it.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Ticketmaster killer, you know what I mean here. And NFT tickets can easily be linked to special subevents like autographs, special access and what not.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Linking to real world assets to ensure authenticity. One I heard of recently is linking the odometer in cars and preventing people from turning it back.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Anything that requires  a real life contract.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;notary.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;etc.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;the point is that its not something hypothetical; its real and  its probably one of the easiest way to increase use of cryptocurrency and blockchains.  So lets not do it any more damage by constantly linking JPEGS/digital arts to NFT because its so much more.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;thanks for reading.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In case you haven&amp;amp;#39;t caught one of my other AMA&amp;amp;#39;s, I am a US-based attorney practicing cryptocurrency law with a strong emphasis on questions of taxation. I&amp;amp;#39;ve been in the cryptocurrency space as an investor since 2013, so I&amp;amp;#39;ve seen much the development of the cryptocurrency community, regulations, and use-cases first-hand. As a practicing attorney I consider it a privilege to have successfully shifted my hobby into a career in such an excitng, cutting-edge field of law. Now that tax season is in full swing again, I wanted to drop in and host another AMA as Americans start the process of untangling their 2021 cryptocurrency activity. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As always, I&amp;amp;#39;ll try to respond to as many questions as possible, including in the coming days/weeks, so if you&amp;amp;#39;re late to the party please feel free to drop your comment/question and I&amp;amp;#39;ll circle back to provide answers when I have the time. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Disclaimer: This AMA is not the place to get specific legal, tax, or investment advice. Everyone&amp;amp;#39;s tax situation is different, so you should always consult with your own tax professional before acting on anything you read online. What makes sense for one person&amp;amp;#39;s situation might not make sense for you. For this reason, this AMA is for general informational purposes only and does not create any professional attorney-client relatioships. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Well, I have spent the last few months hanging out around here, and I believe I have found why that is : delusion and collective hysteria. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Seriously, I love this sub, but it has to be one of the biggest echochamber out there, its even worse than wallstreetbets. Every bullish comment gets upvoted, and every even so slightly bearish comment gets downvoted, thats the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/cryptocurrency&quot;&amp;gt;r/cryptocurrency&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; way! People get told to buy when the coin is up, when its down, when it rug pull, before the update, after the update, after the news, if you&amp;amp;#39;d listen to people here you&amp;amp;#39;d always buy! Not only that, but you&amp;amp;#39;d buy the shitcoins that get promoted over and over again. If you even dare suggesting that an altcoin in particular might not be of much value long term, you get the army of shitcoin bagholders to silence you.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The result, is people are scared to say what they think, they dont wanna go against the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/cryptocurrency&quot;&amp;gt;r/cryptocurrency&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; party line.What makes things worst is the moon system, which litteraly provide rewards for participating in the echochamber. The more bullish the comment, the higher the upvote! This cycle fuels a machine which slowly makes all of us more and more delusional, until we inevitably fall into collective hysteria. Problem is when you leave this sub, you sometimes don&amp;amp;#39;t realize you&amp;amp;#39;re also leaving the dogma, and everyone else that wasnt exposed to it perceive your opinion as absurdly bullish, leaving them thinking that you&amp;amp;#39;re either crazy or full of shit.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I dont have a solution to offer, I just wanted to point it out.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Its renouned worldwide . Bottles  of wine start at $500. All that to say that the food should be amazing.  Only for you to be served chicken tendies and soggy fries from the kids  menu.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You look around then down at your plate. &amp;amp;quot;I thought this was supposed to be good?&amp;amp;quot; You think to yourself.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here comes your buddy, the guy who invited you to the restaurant. (Put in his entire life savings in at $0.35)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Told you this place is the shit bro.&amp;amp;quot; Your buddy says as he sits down and is served a TV dinner from Banquet.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Oh  yeah the food isn&amp;amp;#39;t great... right now. But wait until later trust me  bro.&amp;amp;quot; He says as he starts to unwrap the plastic film with a big grin on  his face.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Just as you were about  to take a bite of your tendie Allincrypto sits down at your table. &amp;amp;quot;Sup  boys, Allincrypto here.&amp;amp;quot; Then immediately takes a bite of a turd Charles  Hoskinsin layed on his plate.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Oh my favorite!&amp;amp;quot; He says as he leans forward and eats the log apple bobbing style with no hands.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Don&amp;amp;#39;t think about your food now. Think about the filet mignon of tomorrow.&amp;amp;quot; As he goes in for another bite.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Disgusted,  you look out the window at a run down diner across the street. You peer  into the window and see families laughing and having a good time. You  see the waitress walk over to the table with what looks like a bacon  cheeseburger and a new york strip steak.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Wow that looks pretty good.&amp;amp;quot; You mutter to yourself.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Just as you say that Allincrypto and your buddy surround you.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;That place is so shit.&amp;amp;quot; They say in unison as they both proceed to shut the curtains from each side.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Right before the curtains fully close you look up at the neon sign above the diner. It reads &amp;amp;quot;Ethereum diner&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You turn around and stand up. Everyone in the restaurant has stopped eating and is glaring at you in complete silence.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Hail Hydra&amp;amp;quot; they start chanting.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They all get up and start to surround you while still chanting &amp;amp;quot;Hail Hydra&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A woman shouts from the back, &amp;amp;quot;Hydra will save us! Kill the non believer!&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Im  sorry! I will eat my tendie please don&amp;amp;#39;t hurt me! That place across the  street sucks.&amp;amp;quot; But it doesn&amp;amp;#39;t work and they proceed towards you slowly.  You shut your eyes and prepare for the worst.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You suddenly wake up in your bed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Omg it was a dream. Thank god.&amp;amp;quot; You think to yourself.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You pull out your phone to look at your portfolio.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;$10,000 bought at $2.68. Portfolio down 69.420%&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You  walk over to the bathroom and catch a glimpse of yourself in the  mirror. You smile with a tear rolling down your cheek. You notice your  teeth are smeared with shit.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;I wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t have it any other way.&amp;amp;quot; You think to yourself.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You proceed to go on Reddit to post about the new Solana outage and check what new features are coming soon to Cardano.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You look right into the camera. After a long pause you smile and shout &amp;amp;quot;Hail Hydra&amp;amp;quot; at the top of your lungs.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The  camera zooms away from your face and out of your RV thats parked in  front of your step dads house and the credits start rolling.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After first learning about bitcoin in 2012, and feeling like I missed the boat in the 2013 bull run, I decided to start buying modest amounts in January 2014. In hindsight they weren&amp;amp;#39;t modest at all. I was buying .5 or entire bitcoins every month. Over the next 2 years, I accumulated (and spent) anywhere between 6-12 btc. I wasn&amp;amp;#39;t super detailed with my records at the time, and I spent a bunch of it frivolously. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I ended up buying a house in 2016, and I sold the rest of my stack for the down payment, just before the 2017 run up to 20k, so I missed out on all those gainz. Over the next 2 years I didn&amp;amp;#39;t buy anything, but I still watched the market. In 2019 I started buying again. It has taken over 2 years, but I have successfully joined the &amp;amp;quot;10 millionth club&amp;amp;quot; (2.1btc is a 10 millionth of the entire bitcoin economy). To think I had a realistic shot at 21btc if I&amp;amp;#39;d just stuck with it. Ah well. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyway, the point of this post is to say keep stacking and hodling. We are still early, even though we always feel late. Pretty weird.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;tldr&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; i just dca&amp;amp;#39;d for 2 years and now I have 2.1 btc&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Lately I’ve noticed lots of people here heavily over leveraged in CRO attempting to obtain the next level of card. Don’t get me wrong, the benefits are great, but BENEFITS ALONE could never warrant putting such a high percentage of your portfolio into a project that has a lot to prove. While CRO is far from a shitcoin, it is also far from a blue chip, and if crypto.com doesn’t flourish, the coin itself really has little to no use. If you’re shooting for the next card up remember, it’s not a race, slowly work your way there as your portfolio grows.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;EDIT - First of all, I should have said “over allocating”, not over leveraging. I thought it was obviously enough but that’s on me.   Second, not spreading fud, not scoffing at cro. I’m saying the card and rewards are great, Just a reminder not to over allocate your portfolio for any type of rewards with any company&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Those days are gone now that YouTube has removed the Dislike Count.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now scammers are just out on YouTube and scam people so blatantly because all people see is the number of thumb-ups.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is exactly why I had always told people to avoid finding crypto advice on TikTok in the first place, because all you see is the number of hearts, and many just fall for the scams if the number of hearts is high.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My point is that if you were careful with the content on YouTube before, you have to be extra careful now.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
