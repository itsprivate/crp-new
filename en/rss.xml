This is mainly because there are absolutely aspects of crypto investing that give off Ponzi vibes to the uninitiated - just look at all those rugged tokens, even the DAO&amp;amp;#39;s that make headlines because of sudden price plummets etc. And no doubt the 2017ish Bitcoin craze where thousands of people bought the top before a very cold winter is still fresh in people&amp;amp;#39;s minds, alongside BTC&amp;amp;#39;s current price situation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So my question is: how do you guys address the common accusation that we&amp;amp;#39;re all just crabs trying to claw our way to the tippy-top of a grand digital ponzi? Many thanks.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Edit:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; To those saying &amp;amp;quot;nothing&amp;amp;quot;, I appreciate the pragmaticism - but I&amp;amp;#39;m after retorts that address the core scepticisms that a lot of people display towards crypto. Either way, I always ask myself &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;am I still early??&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; I wonder if the internet&amp;amp;#39;s early days were met with a similar response.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The investigation: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.occrp.org/en/suisse-secrets/historic-leak-of-swiss-banking-records-reveals-unsavory-clients&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.occrp.org/en/suisse-secrets/historic-leak-of-swiss-banking-records-reveals-unsavory-clients&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These are some of the clients of the bank described in the whistleblower article: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A Yemeni spy chief implicated in torture. The sons of an Azerbaijani strongman who rules a mountainous territory as his own private fiefdom. Bureaucrats accused of looting Venezuela’s oil wealth and hastening its descent into humanitarian crisis.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Credit Suisse’s clients included the family of an Egyptian intelligence chief who oversaw torture of terrorism suspects for the CIA; an Italian accused of laundering criminal funds for the infamous ‘Ndrangheta criminal group; a German executive who bribed Nigerian officials for telecoms contracts; and Jordan’s King Abdullah II, who held a single account worth 230 million Swiss francs ($223 million) at its peak, even as his country raked in billions in foreign aid.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Venezuelan elites accused of plundering the state oil firm funneled hundreds of millions of dollars into Credit Suisse accounts. The money flowed during a period when widespread looting from government coffers precipitated an economic collapse that has prompted six million people to flee the country and driven others into near starvation. The bank kept its Venezuelan clients’ accounts open even as global media exposed corruption cases against many of them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These kind of people have zero problems laundering their ill gotten wealth via the banking system, but damn if you earned more than $600 in staking rewards, you have to start reporting via Form 1099, if you spend $10k in crypto, it will have to be reported directly to the IRS. All these regulations and laws are put in place to track crypto because regulator and central bankers constantly attack crypto as a conduit for money laundering. However the biggest criminal enterprises solely rely on the banking system for laundering their funds.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Drug cartels or Venezuelan elites who looted their own government have no issues with KYC, but if you make a p2p or anonymous crypto transaction, you can risk your funds being locked!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The loops you have to go to have your crypto income accounted as a legitimate source of earning, only for those in the government to accuse crypto of facilitating money laundering, crimes and whatnot...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But when the actual allegations come out its invariably the central banking system that facilitates money transmission operations for some of the largest criminal enterprises in the world, including drug cartels and human rights abusers and corrupt rulers. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These are quotes from employees of Credit Suisse:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“When someone wants to engage in money laundering after he loots assets of the country, for example, he needs to transfer the money. So holders of big accounts go directly to the very senior managers,” he said.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The system was based on plausible deniability, said former employees. Bankers are given strict rules, but the incentives are to ignore them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“The bank’s compliance department are masters of plausible deniability,” the former senior manager said. “Never ask a question you do not want to know the answer to.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fast forward to a whole 7 days later and there are multiple posts about being in a crypto winter for the foreseeable future. This is the volatility that comes with the territory of being in the space so instead of riding the roller coaster it might benefit some to just unplug from the daily/weekly news and chart watching. If you set your limit orders and price alerts then go live your life, it’s much harder to be affected by the constant volatility. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Who knows what’s in store for next week? Personally I think it’s bearish news for the foreseeable future with, coming interest rate hikes, tax season, and the constant threat of global conflict despite institutional involvement being at an all time high.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

So please keep an open mind.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here&amp;amp;#39;s my story:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Installed Nami wallet. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Started a withdrawal of just 5 Ada from Kraken to this wallet, it took 30 minutes (??) for funds to arrive.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Went to SundaeSwap, tried to swap 1 Ada for 1.4 Sundae but kept saying that I have insufficient funds, apparently Sundae has additional fees that I was not aware of (2.5 Ada + some refundable deposit of 2 Ada).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Waited another 30 minutes to withdraw more Ada.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Big red warning on the Sundae page that the network is heavily congested. Checked the explorer and blocks were indeed (85%+) full while running at 2 tps. How is that possible?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;First 4 swap attempts failed with 0 warnings, nothing to be found on-chain in the explorer, just pending attempts that disappeared after reconnecting my wallet.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The 5th one I think was recorded on-chain and remained in pending.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;40 minutes later another on-chain swap attempt magically appeared, probably from the first 4 &amp;amp;quot;failed&amp;amp;quot; txs. Wtf?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Tried to cancel this second order...cancellation pending with 0 feedback on what is happening, tried to cancel 3 more times... nothing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Exactly one hour and 7 minutes later the first swap completed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m used to getting near instant confirmations and swaps on other networks, 1 hour+ is definitelly the longest I&amp;amp;#39;ve ever had to wait on any Dex by a factor of 1000x and combined with all the fails and weird behaviour that I got I can&amp;amp;#39;t call this a good UX. What exactly went so wrong and what&amp;amp;#39;s the solution? Please don&amp;amp;#39;t call me a fudder because none of this is made up and anyone can try it for themselves.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

But also major movements are the time where this sub is overly bipolar. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This sub is something way more volatile than crypto. Any minor movement causes a complete shift from bull to bearish in this subs sentiment. And during major movements like this, the sub goes completely crazy. Making predictions of either 100k in a week or as now 18k tomorrow. If you would listen to this sub you would absolutely master buy high sell low. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You should not listen to anyone actually during rough times and during very amazing times. Those are the moments you should keep your plan to yourself. Just strictly follow it and sell/buy when YOU think it&amp;amp;#39;s right. That way you won&amp;amp;#39;t regret it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The main focus, as Vitalik stated, should be 2 things:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;• The move to PoS&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;• Sharding&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Any additional features are just polishing the network to make it as perfect as possible.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the meantime, Vitalik is solely focused on Zk rollups as the future of scalability for Ethereum.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This decision to build around rollups came back in 2020 when Vitalik wrote an article titled “A roll-up-centric ethereum roadmap” where he explained how Ethereum would be all in on rollup tech (Give it a read its very interesting).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I guess this is why he’s so fond of MATIC recently considering they’ve invested into every single ZK rollup tech available on the market and have proven to be top dogs when it comes to scalability.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So while the final stage or ETH2.0 might take a while, we should soon start seeing a lot more improvement from both Ethereum and side chains like Polygon.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

About two weeks ago I recently won a little bit of money gambling and couldn’t transfer it to my bank, I could however withdraw it in BTC and was just going to set up an account on Coinbase and withdraw it when it hit. I didn’t know anything about BTC or crypto (and I still know very little) and after this price drop I started panicking a teeny bit and was confused. I found the subreddit  and started browsing it and I realized, Bitcoin isn’t about making a profit or a quick buck, it’s a slap in the face to the government and banks who think they can control every aspect of our life. It’s a slap in the face to people like Trudeau who thinks they can freeze our accounts because we don’t comply to their every demand. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thank you all for showing me the real meaning behind crypto and BTC. Going to invest a little more and get a cold wallet soon. F the Gov n F the greedy ass banks.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

This resulted in their project&amp;amp;#39;s hype almost dying just before the release of their NFT project (It later got removed from Open Sea). Yet after a few hours of release they still made about 7 million dollars. How does a project associated with NFT scam make 7 million dollars?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Looking close at those 7 million dollars. A lot of the buyers were brand new . I mean, there were so many that had never done anything on ether scan before. A series of shadow wallets all created by one person that was all buying tons of Squiggles. Millions of dollars worth of fake volume and then immediately flipping them on open sea for less money.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/aj4gj6wqhui81.png?width=1920&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=9d8bd44803349f78092840e79a7068f15225c8fe&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/aj4gj6wqhui81.png?width=1920&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=9d8bd44803349f78092840e79a7068f15225c8fe&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/t29cy81shui81.png?width=1920&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=9360c5cbf28912b9d0d826a9f2407648e0b429a4&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/t29cy81shui81.png?width=1920&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=9360c5cbf28912b9d0d826a9f2407648e0b429a4&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A single account, that spent 800 Ethereum, which is over 2 million dollars spread across two transactions, that created hundreds of new wallets .Each of these shadow wallets, then bought three squiggles a piece and immediately listed them on open sea for less money.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You might be wondering why do this? Why buy two million dollars worth of squiggles only to sell them for less? Well, the only reason that makes sense to me is they were trying to give the illusion of huge interest to get people to buy in to make people think this had a lot of trading volume , a lot of hype. The only people who could possibly want to do that is of course the team behind squiggles.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

My husband has been investing for several years and I was skeptical at first.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He has always talked about how he’d love to Bitcoin mine on a small scale. Around December, I told him we should do it. Our current home would sell for a great price, we’d move to a state with the best energy rates (Arkansas is our choice). We’re going to buy a much less expensive home with land, pay for it almost in full with the equity from our current home and buy 11-12 machines to start with the remaining equity.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We’ve already calculated everything - the energy costs in the area we’re purchasing in and how much profit we’d make as well. We wouldn’t be living luxuriously, especially with two young children, but it would be enough to pay the bills and my husband to not need to work anymore.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I’m nervous about this new adventure, but also excited.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you have any helpful and kind advice, I’d greatly appreciate it :)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I am not from the US, so not an expert on all of this, but quick summary what happened:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Last October, it became public, that some Fed officials had &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/17/after-years-of-being-squeaky-clean-the-federal-reserve-is-surrounded-by-controversy.html&quot;&amp;gt;been trading stocks and bonds that could be influenced at least indirectly by their decisions&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. And, weirdly enough, it seems this wasn&amp;amp;#39;t against any rules - and to be fair, this doesn&amp;amp;#39;t necessarily need to be shady in any way, but it&amp;amp;#39;s a really bad look. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/27/dallas-fed-president-kaplan-to-retire-early-on-oct-8-citing-trading-disclosure-distraction.html&quot;&amp;gt;Some people had to leave their positions&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, even though nothing illegal happened, this was a pretty bad look.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Okay, so now they &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/18/fed-approves-rules-banning-its-officials-from-trading-stocks-bonds-and-also-cryptocurrencies.html&quot;&amp;gt;approved rules banning their officials from doing that&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. This is very reasonable. Should it have been done earlier? But, considering things happened already, is there anything better they could have done? I mean... not really? They reacted appropriately. There were no rules, this was bad, now there are rules. No reason to praise them for it, but they did the correct thing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So what does this sub do? You can guess it, &amp;amp;quot;government bad&amp;amp;quot;. Read the replies in &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/swam4i/according_to_a_decision_by_federal_open_market/&quot;&amp;gt;this post&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, or the ones in his even worse post titled &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/swcozf/feds_get_caught_insider_trading_government_says/&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Feds get caught insider trading, government says OOPSIE&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. Let me quote a few: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;This is just stupid&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;This will just make shit worse&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Oh so now they want to prohibit it after all the years they made millions upon millions of dollars.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;In completely unrelated news the average net worth of thr spouses of these employees has gone up 500%&amp;amp;quot; (yes, of course this is prohibited now as well, as you would know if you would actually read any article)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Fuck the government and the feds. They only do shit that benefits themselves.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;They&amp;amp;#39;re all fucking crooks&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Rules are beneath us. - Governments, prolly.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;People, what do you want? This is an example of a government body seing a bad situation and actually improving it. I am not a fan of the US government, but in this case, what tf do you want? Do you not understand the situation at all, or is the only situation you would say something positive about the government if they said &amp;amp;quot;we give everyone 10 BTC!!!&amp;amp;quot;?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Ugh. Sorry for the rant, but this is really ridiculous.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

All physical copies of the seed phrase are destroyed. This money is now mine and no one else&amp;amp;#39;s. I could be stripped of all my possessions, thrown in jail, declared an enemy of the state etc... but as long as I still remember that seed phrase the money is MINE. If that&amp;amp;#39;s not the coolest way to store value in history I don&amp;amp;#39;t know what is. Its like magic.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If anyone is wondering how I did this, I used a memory castle. This is a great thing to learn and not that hard. The core principle is to attach whatever you want to memorize to something in your long term memory. I just used my childhood home growing up. I take each seed word, and create a silly image of that thing in relation to some part of the home I grew up in. Then I can just imagine myself moving around my childhood home, and I see each of the seed words in relation to something I could never forget (The table my parents did taxes on, the entryway to the kitchen, the fireplace I sat next to in the wintertime etc etc.).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cryptocurrency isn&amp;amp;#39;t just a way to get rich. Its an incredibly powerful new technology. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;EDIT: Well guys you were right... I was putting on my pants this morning and fell over due to the weight of my massive balls. I struck my head and now my seed phrase is lost forever. At least they can never take away my massive cock and balls. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Not wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t have affected just Coinbase.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Mr. White hat wasn&amp;amp;#39;t joking when he said this was potentiallytially market nuking.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Coinbase being Coinbase, deemed fit to reward our hacker with $250k, and there wasn&amp;amp;#39;t even any epic item to go with it. 3/10 would not do this quest again lmao.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This also shows a classic human behavior. You&amp;amp;#39;d skim on $50 worth of protection all the time but when you suddenly smash your head on the pavement and be bed ridden for the rest of your life you&amp;amp;#39;re gonna wish you didn&amp;amp;#39;t forget your protective gear. But of course you only appreciate your protective gear when you&amp;amp;#39;re bed ridden.

It was designed to prevent large institutions from being “too big to fail” and being bailed out when economic hardships happen while the common people are left in the cold. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;not&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; meant to eschew laws or take down tyrannical governments. Honestly, having an immutable ledger of where you stole something and sent it to is probably poor form anyways.  It was never intended to be a political revolution either. It was trying to be free of inflation and corruption by a single or a few entities who could determine if transactions are approved with ulterior motives. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For all the people who think crypto entitles you to fund criminals or be criminals yourselves, why? What makes you feel so entitled to these feelings? Have you created your own cryptocurrency?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: didn’t know this was gonna be so controversial. If you wanna do illegal shit with crypto that’s cool, but you also have to be aware that what you’re doing is still illegal and you’re subject to penalty if caught.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/cdr62ff7jqi81.png?width=960&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=f5752413a7cf7e6d0ddfa796b830cfd24f0baa18&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/cdr62ff7jqi81.png?width=960&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=f5752413a7cf7e6d0ddfa796b830cfd24f0baa18&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He&amp;amp;#39;s a legendary investor at Wall Street.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
This man was named the head of the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Magellan Fund&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; at 1977 when he was 33 years old, which had $18 million in assets. He ran it for 13 yearsm, which allowed him to retire at 1990 at the age of 46, when the fund had grown to over $14 &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;billion&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; in assets. The fund annualized return was at  29.2%, more than twice the S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 at that time - which means that he &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;consistently beat&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; the market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After his retirement, this legendary investor switched to philantropy and only managed his own stocks.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So, I&amp;amp;#39;m reading Peter Lynch&amp;amp;#39;s book called &amp;amp;quot;Beating The Street&amp;amp;quot;, where he talks about his investiments strategies, the way he thought during critical momments and the market and so on. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While I was reading, I&amp;amp;#39;ve found this:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/erv8jkzwkqi81.png?width=799&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=fe3ddb1735f46a2236537cf890307cc8b11e9053&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/erv8jkzwkqi81.png?width=799&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=fe3ddb1735f46a2236537cf890307cc8b11e9053&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And then he proceed to argument that in many times that apparently the world would end, the market had some big crashes and then recovered and everyone was fine. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This made me think about the whole situation we are now. I mean, there&amp;amp;#39;s Putin going berserker at Ukraine, Biden saying that Putin certainly will attack it, interest rates going up, COVID has a new variant, truckers at Canada and Trudeau being mad...... basically, we are all gonna die.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Or maybe we are not gonna die and we&amp;amp;#39;ll be fine. We might even be missing some buying opportunities. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To finalize this post, I&amp;amp;#39;d like to quote Peter Lynch again:  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/c7eolmbllqi81.png?width=850&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=585f1db16cf74e02ca9da7ae632be98866d0322e&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/c7eolmbllqi81.png?width=850&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=585f1db16cf74e02ca9da7ae632be98866d0322e&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We will all be fine. Just turn off the TVs and analyze this situation clearly.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Wish you all best and sorry for any english mistakes, its not my first language.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
