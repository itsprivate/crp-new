&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bore off.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We are all here to make money, if you were solely just here for Blockchain technology, you&amp;amp;#39;d be in the Blockchain sub or other technology specific subs. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The only reason I am I to crypto currency is purely because I want to trade the coins profits into my local currency (so I can actually spend it) the only real use case for spending crypto is XMR or BTC on DWMs  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After all this is literally a financial &amp;amp;amp; currency subreddit. Not a technology sub.its nice that the technology is pushing the price, but let&amp;amp;#39;s be honest all we care about is the money we make.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

It&amp;amp;#39;s not backed-up by cash or cash equivalent, it operates as a unregulated money printing machine and the company behind it &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://tokenist.com/tether-didnt-even-show-up-to-cryptos-biggest-regulatory-hearing-yet/&quot;&amp;gt;hasn&amp;amp;#39;t even answered to basic questions&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; from the US Congress, which sounds shady as fuck.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But here&amp;amp;#39;s a good news : &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Tether dominance in the stablecoins market is free-falling&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Exactly a year ago, Tether amounted to about 75% of this market. This ratio has now fallen below 50%, and &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/stablecoins&quot;&amp;gt;currently sits around 48.69%&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. That means that more and more people are using more solid stables, such as USDC, Dai or UST, to buy or sell tokens. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Why is this important for the ecosystem? Because if Tether maintains a high dominance and crashes, as it will inevitably do, most trading pairs will become illiquid, and that would create a panic and a &amp;amp;quot;bank run&amp;amp;quot; from investors trying to cash out their USDT. This scenario wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t be possible with more solid stables, because they have an actual working mechanism for those who want to redeem their deposits.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Let&amp;amp;#39;s make 2022 the year we finally leave Tether behind!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Everyone always hates on memecoins because of how &amp;amp;quot;disgraceful&amp;amp;quot; they are to the crypto game. &amp;amp;quot;Its not a serious project, it doesn&amp;amp;#39;t have a future it&amp;amp;#39;l die out in a couple months...&amp;amp;quot; yeah, I get and partially agree with that, but why does it have to?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As long as it&amp;amp;#39;s not a scam/rugpull, I don&amp;amp;#39;t see why a couple thousand people can&amp;amp;#39;t come together and form a small community out of a token, develop games for it, mint a couple NFT&amp;amp;#39;s, etc...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s not really hirting anybody so I don&amp;amp;#39;t see the problem.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now on the other hand, people that keep pressuring others to FOMO into a cryptocurrency that clearly doesnt have the capacities to become big, but they pretend it does, that is a problem.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

But I don&amp;amp;#39;t care.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Algo is the most shilled coin on reddit. I am the unlucky one and took the bait and bought Algo because of the shill. I did the research and on paper everything looked great. Fast, secure, reliable. I have read a lot of articles, read whitepaper and bought Algo. But now after half a year of holding I have to say that it&amp;amp;#39;s really bad. And I&amp;amp;#39;ll tell you why. Keep in mind that I&amp;amp;#39;m talking about the WHOLE ALGO ECOSYSTEM and not blockchain itself.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Dapps - like currently there are 5 or 6 daapps? This is a joke. Younger chains have hundreds of them but in algo ecosystem there are 5 or 6 dapps and they are working really bad (more about this in the next points. The chain being young is not an excuse because other chains have much more cool and usefull daaps. Algo dapps are using AVM (Algorand wirtual machine) so the adoption will be always slower and slower.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Dapps working like shit. Many of those daaps rely on a single source of truth that is Algoexplorer API. It has constant problems and because of that platforms like yieldly works like shit. November and December was horrible. There wasn&amp;amp;#39;t a single day without any issues.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Official wallet... Sometimes is not working. Or not working correctly. It&amp;amp;#39;s too dependant on Algoexporer api and AWS.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;ALGO is CENTRALIZED&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;No rewards for running own node&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Yesterday the only Algorand DEX tinyman was compromised and hacked and all liquidity pools are gone.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Horrible marketing.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;No clear roadmap for 2022.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Unfulfilled promises (example? about increasing TPS)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A lot small ones like poor website (doesn&amp;amp;#39;t look professional) and poor communication with Algorand Foundation&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The Algorand community on reddit is so toxic and blind. If the Algo price is increasing they are posting charts and yelling how awesome Algo is and the pump is incoming. When it&amp;amp;#39;s down they claim that it&amp;amp;#39;s just because of bitcoin? You get it? Algo UP - it&amp;amp;#39;s because algo is awesome? Algo down - because of bitcoin. They hate every other chain because only ALGORAND is the best. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Poor price action comparing to other scalable solutions. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Ok some of you may disagree with some points but most of them are straigth facts. Please research about the recent Hack and algoexplorer problems.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: Thanks for all rewards!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Because many members are average or terrible investors so  success trigger them. And of course  a lot of scammers too. Everyone else need to lower the bar if  they want to be treated equally and don&amp;amp;#39;t have spam in DMs.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;People are jealous creatures. Sorry to say but crypto, even this sub is full of losers that will downvote your every comment if they will see you as &amp;amp;quot;lucky bastard&amp;amp;quot;. They think more money other people make, less for them. Some people downote everyone for whole month  to earn  literally like 0.00001 moons more so don&amp;amp;#39;t act suprised  top members don&amp;amp;#39;t want to talk about big profits. They gain nothing from it, only risk and problems.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Just check comments under any post  about profits. Main one always is &amp;amp;quot;I don&amp;amp;#39;t have profits&amp;amp;quot;, it is half joke and half sad truth that many people  wants to feel better. Comments about big profits get less upvotes and positive reactions that comments about little or no profits.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also no one would believe someone that tell  about really big profits. If guy that invested $8k into Shiba and earned billions or even &amp;amp;quot;average whale&amp;amp;quot; that have few millions in BTC would came here they would be ignored. Rich people have reddit too, but since it is internet unless they  doxxed themselves they have no chance to prove it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Tl;dr: Most people in this sub do much better than they describe.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These surveys are mostly conducted online and aimed at people who are already interested in Crypto. Meaning that instead of questioning the actual public, we ask ourselves if we like Crypto, and celebrate the outcome of it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Please do not believe any of these statistics, while adoption is growing extremely, not 48% of Americans have bought Crypto in 6 months or consider Crypto replacing their paycheck.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A lot of you don’t believe in the Bitcoin system and that’s fine. You can stay on the sidelines. But if you really want to become wealthy in the future I would suggest you take one frickin dollar, one dollar and buy some Bitcoin and put in a god damn wallet.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now, out of curiosity I can’t help but wonder the obvious question of what would have happened had I put just $1 into Bitcoin or 5 or 20 etc. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;(I could not find the exact price of Bitcoin for May 9th 2013 when he uploaded the video. CoinMarketcap showed me May 5th and 12th and Coingecko showed me May 6th. The price was fluctuating between 110-115. I met in the middle with 113.)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;table&amp;gt;&amp;lt;thead&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/tbody&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/table&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I included $170 because May 9th 2013 was a day after my birthday. I had just turned 18 and gotten my first tattoo for about that price. I did not know anything about Bitcoin but If I could time travel I’d tell my past self “fuck the tattoo, get this magic internet money!” &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Which sounds like a good idea… save money for dips and a little more for any crazy market corrections. After all there isn’t much of a difference between buying Bitcoin at the bottom at 28k and waiting and catching 30k. But often times those people never buy because it never reaches the bottom advertised by TA experts.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The point is don’t get greedy waiting for dips. If you could have bought at 20k (which didn’t happen) or 28k you’d still be significantly up overall. That’s after a 30% market drop. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Nobody knows where the market is heading up/down. Which is why everyone recommends DCA you can’t time the market so spread out your entry points to decrease your odds of getting burnt or buying at the top.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Whatever you do don’t be one of those people that never buys because it doesn’t reach the bottom price that the media advertised.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My initial idea was to create a crypto trading bot in Python, that constantly checks if a new listing is added on Binance, essentially by checking the total number of coins at any given time. I tried out different variations on this, end even increased the speed to buy within 0.1 seconds on a new coin being listed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After looking at the results, and talking to some of you on here, it turns out that the spike in the price upon listing the coin is actually the peak of the iceberg.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The real activity seems to happen once big exchanges announce that they will list the coin, and not upon the listing itself.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Have a look at the chart for FIDA/USDT below, and the time Binance made the announcement:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/i42z3i9dxa981.jpg?width=1536&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=b3bacc1b823f19c9c4f447e31678ebd6c639c648&quot;&amp;gt;FIDAUSDT&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;FIDAUSDT&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/ofhrmxdexa981.jpg?width=677&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=1f8ee28a916d45de9fdd768694b0f0f3291ee439&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/ofhrmxdexa981.jpg?width=677&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=1f8ee28a916d45de9fdd768694b0f0f3291ee439&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Looks like people are fomoing hard into new coins on different exchanges in anticipation of a Binance pump, ironically creating the pump themselves.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So with that in mind, I built a crypto trading algorithm that listens to the Binance announcement page, and once there is an announcement for a new coin listing, the bot extracts the symbol of that coin and places a Buy order on Gate .io.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The tool will automatically place buy and sell orders and it has a trailing stop loss feature, meaning that it should sell at the optimum time, in theory.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I chose gate .io because according to what I&amp;amp;#39;ve seen and what some of you have said, this exchange seem to list many of the coins that later make it on Binance or other bigger exchanges.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The tool is free to use for everyone, but I suggest running it in Test mode at first, as I still need to confirm that everything runs fine. Annoyingly, gate .io doesn&amp;amp;#39;t have a testnet which means I had to test the buy/sell logic by placing real trades - not ideal.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But I&amp;amp;#39;ve included a test mode for the tool itself, so it won&amp;amp;#39;t actually call the gate .io API, it will just simulate the trades locally.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The tool has been tested by me along with a bunch of other people for a while now. I can say that it definitely has potential, and has made profit on numerous occasions, however it is not perfect. Or rather - it can be improved further.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One of the issues we&amp;amp;#39;ve been having is the speed at which the bot will buy the announcement. As you might expect, this needs to happen really fast in order to take advantage of the pump (under 5 seconds in most cases).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It seems that the speed of the bot varies from one listing to another, making consistent profits a bit tricky - but not impossible.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Here&amp;amp;#39;s a video overview of the tool and why it evolved to this:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/SsSgD0v16Kg&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;https://youtu.be/SsSgD0v16Kg&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You also may be familiar with the fact that on January 28, 2021, Robinhood infamously &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/investing/robinhood-backlash-what-you-should-know-about-the-gamestop-stock-controversy/&quot;&amp;gt;restricted the trading of various stocks&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, making positions close-only. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Lastly, anyone who has used the platform for trading cryptocurrency is likely familiar with the &amp;amp;quot;scheduled maintenance&amp;amp;quot; that conveniently obstructs you from making trades at times when the market is making a significant movement. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Still, I know that many people are too complacent for their own good; they will be fully aware of Robinhood&amp;amp;#39;s corruption, but they will use the platform anyways for the commission-free trading. This brings us to our next point...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Are there actually no fees on Robinhood trades?&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Short answer: no.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When you buy cryptocurrency, Robinhood makes money on the artificially wide bid-ask spread. What this means for you is that Robinhood will try to make you pay more when you buy crypto, and try to offer you less when you go to sell your crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Just for demonstrative purposes: lets say you are trying to buy 1 BTC. Robinhood might tell you that the price is $50,000. Then, they will pair you up with someone who is selling 1 BTC for $49,990, and pocket the $10 difference. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Still confused? This analogy may help:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Intentionally quoting a trader a higher price so you can make money on a greater bid-ask spread is akin to shopping mall outlets raising their prices before running a steep “discount” to lure customers.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://coincentral.com/zero-fee-crypto-trading/&quot;&amp;gt;[source]&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So please, even if you aren&amp;amp;#39;t concerned about Robinhood&amp;amp;#39;s trading restrictions and shady management, you should be aware of the way that they profit off of your cryptocurrency trades. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;They still charge you a fee, it is just hidden. Since you know that fees are inevitable, you should choose a more reputable and reliable cryptocurrency broker to do business with.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Was it a memecoin? Was it an airdrop that you forgot about and found years later?How long did you hold it in your portfolio and what made you take profits at the time that you did? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Obviously the folks who have been in for years and years will have a story about buying BTC or ETH at a crazy price. For those people, I’m most interested in what made you take profits at the time that you did? Hopefully it was for something positive and not a case where you needed the money for an emergency. If you didn’t &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;need&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; the money, did you just not want to tempt fate any longer and you already had made a 10-15x?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What allowed you to HODL through the dips and crashes and how did you achieve your conviction in the project? Was it blind optimism? Did you actually DYOR and nobody could convince you that you were wrong? Or was it pure luck and you bought on a whim and it rocketed up so fast you just rode the quick wave, took the money and ran? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Let’s hear it folks!!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yes BTC won&amp;amp;#39;t bring you a 100* nor will ETH but they are a promise of good returns. Heck even if you are chasing some *1000 you should still invest in ETH and BTC because they allow you to hedge your bet. If you lose your crazy risky investment you&amp;amp;#39;d still have ETH and BTC working for you. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I know crypto can give you outrageous returns but we shouldn&amp;amp;#39;t spit on some +50%. I really think, one day, BTC will be 100K usd and ETH will be 10K usd. These are more than solid gains. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Another reason you should invest in these two coins is that they drive the market. When BTC rises the rest of your portfolio rises. Investing in BTC is currently investing in crypto as whole. Reinforcing the market and making all your subsequent bets more secure. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I think you&amp;amp;#39;d have to be a mad person or to be very good at DYORing to not invest in BTC and ETH. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Not financial advice obviously. You do you. Take your risks like adults.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto is much much better. I&amp;amp;#39;m getting double digit interest rates, huge annual return due to Crypto&amp;amp;#39;s value rising PLUS a hedge against inflation. Moreover, there&amp;amp;#39;s no privacy concern and the utility is the same or even more than banks considering Crypto is being accepted more and more as a payment method with better discounts than bank credit cards.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cosmos ecosystem and why it is the most important/undervalued aspect to the crypto space..&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Look into the cosmos ecosystem&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It’s simply fucking beautiful. So beautiful you can’t even fathom it. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Many of the top 15 projects were built off Cosmos SDK! Binance, CRO, LUNA, and many more. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cosmos SDK is one of the best in the crypto space. Tendermint and cosmos are all community driven! No VC’s involved. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Interchain security&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Interchain staking&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;ETH bridge&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Liquid staking&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All coming Q1 2022&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Gas fees? How about no. Decentralized? Yeah we like that shit. Defi? Yeah we have it. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now let’s get into the ecosystem. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Starting off&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;…&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You have Secret &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;SCRT&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://scrt.network/&quot;&amp;gt;https://scrt.network/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Secret Network is the first blockchain with data privacy by default, allowing you to build and use applications that are both permissionless and privacy-preserving. This unique functionality protects users, secures applications, and unlocks hundreds of never-before-possible use cases for Web3.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Tired of companies selling your data for their profit&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yeah so are we. Look no further. This is what will be the most important aspect to web3.0. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Osmosis&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Osmo&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://osmosis.zone/&quot;&amp;gt;https://osmosis.zone/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;First interoperable DEX. I don’t believe anything else needs to be said. Low fees every exchange/swap. Pools with fantastic APY’s. &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;The whole nine yards&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can also look into Cosmos Gravity DEX. Which will also give back all fees accumulated through swaps, back to ATOM stake holders. Fucking beautiful. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Juno&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;JUNO&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://junochain.com/&quot;&amp;gt;https://junochain.com/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The cool thing about Juno besides that it’s interoperable smart contract platform, is that it was directly dropped to the community. 97% straight to atom stakers. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Devs tokens are locked for 12 years. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Juno will also become deflationary over a 12 year span.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Every year inflation is cut in half. “Halving” until no more coins are added to circulating supply. Then it becomes supply and demand similar to BTC.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The max supply is also capped at 185 million. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Juno is an interoperable smart contract network. Highly scalable, robust, secure and easy to deploy!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Many ATOM stakers have received coins through a February snap shot airdrop. All community driven! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Over 150% native apy! &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Defi&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; yes we love it here at the Cosmos ecosystem. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can code with rust and golang. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Whos excited for NETA!&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All of us early adopters will be truly rewarded. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All in all, the cosmos ecosystem is the best out there. Many cannot even fathom it’s future and this is why they don’t really rely on marketing to get their product out there….&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;cough cough&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;cardano&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. (Just a joke) Let the tech speak for itself. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But anyways not trying to throw shade at any project. Just bring light to this gem of a block chain. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Research cosmos and see how powerful the ecosystem is!  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;You can see the whole ecosystem in action through IBC transfers here as well as all other chains in the ecosystem&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; - &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://mapofzones.com/?testnet=false&amp;amp;amp;amp;period=24&amp;amp;amp;amp;tableOrderBy=totalIbcTxs&amp;amp;amp;amp;tableOrderSort=desc&quot;&amp;gt;https://mapofzones.com/?testnet=false&amp;amp;amp;amp;period=24&amp;amp;amp;amp;tableOrderBy=totalIbcTxs&amp;amp;amp;amp;tableOrderSort=desc&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These are just the top 3 in my opinion. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://cosmos.network/&quot;&amp;gt;https://cosmos.network/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One of my favorite quotes is…&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;”Atom is an IQ test”&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Tl;Dr&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cosmos is the most underrated block chain out there. You’re all made up of atoms. Let atom make up you.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hopefully L2 solutions are able to fix that problem or Ethereum 2.0 can by moving to PoS.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The world can just be an absolutely awful, awful place.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I read these &amp;amp;quot;stolen or hacked crypto&amp;amp;quot; posts all the time. I always think, wow that person doesn&amp;amp;#39;t know what they&amp;amp;#39;re doing, shouldn&amp;amp;#39;t be investing in crypto in the first place, or that would never happen to me, because I&amp;amp;#39;m super careful! Maybe they are just lying and trying to just get sympathy? Believe me, I wish I was.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Although, the posts that seem legit I always try to help. Now, I am on the other side of it. Never thought I&amp;amp;#39;d be here.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;ve been investing in digital assets since early 2016. I would consider myself pretty knowledgeable on all things related crypto/blockchain. I believe in the tech, I built my portfolio up for years and this is pretty much the only thing I enjoy in life.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I have a hardware wallet (Ledger Nano S) since 2017 and 4 different Metamask &amp;amp;quot;hot&amp;amp;quot; wallets. The hardware wallet consisted of 80% of my portfolio.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yesterday, I used my Metamask to access all my wallets for a balance status check before the new year. Everything seemed normal. After checking again late last night and after seeing one of my accounts showing as zero, I noticed every wallet was wiped.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My only possible conclusion is that I clicked a malicious link while surfing the internet. The trojan must have somehow took control over my Google Chrome browser (or Metamask extension) while I was using it, while my ledger was unlocked. Checking the transactions times they were sent out around the time I had it open. Again, I never was prompted to accept or approve anything that I myself wasn&amp;amp;#39;t doing. It is frightening.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As I look at all of my wallets today, I see zero balances and I am absolutely crushed. It took all my power to even get out of bed, file reports, and write this post today.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I filed a report with my local county police department and the FBI. Although, I doubt either will be of any help, unfortunately.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Checking the transactions, it seems like the wallets were completed wiped in a matter of minutes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hacker&amp;amp;#39;s ETH address:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;0x365DB2B5722d13F431224066898b4CF8cA7AdFe5&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Address on all chains:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://blockscan.com/address/0x365DB2B5722d13F431224066898b4CF8cA7AdFe5&quot;&amp;gt;https://blockscan.com/address/0x365DB2B5722d13F431224066898b4CF8cA7AdFe5&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m hoping one of the wallets leads to a KYC connection, but obviously a long shot here. Super grateful for any research or help.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some of the crypto that was stolen:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;$ETH $MATIC $AAVE $TIME $OVR $ENS $ZRX $AVAX&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If the hot wallets were all hacked, it would not be the end of the world. I just don&amp;amp;#39;t understand how the hacker accessed my hardware wallet, too. Again, I was never prompted a transaction to approve. My seed phrase is on paper, stored in a safe, which no one has access to. My seed phrase has never been written down anywhere else, no computer, no phone, except on that paper in the safe.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I know since it&amp;amp;#39;s self custody, it&amp;amp;#39;s obviously still my fault. Aside from probably accidently clicking a malicious link on the internet somewhere, I&amp;amp;#39;m still at a complete loss of what I could have done better. A possible solution was to maybe have the hardware wallet on a computer I never touched - one that I never used the internet for, but this is all in hindsight.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;ve been on this computer for years and there&amp;amp;#39;s been a few times when accidently clicking something that starts an auto-download. Obviously, I am always quick to delete or disable those files. Maybe a virus file was lying dormant for months or years without my anti-virus catching it? Just waiting for the right opportunity? Maybe it is a Metamask data leak? I&amp;amp;#39;m not sure. I like to think I&amp;amp;#39;m pretty careful about my passwords and security.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I mainly write this post to warn others. Even if you think you are safe, you might still be at risk. I guess with these advanced hackers now, all it takes is one wrong click. This was my life savings aside from a few emergency funds in my traditional bank. I don&amp;amp;#39;t think I will ever financially, emotionally, or mentally recover from this. It has affected my life and my family tremendously. I hate to sound dramatic and be that guy, but I&amp;amp;#39;m honestly at a point now where life doesn&amp;amp;#39;t even seem worth it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m trying my best to use the last of my energy to fight back.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Any help at all is super, super appreciated and I hope one day to pay you back tenfold (when I can).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thank you.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;---&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TL;DR ledger nano s hardware wallet and Metamask hot wallets were all hacked. Did everything in my power to keep my crypto safe and still lost everything. Most likely from a miss click link -&amp;amp;gt; file download somewhere? Not entirely sure. My life savings gone. I am absolutely crushed beyond belief. Happy new year, this is the worst day of my life.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;---  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;UPDATE: Many have reached out and experienced a similar hack, multiple with hardware wallets too. So many others have messaged to try to help and I can’t thank you all enough. Doing my best to respond while working with exchanges, law enforcement, etc. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I haven’t slept and working around the clock to try to bring justice to this. This is potentially huge and I don’t want others facing the same fate.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Can’t comment on much right now but a computer forensics expert is looking at my computer. Learned so far of a new malware that can hack into many of different crypto wallets. Yes, seems like Ledgers too. Potentially promising.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Compiling a comprehensive report when I can.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
