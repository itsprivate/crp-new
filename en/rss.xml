&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On February 1st 2021, I sent 10,000 USD to Bitfinex to lend out to margin traders, but the funds have not shown up in my account since. I have been in constant contact with Bitfinex support and my personal bank. The former keep giving me opaque excuses as to why my funds have not been credited to my account. Before they ‘couldn’t locate my funds’, now they claim to be able to see the funds but their bank ‘isn’t replying’. They literally couldn’t care less about me and my funds. My bank have exhausted every option to attempt to recover my funds - they say that the receiving bank have been uncooperative. I have a letter from my personal bank confirming that the funds were successfully sent, and I have an ‘official’ letter from Adrian Capron at Deltec Bank &amp;amp;amp; Trust claiming that they have not received my funds (even though Bitfinex have since said they can see the funds).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is a warning to all - &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;stay away from Bitfinex, Tether, Deltec&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. It is also a call for help - does anyone have any suggestions as to how I can rectify this situation? Has this happened to anyone else recently? &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Any cross-community reposts would be greatly appreciated.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; I have seen similar cases where publicity has resulted in a resolution. I will not stop until I have my money back.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Since my funds vanished, I have looked into Bitfinex, Tether, and Deltec, it seems that Bitfinex have previously lost client funds, as their off-shore bank accounts were frozen by authorities for corporate fraud. Apparently Bitfinex kept client funds all in one commingled account. Then ensued cases of clients not being able to withdraw funds - Bitfinex&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/2021.02.17_-_settlement_agreement_-_execution_version.b-t_signed-c2_oag_signed.pdf&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;denied&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;this claim. I knew tether was not fully legit, but I wasn’t aware of really how fraudulent the organisations were.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The &amp;amp;quot;Internet Computer&amp;amp;quot; has been the butt of all jokes in the crypto world. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In an attempt to get back some relevance, now ICP is suing the mother of all thieves - Facebook themselves! Dfinity the parent organisation of ICP has accused Facebook for infringing their copyright logo during Facebook&amp;amp;#39;s rebrand into Meta Platforms.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Dfinity says the US Patents office has granted them registration for the Dfinity logo trademark described as “an infinity symbol with the word ‘DFINITY’ under the symbol”, and as a result of the logo theft, Meta has made substantial sales and profits.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Dfinity is seeking to restrain Facebook from using the logo and &amp;amp;quot;deceiving consumers&amp;amp;quot; with the logo, and further give up all profits Facebook has had due to the new logo. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

If you have been lurking on &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/cc&quot;&amp;gt;r/cc&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; for few months, you would notice how most of this sub loves Algorand. Less than $0.01 transaction fees, seconds of finality and TPS of over thousands, what is there not to like?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The price action. The price action in Algorand has been shit. Part of that has been due to the accelerated vesting that occured once Algo hit its price target last year. Another common complaint that investors have is that Algorand is not focusing on marketing. However, in the past few weeks, we have seen a change from this. First the stunt Algorand Foundation pulled on Earth day. Now Algorand Foundation has partnered with the FIFA organisation for the upcoming men and women worldcup. Hopefully they would continue to take correct steps like this and positive price action would be observed. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyway, bear markets are the best time to accumulate and Algorand is one of the best, if not the best layer 1 solution. They have got lot of things which others are only promising to deliver and this seems like a good time to scoop up some. Not financial advise though and this could all be very risk as Bitcoin could continue to be in a free fall and keep on sucking all Alts dry. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

That&amp;amp;#39;s why now more than ever its crusial to stick to your strategy, make rational decisions and NOT fall for mind tricks and fallacies. And it&amp;amp;#39;s certainly not the time to abandon simple math!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We&amp;amp;#39;ve all heard of sunk cost fallacy, gambler&amp;amp;#39;s fallacy, survivorship bias, confirmation bias and the like.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now after seeing a bunch of bullshit twitter posts, 
I wanted to bring this one to your attention.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;DOT is 70% down from its ATH. Buy now it&amp;amp;#39;s the best risk/reward ratio you&amp;amp;#39;ll get — can go only 30% down.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I don&amp;amp;#39;t have a problem with the DOT-buying part, I have a problem with this reasoning.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;1) No cryptocurrency is guaranteed to return to its all time high. It happened before. It may or may not happen in the future.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;2) There is always equal upside and downside potential. Always. From the moment you invest (even if the asset was one valued 3 times or 50 times more), the dollar value of your investment can go 30%, 70% or 90% up or down. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;So whenever you invest, it is still possible your $100 will turn into $50 or $10.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;3) Twitter and other social media is NOT where you seek financial advice.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyway, I hope you&amp;amp;#39;re doing fine. Buy, sell, do whatever you choose. Just make sure the decisions you make aren&amp;amp;#39;t based on false logic.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is the general summary of the changes:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Instead of eliminating card staking earn rates completely, we will offer a more balanced approach:  8% APY for Private Members (Obsidian, Icy White, and Frosted Rose Gold)  4% APY for Royal Indigo and Jade Green card holders &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now while these are much more appealing than the initial rate changes, my question to those who have already switched platforms or who are considering doing so, is this enough for you to go back to CDC? I feel like they lost the trust of many of their users by springing the extreme changes on them with no prior notice just a few days ago, and I&amp;amp;#39;m not sure this will be enough to avoid a mass exodus away from CDC.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Bitcoin does not care and is undergoing a prime phase of mass adoption with everything from loans to option trading in banks to legal tender.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Especially there is a lot of mass adoption coming from banks. As many mlhave added Bitcoin ans other cryptos to their balance sheet and as an option for traders to invest in. Also we have just seen the first Bitcoin backed loans from Goldman Sachs.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s clear that a lot of mass adoption is happening right now especially from sides that would typically not be that friendly towards crypto. For me personally that is worth more than a 100k Bitcoin. Because what would a 100k Bitcoin help me if the price is not sustainable and there is not actual backing?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But you know what I like more than Hopium? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Knowledge!&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I after reading some comments on this sub I feel like a lot of people could avoid losing money if they simply understood Market cap.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Definition&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, market capitalization (or market cap) is the total value of all the coins that have been mined. It’s calculated by multiplying the number of coins in circulation by the current market price of a single coin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Example&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;If Cryptocurrency A has 400,000 coins in circulation and each coin is worth $1, it’s market cap is $400,000. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;If Cryptocurrency B has 100,000 coins in circulation and each coin is worth $2, it’s market cap is $200,000.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Even though the individual coin price of Cryptocurrency B is higher than Cryptocurrency A, Cryptocurrency A’s overall value is double Cryptocurrency B’s. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Understand that most shillers don&amp;amp;#39;t understand Market cap or are lying to you, look at the example below to see the predictions so called crypto experts are pushing on youtube. (I searched for CRO and took a couple of screen shots)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/5zusgth8n2x81.jpg?width=1284&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=2190bf7f323f3c77ff25cb29154fd7a817961888&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/5zusgth8n2x81.jpg?width=1284&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=2190bf7f323f3c77ff25cb29154fd7a817961888&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can see they are predicting the price of CRO to go anywhere from $10 to $300, is this possible?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;No, its not&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;you can use this website to compare market cap of different coins to get an idea of what a realistic price point is. (&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketcapof.com/&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.marketcapof.com/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/tub8q72co2x81.png?width=888&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=14e2b995e3b5a6377f53fb4bda84f34b7709d799&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/tub8q72co2x81.png?width=888&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=14e2b995e3b5a6377f53fb4bda84f34b7709d799&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/6j0sy92co2x81.png?width=920&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=57dfab5cbdbd61cde6007b0078fad9a7cd9a3e3f&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/6j0sy92co2x81.png?width=920&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=57dfab5cbdbd61cde6007b0078fad9a7cd9a3e3f&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/brffxb2co2x81.png?width=792&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=3c0ed5c4e95ef1de363a2ad3b5d03e139594a411&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/brffxb2co2x81.png?width=792&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=3c0ed5c4e95ef1de363a2ad3b5d03e139594a411&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So even at the market cap of bitcoin CRO would only hit $29.28&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;so no CRO will not hit $300 a coin just because BNB is around $380 and they are both exchanges.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The faster you learn what is realistic the better off you will be.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also avoid crypto youtube, they prey on the gullible and will only cause you to lose more money.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There he called Bitcoin &amp;amp;quot;stupid because it’s very likely to go to zero&amp;amp;quot; and also praised Chinese leader Xi Jinping for banning BTC.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He also claimed that Bitcoin is &amp;amp;quot;evil&amp;amp;quot;. Yet his company Berkshire Hathaway invested $28 billion in Chevron and Occidental Petroleum in just the first 3 months of 2022. The same Chevron that is responsible for one of the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://europeangreens.eu/brussels2013/content/chevron-texaco-and-environmental-disaster-amazon&quot;&amp;gt;worst ecological disasters in history &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;when it dumped over 18.5 billion gallons of toxic water into the Amazon rainforest contaminating two million acres of the Ecuadorian Amazon.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And why did he call BTC evil? For its environmental effects? &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxbusiness.com/business-leaders/charlie-munger-bitcoin-stupid-evil-bad&quot;&amp;gt;Nope&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;it’s evil because it undermines the Federal Reserve System and national currency system, which we desperately need to maintain its integrity and government control and so on&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

He is still very rich, but most of his investments were made decades ago. He have his Coca Cola stock since 1980&amp;amp;#39;s. He can do nothing at this point and he still become richer, simply cause companies he invest into grow whole time. If he would start from 0 today, his investing style wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t be so successful. He would never become rich, cause he invest in safest, most traditional investments. Nothing fancy, cause he believe investments should be least risky ones he can find. Something that will always be necessary and won&amp;amp;#39;t change in long term like fast foods or finances.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Many of us forget his main rule is to never invest in things he doesn&amp;amp;#39;t understand. That is why he missed internet  boom in 1990&amp;amp;#39;s. Later he admitted it was his biggest mistake. Why we treat people like  him as some infalliable prophets in everything? Just cause they are rich and great stock investors doesn&amp;amp;#39;t mean they know everything. Buffet at this point  is  just very old man, born in different era. Before crypto, before internet, and even before mass popularity of TV and planes. He bought his first stock in 1941, during wwII, it was 80 years ago... His past success doesn&amp;amp;#39;t mean he understand modern world anymore.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And come one, would you even bother to try understanding some new technology being bilionaire in his age? I wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t even work, probably would spend my last years on some tropical island doing nothing. Defintely nothing would concern me at this point. It wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t be my problem if crypto will be successful, what wars currently  happen somewhere far away etc.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto is new technology, people that are now 80 or 90 years old: bankers, investors or politicians will die of old age in next maybe 10 years. But we will be left to live with all their mistakes they made. They should have enough dignity  to leave world in hand of young generations. They had their own time, very long time to change world. They failed and they want us to fail too. What they do against crypto won&amp;amp;#39;t harm them today, it will harm us tomorrow. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Did someone already old and filthy rich like Buffet even need to care about crypto? Nope. Crypto succceed or crypto fail he won&amp;amp;#39;t see it anyway. But all those young or middle class aged people that trust and believe him will lose their future thanks to those stupid anti crypto and anti Bitcoins rants of another old, rich man.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But there&amp;amp;#39;s one big problem with each of these altcoins: you can&amp;amp;#39;t fully trust them anymore. Stuff like the recent crypto dot com ordeal, SOL, and the constant rugpulls. It&amp;amp;#39;s becoming more clear that you can&amp;amp;#39;t trust a project. There is always the thought in the back of my mind now that the developers could one day pull a CDC and just fuck over their investors. Neglect the attention ot to cover all their bases. Or just say fuck it and dip out.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The only project I seem to fully trust is Bitcoin now. I&amp;amp;#39;m not worried about the developers deciding, &amp;amp;quot;oh, we&amp;amp;#39;re actually going to make the max supply 100m now instead of 21m.&amp;amp;quot; Everything is set. It&amp;amp;#39;s all Gucci. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Will I only invest in BTC now? Heck nah. I&amp;amp;#39;ll still keep my eyes peeled and sink some beer money into alts. But now I will be extra, extra careful. Chasing gains is over. I&amp;amp;#39;m only interested in things I can trust for now on. CDC taught me a lesson. So thanks for that, I guess.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A new NFT collection was launched on Saturday by the Bored Ape Yacht Club team. The Ethereum blockchain was crushed by the demand.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Bored Ape Yacht Club crashed Ethereum on Saturday night. As part of the upcoming Bored Ape metaverse called Otherside, developers Yuga Labs on Saturday launched a new NFT collection which consists of 100,000 land deeds for the virtual world. Interest in the drop was immense -- too much for the Ethereum blockchain to handle. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Users ended up paying thousands of dollars in fees for failed transactions, and Ethereum proved unusable for hours due to its inability to distribute the load.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How are users ok spending thousands in fees for failed transactions and why are people so hell bent on saying Ethereum is the place to be when launching such products, as the gas prices can at times outweigh the amount you spend on a transaction?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I just don&amp;amp;#39;t understand why there cant be a refund mechanism for failed transactions, especially in circumstances when the blockchain is overloaded by users.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hey Guys,&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Tesla founder Elon Musk’s acquisition of Twitter ought not to have taken anyone by surprise — least of all those of us in the cryptocurrency community. But there may be some ill feeling in the air.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Musk’s dalliance with crypto has seen him in the Twitter spotlight since the crypto market began soaring to all-time highs early last year, and he has remained prolific in his commentary on Bitcoin and other tokens that are now, thanks in large measure to his influence, well known.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He has been sued multiple times by shareholders of his own companies and others — including Twitter — over potentially market-moving tweets, which have been described as “erratic,” among other things.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yet Musk’s purchase of Twitter has now given him a bigger megaphone than ever.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What Musk’s latest acquisition means for the crypto space, however, is moot, although it is abundantly clear that his conduct has alienated many in the community, and he has been accused of treating crypto investors like playthings as the values of their portfolios have undergone wild swings amid the caprice of his Twitter messaging.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This man is truly unstoppable and humanity should be looking forward to his exploration of Mars in 2029. If you ever wondered how Elon Musk would look like if he got attacked by aliens on Mars, there is a good representation of this portrayed by Mutant Musks NFT. I found it quite intriguing as an NFT veteran.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What will Elon do next?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitcoin&amp;amp;#39;s halving cycles are the prime target because they are the main catalyst behind all crypto bull cycles. When bitcoin rallies, fresh capitals flow into crypto, and those seeking higher returns flow from bitcoin into altcoins with emerging narratives. When a bull cycle ends most of these profits then flow back into bitcoin and a fraction of these into fiat and stablecoins. As inflation materialises, it exposes more of the flaws and corrupt nature of central bank controlled fiat currencies. As result the incentive for capitals to jump back in crypto, or stay in crypto altogether by parking in stablecoins, is/will be stronger at the end of the current cycle than it was at the end of any of the earlier cycles where expansionary monetary policy was at an earlier stage. Vis-a-vis increasingly inflationary fiat currencies and never ending expansionary monetary policies, non inflationary cryptos such as bitcoin become a natural hedge against inflation as they allow savers to preserve more of their purchase power.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Less people using fiat currencies undermines the authority of central banks. CBs are the strings through which big private banks and corporations (puppeteers) pull the strings of politicians and policymakers (puppets). To maintain their power and relevance banks will not go down without a fight, and putting up a good fight is what they are doing, especially in the EU. Banks&amp;amp;#39; mission is to strangulate a competitor that generates more value for society, crypto, and for this they have come up with a doctrine on where and how to hit crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;The Ideologue&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The chief ideologue is &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alex-De-Vries&quot;&amp;gt;Alex De Vries&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, an analyst of the central bank of Netherlands and founder of the anti crypto blog &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://digiconomist.net/&quot;&amp;gt;Digiconomist&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. De Vries is also a researcher of the University Vrije of Amsterdam. By going through his research papers on Researchgate, I found out that he has been obsessed with the idea of ending bitcoin&amp;amp;#39;s halving cycles to undermine its profitability for holders and role as inflation hedge. He has re-affirmed it over and over in all possible mediums, not just academic but also in political and financial salons as well as (pseudo) procrypto conferences such as Consensys.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In one of his latest statements, commenting on crypto&amp;amp;#39;s climate footprint debate and the role bitcoin could have in climate change, De Vries has listed the 2 ways in which Europe could contain (capitals flows into) crypto without upsetting the US crypto players, investment funds and corporations that have added crypto to their balance sheets:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Taxation and transaction limits&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Implementing trading restrictions against some cryptos (bitcoin)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Pertaining the first weapon, we are already seeing laws &amp;amp;amp; regulation to kyc unhosted wallets and eventually roll out additional limits that were unthinkable before. This &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2022/04/24/target-the-bitcoin-price-internal-documents-reveal-how-the-eu-could-try-to-ban-bitcoin-and-protect-ethereum/?sh=6efeb9e27201&quot;&amp;gt;Forbes article&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; is also revealing as it discusses pushes from lobbyists to orient policymakers towards measures that discourage activities that could act as a price catalyst for bitcoin by encouraging traders to orient towards ethereum instead. The excuse is, of course, climate change. In reality however the reason is that Ether was always designed to have a limited upside price wise.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Why crypto bull cycles undermine the stability of the Euro (but not the USD)&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As explained in the above paragraphs, Europe is the epicenter of the efforts of anti-crypto strategies meant to discourage adoption and create entry barriers for capitals looking to enter crypto markets. The ultimate objective of the guidelines published by the DNB and CBE is to make crypto less profitable by breaking the halving cycles. If crypto stops being profitable for &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;hodlers,&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; they could still be used as a store of value, as it happens in the US, but without doing too much damage to the euro. It is this principle on which Fabio Panetta&amp;amp;#39;s most recent statement stands:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2022/html/ecb.sp220425%7E6436006db0.en.html&quot;&amp;gt;We should make faster progress if we want to ensure that crypto-assets do not trigger a lawless frenzy of risk-taking.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fabio Panetta is a member of the executive council of the European Central Bank. What Mr Panetta means with &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;lawless frenzy of risk taking&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; is nothing less than price rallies that would allow savers to obtain higher profits by investing in crypto than by investing their savings in traditional investment vehicles controlled by the institution in whose executive board Mr Panetta sits. Obviously, dinosaurs like Mr Panetta that have abused with impunity European savers and the European middle class for decades, are horrified by the prospects of crypto adoption. It is a simple matter of competition not only against crypto, but also against the US dollar. In fact with every bull cycle more capitals flow into crypto and with profit taking most of capitals that originated from euro are then parked into US dollars. The main reason for this is the absence of any euro stablecoins (there are some, but with negligible adoption).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This flight of capitals at every bull cycle is another reason why European banks (spearheaded by the ECB and DNB) are more wary of crypto than their US counterparts. The US Treasury is well aware of this mechanism and the positive effect it has on the US dollar.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;The difference between the US and EU crypto approach&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The influence on crypto markets from the EU and US are different because while in the US we see increasing institutional involvement, in the EU it is the retail market to have expanded most in the past couple of years. US institutional adoption has contributed to minimise crypto volatility mainly through the emergence of institutional investors, that act as long term hodlers. Another mechanism is the fact that having the US become the global crypto mining hub, US miners have more access to capital markets and don&amp;amp;#39;t need to sell their coins on the spot. This displacement of spot markets from Asia into the US has/will stabilise prices further limiting also the upside since crashes are one of the strong catalysts for higher highs. I&amp;amp;#39;ve found &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ar.ca/blog/author/katie-talati&quot;&amp;gt;Katie Talatie&amp;amp;#39;s&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; comments on the impact of US markets on crypto particularly enlightening in this sense.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/n4nq0hbb7ww81.png?width=1274&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=8c26e0b61a453b203e26fd283d95e79c717a45d9&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/n4nq0hbb7ww81.png?width=1274&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=8c26e0b61a453b203e26fd283d95e79c717a45d9&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Talati explains best what she is closest to, the dynamics of US crypto markets. In Europe the situation is different, as shown also in the above chart, retail adoption/activity prevails in European markets. This is why in Europe the optics are different and non inflationary cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are seen as a double threat to the euro, because try also facilitate capital flights into usd. This brings us back to the second weapon proposed by De Vries to limit the impact/competitiveness of crypto against the euro without upsetting US players, that is that of limiting/restricting the trading of bitcoin (the most hated crypto by EU banks). It won&amp;amp;#39;t be long before we see some laws in this regard in EU.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Conclusion&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Every crypto enthusiast, especially in the EU, should be aware of the sophisticated attack orchestrated and executed by the DNB and ECB against crypto. This attack is happening right under everyone&amp;amp;#39;s nose and is aimed at keeping europeans backed in a corner with no choice but to keep their wealth in euros, from where it can be siphoned off/stolen through inflation. It is likely that other regulators around the globe will copy these strategies or become more receptive to them. While I believe that crypto markets will eventually shake them, I think this will be a long war as regulators and banks won&amp;amp;#39;t give up easy. `&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Beware and distance yourself of politicians or political parties that are aligned to these policies.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; This is a fight that has to be fought by today&amp;amp;#39;s population of crypto enthusiasts. We need to keep exposing and educating.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/vjdeu6fc7ww81.png?width=2292&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=40b9032eb90e57fe19f1539d0dc3edb9e0dba23d&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/vjdeu6fc7ww81.png?width=2292&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=40b9032eb90e57fe19f1539d0dc3edb9e0dba23d&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Another attack vector is privacy. As people opt out of the euro, surveillance laws like the proposed last month on unhosted wallets, should become more frequent and more invasive. As many surveys by the European Commission itself have shown however (chart below), privacy is where the efforts to strangulate crypto are more likely to become a political issue because europeans, even those who are not necessarily into crypto today, value privacy more than anything else when it comes to their finances.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;TLDR&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;: The current anti crypto EU regulations are based on a doctrine by Alex De Vries, a DNB analyst and University researcher, who argues that breaking bitcoin&amp;amp;#39;s halving price rally cycles is the most effective way for europeans to undermine crypto adoption. He specifically proposes taxing/limiting crypto transactions and implementing trade restrictions against certain cryptos.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
