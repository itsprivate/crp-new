&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This becomes even more suspicious as LFG and other operators are not releasing evidence of their transactions where they claim they sold coins to market makers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The initial research has been done by blockchain analysis software provider Elipsis, and shows the possible time of the trades and are documented here: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/elliptic/status/1525246959161905153&quot;&amp;gt;https://twitter.com/elliptic/status/1525246959161905153&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The LFG wallets were emptied on 9/10 May, as UST began to collapse - purportedly to to support the UST price&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However today, LFG revealed they sold their holdings as below:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/LFG_org/status/1526126708193054721&quot;&amp;gt;https://twitter.com/LFG_org/status/1526126708193054721&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Transferred 52,189 BTC to trade with a counterparty, net of an excess of 5,313 $BTC that they have returned, for an aggregate 1,515,689,462 UST&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This implies 52189 minus 5313 btc was sold for 1515689462 UST , i.e. the BTC price at the time of sale/loan was : $32334.01&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sold 33,206 BTC for an aggregate 1,164,018,521 UST&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/LFG_org/status/1526126713062576128&quot;&amp;gt;https://twitter.com/LFG_org/status/1526126713062576128&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This gives us a BTC price of $35054.46 per BTC at the time of this transaction!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;LFG apparently used the proceeds of the BTC sale to market buy UST on exchanges in an effort to support its peg. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you look at BTC charts, the price of BTC during 9th to 10th May was around $34200 to $29700 range. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This means those who were on the opposite side of LFG&amp;amp;#39;s BTC sale for UST buys (published by LFG themselves) seemed to have got a much higher conversion rate, than what the UST&amp;amp;#39;s crashing price reflected! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;According to the price of UST on Coinbase, we can see that on 9th, UST ranged from 99.6c to as low as 75c! And on 10th, UST opened at 93c and fell to as low as 62c! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Those who were on the other side of these initial trades were able to redeem their UST almost at a $1 peg, as LFG bought their coins. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Who were at the end of these trades, only LFG and other insiders seem to know. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This whole thing is murky af, and this kind of suspicions is enough to call for an audit of the entire transaction history by a reputed audit firm. Around $40 BN worth assets were burnt to the ground in this mess, it is not a small amount by any means. The Mcap destroyed in this is comparable to the mcap of Lehmann Brothers. Whats worse is that UST mcap was actually dollar denominated debt held by many retail users. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;LFG and all the operators/insiders involved should provide maximum transparency around these trades.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;A police report has been filed yesterday by a Singapore citizen. He claims that he knew of more than 1000 Singaporeans that invested in LUNA and UST. UST was sold as the stablecoin that will remain pegged to $1 but it dropped to $0.1 because the ponzi scam collapsed. LUNA became worthless overnight. A total of $32 Billion dollars is lost.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The remaining amounts to similar Market Makers and CEX associated entities &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Let us be clear Tether and by extension Deltec ( bank for Tether) and Ifinex&amp;amp;#39;s ( owners of Tether) customers arn&amp;amp;#39;t the average joe on the street. It&amp;amp;#39;s the CEX system! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Ifinex through their own exchange Bitfinex showed you could essentially pump liquidity into the market from thin air and benefit from the fees while inflating your valuation. By just &amp;amp;quot;lending&amp;amp;quot; out USDT to the CEX and leveraging to the  tits with the same USDT. Which based of the NY case documents was $600 million of the CEXs own money. They backed the USDT loan with the CEX&amp;amp;#39;s own funds! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So if we are talking about $8 billion being &amp;amp;quot;redeemed&amp;amp;quot; we have to assume it was one of these market makers and or CEXs. Which based on some loans that had USD intrest payments we can then get a clear picture of what&amp;amp;#39;s going on &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Tether gives a loan to a Market Maker of $2 billion USDT. The Market Maker pays the intrest on this loan in USD to DELTEC. This is the source of the 3 -5% cash deposits they hold. The Market Makers then transfer these &amp;amp;quot;loans&amp;amp;quot; to CEXs ( those $1 - $2 billion weekly FTX and Binance transfers we saw)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But you are probably asking where the $2 billion initially came from. Easy it is commercial paper and shares in the CEX that just got the Transfer. The CEX&amp;amp;#39;s value is inflated by the USDT injection that increases the value if its Balance sheet assets ( crypto/ shares) which means Tether has greater &amp;amp;quot;reserves&amp;amp;quot; so they can magically print more USDT &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So logically speaking due to the recent drop in prices and  based off Coinbase&amp;amp;#39;s valuation collapse. We can assume the Tether reserves are in the shit. So they can call in their loans. Which are paid in USDT not USD. Only intrest was in USD &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thus when they burn the loan there is no redemption! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There was never $8 billion&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Note: For legal reasons this is for purely educational purposes and if any  person privides proof of redemptions of the $8 billion. I will delete this post&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;· 80,394 $BTC&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;· 39,914 $BNB&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;· 26,281,671 $USDT&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;· 23,555,590 $USDC&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;· 1,973,554 $AVAX&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;· 1,691,261 $LUNA&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Consistent with its non-profit mission &amp;amp;amp; focus on the health of the Terra ecosystem, beginning on May 8, when the price of $UST began to drop substantially below one dollar, the Foundation began converting this reserve to $UST.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Foundation did so by directly executing on-chain swaps and transferring $BTC to a counterparty to enable them to enter trades with the Foundation in large size &amp;amp;amp; on short notice.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;LFG:
· Directly sold 26,281,671 $USDT &amp;amp;amp; 23,555,590 $USDC for an aggregate 50,200,071 $UST
· Transferred 52,189 $BTC to trade with a counterparty, net of an excess of 5,313 $BTC that they have returned, for an aggregate 1,515,689,462 $UST&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On May 10, when $UST had fallen to $0.75, pursuant to a Master Services Agreement dated January 10, 2022 through which TFL managed &amp;amp;amp; executed all finance, administrative &amp;amp;amp; operational functions &amp;amp;amp; support as requested, &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TFL, on behalf of the Foundation, executed the following exchange trades in a last ditch effort to defend the peg:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As of now, the Foundation’s remaining reserves consist of the following assets:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;· 313 $BTC&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;· 39,914 $BNB&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;· 1,973,554 $AVAX&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;· 1,847,079,725 $UST&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This sub has many posts of people saying goodbye recently and I think these events mark a possible bottom for the market in my opinion. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto fundamentals never changed, bitcoin is still scarce, ethereum is still the biggest smart contract platform,  and the other developments are also the same. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you are a Dev you will probably enjoy this time to build a project and have time to polish it and gather backers and a member base. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

It’s frightening. A top 10 asset, stablecoin at that, has crumbled to zero. People have lost millions in this. Imagine going for a week-long vacation and you’ve come back, your life savings disappeared. I’m really sorry for anyone who’s lost money in this. The last safe haven in crypto, stablecoin, is just as much of a quicksand as the rest of crypto. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Having said that, what happened this week needed to happen. And needed to happen now. The Luna crash is still reverberating in the markets and people are still anxious to put money back into crypto. If a stablecoin could fail, what else would your average person put money into? It’s a scary thought. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But Luna had to crash. Because imagine, if Luna didn’t crash. It was already on a meteoric rise this year. And when the depressed crypto market came back alive, Luna would shoot back up to $100, if not go beyond that. Luna was supposed to be the future of crypto. One of the market leaders. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If Luna didn’t crash now, but instead crashed when it’s gotten as big as Ethereum, at $500 billion, with the fundamental design problems that it has, I don’t know what would happen to crypto. Imagine if Ethereum went to zero tonight. That could potentially kill crypto for a few years, if not set it back a decade in terms of mass adoption. If the crypto market leaders fail, the entire crypto space becomes tainted and shunned. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now that Luna has failed, other algo stablecoins can learn from these mistakes. Create a better project, addressing these fundamental design issues. These are the growing pains that the crypto market needs while it’s still very young. Because ten years from now, these mistakes won’t be as tolerated.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The idea of losing all my Bitcoin really made me feel very uneasy, the solution was obvious, get a hardware wallet.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Any investor that knows how to control these feels needs to have A LOT of will power and patience which obviously gives them an upper hand over other investors.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I myself haven&amp;amp;#39;t been able to master these emotions yet and a big part of this is cause I started out investing in meme coins and shit coins which are VERY panic and FOMO inducing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;See, what I’ve noticed with these calm and collected investors is that the majority of their investments are put into projects which have unique technology and most importantly a ton of development going around which almost always ensures that said projects will make it out of a crash in one piece.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some examples would be Ethereum with tons of technology and real world applications available or projects like Hedera with a ton of development going around now that Hbar Foundation is expanding their ecosystem with more than half a billion in funds allocated just for that.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There are a pretty big handful of projects that fit in this category and learning to invest in them and wait for the long term will help you learn how to control FOMO by not following the hype and will help you control panic by holding on these projects with good long term fundamentals.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Enough nodes are being targeted to cause settlement delays network-wide. Every targetted node is slower in processing, thus everything from block propagation to block confirmation is slower. Additionally, enough bandwidth is being used such that some targeted nodes may be at risk of filling up their disk (unchecked blocks get cleared every 4 hrs and on load — can also be cleared manually).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When the load subsides, the network will recover. The impact of this attack is settlement delays, no funds can be lost. According to my non-voting nodes, the average election duration is around 53 seconds currently (12:27 PM EST).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Developers are aware and have been working and discussing a variety of solutions (some new, some old). This is a good time to remind everyone of a few things:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;• network resilience is not binary (fixed / not fixed) and much more than just dealing with &amp;amp;quot;spam&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;• network resilience has been a focus, is a focus, and will continue to need to be a focus.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;• settlement delays and disruptions are to be expected as this is an experimental network under active development. I recommend being aware of these basics.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s going to take a lot of time and contributions before the network is sufficiently resilient (on a variety of fronts). This is the nature of building an open and distributed network, there are currently a number of known ways a motivated attacker can disrupt (or even take down) the network. The network becomes resilient over time with each newly discovered vulnerability and subsequent contribution of solutions/fixes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Over the years there have been 30+ disclosed ways to take down the Bitcoin network, which is simpler to defend in a number of ways. The nano network is not going to be any different.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Apple makes phones, Spotify gives you music streaming, Chase keeps your money safe, KFC serves you chicken wings, Zoom helps employees communicate, but what the fuck does Solana do for you? Currently valued at 18 billion, but why?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How can my mom benefit from Solana for example? How can a company benefit from Solana? And how is it different from Avalance, Aave, Matic &amp;amp;amp; the hundreds of other projects?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Remember, try to reply to me as if you were talking to a no-coiner, use real world example preferably.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Edit :&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; I&amp;amp;#39;m aware of the very obvious money transfer aspect, which is actually great yes, but there are thousands of cryptos offering exactly that.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I know there are many phone, banks and clothing companies too, but designer clothing doesn&amp;amp;#39;t serve the same consumers as kids clothing, just like with premium phones/cheap android phones or islamic banks/off-shore banks. Variety is necessary, but when it comes to money transfer, you just want it done as cheap and fast as possible.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So what does justify the existence of thousands of projects serving the same purpose (p2p transfers) more than 10 years after the invention of Bitcoin, some with billions in market cap?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Well at the previous Bitcoin halving (May 11 of 2020), we didn&amp;amp;#39;t notice any significant changes in the case of the price, BTC ended the day slightly lower, but according to some bystanders halving was one of the triggers for the major bull run that started 2 months later.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What we do know is that rewards will be halved and prices will therefore have to rise for &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;mining to remain profitable.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Satoshi himself has written in one of his replies that it would make sense for prices to rise.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Tron interview with coindesk about USDD &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/05/14/justin-sun-talks-usdd-stablecoin-in-wake-of-lunaust-unravel/&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/05/14/justin-sun-talks-usdd-stablecoin-in-wake-of-lunaust-unravel/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“I still believe in algorithmic stablecoins,” he told CoinDesk in a Zoom interview, which was scheduled before any of the market turmoil surfaced. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hmmm, so USDD will maintain its peg by a minting/burn process that will convert one USDD to $1 worth of TRX, the native token of the Tron blockchain. And $1 worth of TRX could be burned to mint one USDD. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;SOUND FAMILIAR?  lmao.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;During the bullrun of 2021 this place was so full of scammers, bots, hype and just pure psychosis that anything reasonable or slightly contrary was off the table. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Every second post was a shill coin promising to be the next pump with fake replies and down vote armies at the ready. The swings in profit were so large that even just two days of red candles would ignite insane tribalism.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Ever since the bear market I noticed there&amp;amp;#39;s some balance going on, people aren&amp;amp;#39;t afraid to be honest about the state of the market or even certain projects. Nice to see a little balance, even if only for now.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I wanted to make my own thread of this issue because in the other thread, I did not feel that it compiled enough information in the body of the post to facilitate a healthy discussion of the current situation. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;USDT has lost about 6.6b in market cap since May 11, 2022 (~9% of their market cap). Historically, from what I have seen this has been the biggest drop ever in Tether’s history. So there is good reason to pay attention to it. I am not necessarily saying that a crash is imminent, but it is very alarming.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Historical, along with current data can be found here:
&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/historical-data/&quot;&amp;gt;https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/historical-data/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As we know, Tether is supposed to be backed by 1:1 to the USD by Tether’s reserves. Tether allegedly has fiat, bonds, and other assets to do this (will address this a bit more below). Even though Tether is near its’ peg, the change in market cap shows an overwhelming amount of redemption. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is concerning for a few reasons, for one because the overall market is down. Meaning, the assets in Tether’s reserve also most likely are down as well. I’m not just talking about the crypto market, either. Since we do not have full transparency in Tether’s backing, many have speculated it’s tied to assets like BTC, which is also way down as well. Meaning, their backing “power” may be lower than it was previously and not exactly at 1:1. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As an example, for arguments sake, let’s say that BTC was bought and fully backed the USDT. Their average price for backing was when Bitcoin was at 30k. Now let’s say the market dips, and bitcoin goes to 27k. At the same time, many start redeeming Tether to cash out to fiat out of fear of the market conditions. This means that the backing of Tether is no longer 1:1 and since people are redeeming, Tether would have to sell off its bitcoin reserves for a loss of 10% to cover the redemption. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;From the Cointest competition, we also found out that Tether has also previously lied about their backing: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/22620464/tether-backing-cryptocurrency-stablecoin&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.theverge.com/22620464/tether-backing-cryptocurrency-stablecoin&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; they have also never allowed a public third party audit. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And it was never completely backed by fiat fiat equivalents and treasuries. Instead, it was backed by a mix of fiat and bond equivalents, 50% being Chinese white paper and other unstable assets. It’s closely tied to China’s debt: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://cryptobriefing.com/report-alleges-tether-owns-billions-in-chinese-debt&quot;&amp;gt;https://cryptobriefing.com/report-alleges-tether-owns-billions-in-chinese-debt&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Tl;dr This whole situation is concerning because Tether is supposed to be backed 1:1, but may have potentially have minted more than they have backing for. And due to the magnitude of redemption (that we know from the drastic change in market cap), it’s also causing their backing “power” to be lower and lower due to broader market conditions, such as war, inflation, China lockdowns, etc. Thus also making USDT more unstable.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And I know what most will say, most fiat is exactly the same, however, it doesn’t have nations backing it as a main form of currency and trade. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We have also seen many people on Twitter having a similar sentiment, Daniel Wang, Loopring former CEO and current advisor stated:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Just swapped all my USDT to USDC and DAI.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I would like to thank &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/u/DesignerVirtual9568&quot;&amp;gt;u/DesignerVirtual9568&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; for a lot of this information. I just compiled a lot of the info that I agreed with from their thread.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;EDIT: Just wanted to post this as an update: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/whale_alert/status/1525593170876186624?s=20&amp;amp;amp;t=4oJg1cCkP-cyaUtpmQfxdQ&quot;&amp;gt;https://twitter.com/whale_alert/status/1525593170876186624?s=20&amp;amp;amp;t=4oJg1cCkP-cyaUtpmQfxdQ&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In addition, the market cap for USDT has sunk another 1b since the time of this post&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
