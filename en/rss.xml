&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I contacted many Embassies and they didn&amp;amp;#39;t approve when I applied for political asylum.I have been staying off this Reddit account as the security here is tightening even in small cities where I&amp;amp;#39;m currently in.There are checkpoints literally 10 minutes walk away from each other where they check phones.The military checks our phones for vpn and Facebook and messanger.As for crypto,they are not bright enough to understand it at the moment but they check our phones for Binance(idk why).I put all my funds in a Trust wallet and deleted Binance.A hardware wallet is currently on the way which I bought with the money some of the guys from this subreddit provided.More than 90% of my portfolio currently was contributed by some members of &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/cryptocurrency&quot;&amp;gt;r/cryptocurrency&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.I possess an amount of money($1***) which I couldn&amp;amp;#39;t even imagine I could have,thanks to this sub.When my hardware wallet arrives,I will move all of my funds into it and wait patiently and keep investing hoping that one day I can save enough to take my family out of this hellhole of a country.I will keep using this Reddit account and even if I got out of the country,it would be mainly because of this subreddit.Honestly I couldn&amp;amp;#39;t believe my eyes when some of you guys sent me,an internet stranger they just met,actual money in the form of crypto.Crypto basically changed my life.I&amp;amp;#39;m now using a more secure vpn with a subscription.Thanks members of &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/cryptocurrency&quot;&amp;gt;r/cryptocurrency&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Is this even the right place to post this?Please tell me if it&amp;amp;#39;s not.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Please stay away from these celebrities when it comes to taking financial advices. Kim, Floyd, SouljaBoy and Gunna none of them are your friends they are here just to make a bag by scamming their fanbase.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

This post is for those of you that do.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What is staking? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Staking is a mechanic where you lock up your cryptos and generate passive income as you are helping to secure the blockchain through said mechanic. So you don&amp;amp;#39;t have to do anything and you can generate passive income through staking. This is just like interest in banks but only with much better APY. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Let&amp;amp;#39;s say I have 32 ETH and I am staking them for a 6% APY. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So 32 ETH x 6% = 1.92 ETH&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That gives you 1.92 ETH for free by staking every year. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There are many coins that let you stake. BTC doesn&amp;amp;#39;t let you stake but you can lend it out to generate some passive income. Generally, the APY for staking is around 5% give or take. Some provide more some provide less. If you are HODLing anyway, why not let your crypto make you more crypto. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That&amp;amp;#39;s a win-win.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The thing is, when it comes to addictions, the vast majority of them trigger dopamine, when you do that particular activity. That&amp;amp;#39;s the main reason why you KEEP doing it. This will mess with your thinking, because you are chasing only that.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When you are trading crypto, you will definietly need to get your mind right before making any decisions. 
We all know that good feeling when we see the gains. It triggers dopamine, just like an addiction. Now, I want to say there is nothing wrong with feeling good about the gains. However, unfortunately if you have an addiction (doesn&amp;amp;#39;t matter what kind: drugs, porn, smoking very regularly) you are much more likely to just trade for the feeling of it. 
I experienced this myself.
It&amp;amp;#39;s also dangerous to trade when you are in the process of kicking the addiction!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you can&amp;amp;#39;t get rid of it alone, get help from others and don&amp;amp;#39;t be ashamed of it! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also, if you have porn addiction, feel free to DM me if you want. I&amp;amp;#39;m no professional but I&amp;amp;#39;m ready to help!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is exactly why NFT like Bored Apes are so hated. I think the only valuable thing about Bored Apes is the access to exclusive places and contacts but thats it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Even then, I think this “exclusivity” is REALLY inflated when there are NFTs like Habtoor’s Last Hopium offering almost the same services and exclusivity for much less.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I don’t want to use the word “bubble” cause NFT do in fact have a lot of applications later on. So let’s use the word “inflated”.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

They don&amp;amp;#39;t have wealthy relatives so there&amp;amp;#39;s no large inheritance coming their way and they definitely don&amp;amp;#39;t have the money for a downpayment on a permanent residence of their own.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These individuals know this.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So they put a little money into crypto, hoping to make it grow a bit, hoping to take charge a bit. This is money they&amp;amp;#39;ve already been taxed on. It is a risky endeavor but they&amp;amp;#39;re assuming all the risk. It happens that they grow their $2000 worth of crypto into $5000 worth of crypto and they&amp;amp;#39;re ecstatic! - but here comes the government, it needs a cut.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Why? Why now? Have they not already paid taxes on this money? The government assumed no risk. The money is still in crypto. Those $5000 can turn to $500 in a hurry. What happens then? Can they deduct it? Maybe, it depends on where you live. At best you can deduct only a small percentage of your loss each year.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So, they have to pay taxes on the money they&amp;amp;#39;ve made from the money they had already paid taxes on, even if they still risk losing all of it (+ taxes now).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;--&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If the government must tax crypto gains they had no stake in, make it happen ONLY when the gains go back to fiat or when they&amp;amp;#39;re exchanged into some other real-world asset like a car.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Until then, it is play money, an unrealized gain (or loss) that the government has no business putting their noses in. Poker chips that have not yet been exchanged for cash.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sure, as India did, remove their ability to deduct anything. It&amp;amp;#39;s fine. As long as you don&amp;amp;#39;t try to tax their unrealized gains. Or do something stupid like taxing transactions...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit - I know they only pay taxes on their gains, not their initial.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A lot of people seem to have this understanding that XMR is used solely for the purpose of buying illicit products on the dark web because it’s untraceable, and yes that does happen, but it’s also happened to Bitcoin before and now countries such as El Salvador have made BTC a national currency.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;XMR can be used for so much more then nefarious acts online for example buying everyday products and subscriptions/services.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Why would you want to use XMR for that? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Credit card fraud rose by 44.7% over 2019 to 393,207 reports.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There were 1,108 data breaches in 2020,&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The number of people affected by data breaches was 300Million in 2020 &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;identity theft/fraud cases resulted in losses of $712.4 billion in 2020. That was a 42% increase from 2019.  &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/research/identity-theft-credit-card-fraud-statistics/&quot;&amp;gt;source&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Paying with a credit/debit card seems simple enough but your putting your information/finances at risk of being compromised and it is a headache to deal with compromised bank cards/credentials &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In comes XMR to solve these issues: Since XMR is so private the risk of having your credit/debit card compromised by a data breech is virtually impossible because you never used the credit or debit card to buy the product/service&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Outside entities cannot decipher addresses trading monero, transaction amounts, address balances, or transaction histories. This is all because of XMRs stealth addresses which obscures the public address to the people involved. This also goes hand in hand with XMRs ring signature technology which makes use of your account keys and a number of public keys pulled from the blockchain using a triangular distribution method. There is no way an outside observer can tell which of the possible signers in a signature group belongs to your account. XMR is so private in fact even the IRS has even offered a bounty of $625K to anyone who can crack the privacy of Monero. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://blockchain.news/news/irs-criminal-investigation-$625-000-bounty-monero-privacy-crack-btc-lightning-network-tracker&quot;&amp;gt;source&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On top of all that delicious technology that XMR has to offer it is also an open source and completely decentralized so anyone can partake in using XMR. No one is excluded.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And the icing on the cake is that XMR is considerably much cheaper to transact with then Bitcoin. Plus all the added benefits with all the extra features that XMR has to offer. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Transaction fees paid (last 100 transactions) &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.monero.how/monero-transaction-fees&quot;&amp;gt;source&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Monero (lowest) 0.000007    $ 0.0010&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitcoin (lowest)    0.000027    $ 1.0647&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Monero (median) 0.000009    $ 0.0014&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitcoin (median)    0.000067    $ 2.5851&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Monero (highest)    0.006938    $ 1.0105&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitcoin (highest)   0.000450    $ 17.4929&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;TLDR: you should use XMR wherever possible for your day to day transactions to mitigate your chances of having your credit/debit card and personal information from being compromised.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Privacy is a human right&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The general consensus of this subreddit is always: &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;“DCA and HODL!”&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Yes, the past already proved that it’s one of the best if not the best strategy out there. But do we really need to force this motto everywhere we go?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Shouldn’t we focus more on teaching them what crypto actually solves, how it can literally “change” or “transform” the world that were living it to a better place? One of the biggest benefits that crypto is offering to us, is that there will be no more total control of every aspect in our lives. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If these people will be interested in it, they’ll ask, and that’s time when we, crypto investors can try to direct them to the right way, and show them that crypto isn’t some get rich free quick scheme provided by Tai Lopez. Creating financial freedom from crypto or getting wealthy from it is only side effect.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Just my poor point of view. Have a nice day.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

No international organization is going to make us do anything, anything at all!&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You guys understand that the IMF isn&amp;amp;#39;t just randomly going around demanding stuff, right? Most replies don&amp;amp;#39;t seem to understand that. El Salvador has tried to get &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-el-salvador-economy-exclusive-idUSKBN2AW1GV&quot;&amp;gt;$1.3 billion in funding from them&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; for almost a year now. That&amp;amp;#39;s a ton of money. And sure, edglord Bukele and his corrupt, idiotic government can keep their stance that nobody can &amp;amp;quot;make them&amp;amp;quot; do anything - but nobody is trying to force them to do anything. It&amp;amp;#39;s more of a &amp;amp;quot;yeah we won&amp;amp;#39;t give you money as long as you are gambling with your economy in an irresponsible manner&amp;amp;quot;. Which is a completely reasonable attitude. Why would they just give money to them without conditions?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;El Salvador doesn&amp;amp;#39;t hold any power here. They&amp;amp;#39;re an irrelevant, tiny economy, the IMF couldn&amp;amp;#39;t care less about them. If they want money, they&amp;amp;#39;ll have to comply. Or the dictator once again makes a stupid decision for his country...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

This is the first time the Indian government is discussing crypto taxation. 
The tax will apply to all gains on digital virtual assets, and no capital losses will be allowed. Business expenses will also not  be allowed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Gifts in the form of digital currency will be also taxed in the hands of the receiver.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is a landmark announcement as the first time the Indian government is announcing any law or regulation around crypto. So far nothing concrete was announced except rumors in the media. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now crypto being a taxable asset will lead to growth of adoption of crypto in India&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I propose to provide that any income from transfer of any virtual digital asset shall be taxed at the rate of 30%. No deduction in respect of any expenditure or allowance shall be allowed while computing such income, except cost of acquisition: FM Nirmala Sitharaman&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit : Some sources are saying capital gains losses is not allowed only for offsetting it with other income sources. But it is still allowed within crypto. Waiting for more clarity on this.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit 2: &amp;lt;del&amp;gt;It seems completely no capital losses.&amp;lt;/del&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indiabudget.gov.in/doc/memo.pdf&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.indiabudget.gov.in/doc/memo.pdf&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Law mentions &amp;amp;quot;aggregate income from crypto transfers&amp;amp;quot; - some seem to think this means crypto losses can be offset among crypto itself. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However, no deduction in respect of any expenditure (other than cost of acquisition) or allowance or set off of any loss shall be allowed to the assessee under any provision of the Act while computing income from transfer of such asset&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Further, no set off of any loss arising from transfer of virtual digital asset shall be allowed against any income computed under any other provision of the Act and such loss shall not be allowed to be carried forward to subsequent assessment years.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit 3: Most reaction seem to suggest 30% is really harsh. Especially when long term capital gains from stocks is like 10%. 30% will apply for developers and builders too, which will mean they will move to friendly tax jurisdictions rather than remain in India. Seems like a dumb and self defeating policy tbh.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The law taxes not profits but even transfers. So even simple actions like staking or moving funds or using a smart contract would become taxable. This is insane. Projects that originated in India like Polygon are already moving out, experts say most crypto companies will follow suit as a crypto native company doesn&amp;amp;#39;t want to deal with 30% tax for every transaction they make&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Taxation is at 30% of gains if you are investing. If you are earning 100% of your income through crypto (lots of Indian freelancers/developers are, the tax will be at 30% of total income, which is definitely harsh)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit 4: CEX like WazirX and CoinDCX will now automatically report trades to the tax authorities as TDS. This is similar to other TDS tax deducted at source policies.  So if you are using them the gov will now automatically find out about your trades. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While the tax provisions are definitely bad for Indian users, it creates clarity so now some rich guy with a few millions to spare who was interested in crypto, but waiting on the sidelines wondering if it will be totally prohibited or not can start investing as they know its not prohibited but taxed heavily. Could lead to more Indians getting in (i.e. Le india pamp)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
