&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This was done also in 2018, but it lasted only two months the wage was unpegged and wage plumeted to around 2 USD monthly. Let&amp;amp;#39;s hope this time it stays and keeps going up!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Yes, you are reading it right, monthly minimum wage was 2 USD monthly and now it is around 28 USD!&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also there is a food bonus, paid in cash of 10 USD.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Wages are paid in Bolivares, 28 USD are around 126 Bs. (Bolivares) after goverment removed six zeros by law in Oct2021 (These 126 &amp;amp;quot;current&amp;amp;quot; Bolivares would have been 126,000,000 &amp;amp;quot;old&amp;amp;quot; Bs.)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If the peg is real amount in Bs. should change even if the exchange rate (USD / Bs) changes and PTR should stay around 60 USD.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Average monthly minimum wage is around 89 USD, this is different than 2018 that is why I believe this time it will last more. in 2018 average wage was so much closer to the minimum wage. I mean, people already is over 30 USD monthly. This will benefit mostly public workers and retirees and pensioners  (that have a bonus of the same amount than the monthly minimum wage by law).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;In average a 5 members family needs around 500 USD (this has been increasing lately) to &amp;amp;quot;live&amp;amp;quot; and 1,000 USD to live &amp;amp;quot;ok&amp;amp;quot;. This is according to CENDA (an NGO).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Remember average wage in South America is around 300 USD monthly.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;OCT2021 was the third time zeroes were removed from the currency. First was in 2008 where 3  zeroes were removed, then 5 zeroes in 2018 and now 6 zeroes in 2021.  1&amp;amp;quot;current&amp;amp;quot; Bs. would be 100,000,000,000,000 &amp;amp;quot;pre2008&amp;amp;quot; Bs. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Any question, I&amp;amp;#39;m happy to answer.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

This is forcing average everyday people to use crypto to buy food or whatever. Some are worried this leaves the door open for the gov, but the fact is their budget isn&amp;amp;#39;t in the hundreds, thousands, or even low millions. Their budget is so high in theory it wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t be that hard to figure out what wallets they are using through the ledger.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And since most crypto you can track every transaction through the ledger. In theory, what this means is if the companies/gov that map out the blockchain to figure out who is who. They can figure out who is the Russian gov sending money to, when, and all the other things around that. And from that look into the why and maybe start targeting groups Russia does business with.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For example, there is obviously direct connection between the Russian gov and the Russian Mafia. When you map the wallets out, you can see Russia gov paying the Russian Mafia and blast that info out to the wider world showing this corruption. And it would just take a small bit of investigation to find out why and exacts.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So in theory, this might be worth while for this to be a new norm to help track corruption or other problems.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I am new to crypto and to be fair I’ve only had Binance tell me to go fuck myself because of American sanctions, but this is just messed up. We’ve been blocked out of Binance for 2 years and no one’s said shit, I doubt any of you even knew that we had to pack our shit up and leave, the Russians haven’t even been blocked yet and I’ve seen you people become united as if it were your own accounts.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“Binance owner says blocking innocent Russians accounts is unethical”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“We must stand up for all users”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Are we not innocent? Is it the colour of our skins? What is it? Why are y’all more worried about the &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;idea&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; of it happening to Russians but we’ve been kicked out for years and no one batted an eye?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fair enough, I can use other exchanges like KuCoin. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fuck the Government. Sanctions don’t affect the government, it affects ordinary, innocent people.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And he explained that Bitcoin dodged a big bullet when the block size war happened. If the big blockers had had their ways and changed the base protocol, it would have shown that Bitcoin is controlled by a few and thus weakening the argument that Bitcoin is property and not a security.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So I cannot stress enough that updates are very dangerous and the Bitcoin community was wise enough to avoid hard forks at all costs.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitcoins from 10 years ago can still move using the original protocol.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Saylor went on to say that coins like coin #2 whose monetary policy change every 6 months cannot be considered property and are thus securities. And with that drop mic moment shut the mouths of the interviewers about his opinion on it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

As the industry matures, people will have more reasons to visit different ecosystems, driving more value into cross-chain applications.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In order to access your source blockchain in new ecosystems, you need a reliable way to verify its “state” (a snapshot of account balances and transactions) in the new environment. This trustless infrastructure is currently missing from the market, so people have turned to trusted intermediaries, like centralized bridges and validator networks, to handle their assets. Layer-1 blockchains share a responsibility to reduce this trust threshold in order to protect on-chain value.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Algorand State Proofs (ASPs) are a new interoperability standard that extends trustless interactions beyond a blockchain’s native ecosystem. Through &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/codechain/blockchain-light-client-1171dfa1269a&quot;&amp;gt;light clients&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; (efficient software that tracks blockchain state), they provide a simple, trustless interface to build powerful applications conditioned by multiple blockchains’ events. State Proofs can be implemented on all Proof of Stake chains, and will accelerate our collective path towards true decentralization.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Algorand State Proofs fortify cross-chain applications with Post-Quantum security. By using advanced cryptography, ASPs can withstand attacks by powerful quantum computers that try to alter the reported state of the blockchain, providing a robust, portable source of truth about on-chain data.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;From trustless bridges that move assets across blockchains to decentralized oracles that export valuable on-chain data, people will be able to leverage Algorand’s fast, cheap, and reliable protocol in new ecosystems without trust in an intermediary–they only need to trust the security of the underlying blockchain itself.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Interoperability Problem&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;2021 was an exciting year for the blockchain industry, with a 1,200% growth¹ in the Total Value Locked (TVL) in global DeFi smart contracts, the rise of NFTs, and a diversification across many Layer-1 chains. The promise of a thriving, decentralized blockchain ecosystem is nearly here — yet, most dApps are constrained by the very platform they are built upon.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Blockchain communities are looking for reliable ways to use their favorite dApps without paying expensive gas fees, dealing with network outages, or trusting intermediaries with their valued assets.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Developers want to build on fast and inexpensive blockchains like Algorand, and want immediate access to an expanded user base and liquidity scattered across several ecosystems.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Investors seek exciting opportunities on multiple platforms without switching chains or turning to more centralized alternatives.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;People want to send basic transactions across blockchains in a trustless manner.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Developers, creators, and investors are looking for interoperability solutions that break them out of their walled gardens. ASPs remove these boundaries and open the doors to cross-chain applications and liquidity.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Bridging Solution&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To solve these interoperability problems, many companies have built bridges that move assets across blockchains. These “bridged” assets can be freely used in the target chain’s ecosystem: lent out as collateral for a loan, traded for another asset, or simply held in a wallet.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While bridges show promise, most solutions require people to trust the bridge operator or a set of delegates to store and move their assets in a secure, timely manner. With over $32 billion worth of assets already held in cross-chain bridges (up from $670 million at the start of 2021)², the industry has created a new, centralized attack surface with a large target.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We have an opportunity to eliminate trust from the interoperability equation, creating a new breed of trustless bridges and cross-chain applications that don’t compromise on cost, reliability, or security.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Algorand State Proofs&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Introducing Algorand State Proofs: new blockchain infrastructure that connects Algorand to the broader world. ASPs are an &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://people.csail.mit.edu/nickolai/papers/micali-compactcert-eprint.pdf&quot;&amp;gt;immutable chain of proofs&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; that attest to the state of the Algorand blockchain. They let anyone track Algorand transactions, balances, and application data in low-power environments like a phone, smartwatch, and even inside a blockchain smart contract, without compromising on security — each ASP is produced by the same decentralized network that reaches &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.algorand.com/technology/pure-proof-of-stake&quot;&amp;gt;consensus&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; on new blocks.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Due to their lightweight, portable nature, ASPs can be used to update Algorand light clients in other ecosystems. To lower costs in fee-constrained environments like Ethereum, Algorand will also produce even more compact zk-SNARK proofs that can be used to keep light clients up to date.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Applications like bridges, oracles, and wallets can query these light clients to cryptographically verify Algorand state in a simple, trustless manner. For example, say Alice wants to send Bob 10 AliceCoins from Algorand to Ethereum. AliceCoins are extremely valuable, so they want to make sure the tokens arrive quickly, safely, and without permission from or trust in an intermediary. Alice can send these tokens directly to Bob’s Ethereum wallet via a trustless bridge whose code-base is open to the public.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/99totm7qa7l81.png?width=1400&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=00cdb402e5b39e1072c564816ad169fa54b9e575&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/99totm7qa7l81.png?width=1400&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=00cdb402e5b39e1072c564816ad169fa54b9e575&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Behind the scenes, Alice would “lock” the tokens in the trustless bridge’s &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.algorand.com/smart-contracts-defi&quot;&amp;gt;Algorand smart contract&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, which prevents her from creating duplicate tokens out of thin air. The bridge’s Ethereum smart contract would simply ask the Algorand light client (kept up-to-date by State Proofs) if Alice did, in fact, lock the tokens. Once verified, the bridge would mint and release an equivalent amount on Ethereum to Bob’s chosen wallet.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Similarly, the bridge can trustlessly mint and release bridged Ethereum assets into the Algorand ecosystem using Ethereum light clients. Bridge operators can create Algorand smart contracts that ask these light clients to validate Ethereum transactions (e.g. depositing ETH in an Ethereum smart contract) via Algorand’s &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/algorand/hello-contract-calling-abff8fc00939&quot;&amp;gt;Contract to Contract calls&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. These light client pairs complete the import/export flow for bi-directional bridging.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;The Big Picture&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Algorand State Proofs fortify cross-chain applications with Post-Quantum security. By using advanced cryptography, ASPs can withstand attacks by powerful quantum computers that try to alter the reported state of the blockchain, providing a robust, portable source of truth about on-chain data.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;From trustless bridges that move assets across blockchains to decentralized oracles that export valuable on-chain data, people will be able to leverage Algorand’s fast, cheap, and reliable protocol in new ecosystems without trust in an intermediary–they only need to trust the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.algorand.com/technology/security&quot;&amp;gt;security&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; of the underlying blockchain itself.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Roadmap&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Algorand State Proofs will be available soon, with our first milestone going live this month (March 2022). After next week’s consensus upgrade, the Algorand network will start registering the Post-Quantum secure voting keys used to generate ASPs.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

First she starts tweeting about how regulators need to increase scrutiny of crypto&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://news.bitcoin.com/us-senator-urges-regulators-to-increase-scrutiny-on-crypto-as-it-risks-undermining-sanctions-against-russia/&quot;&amp;gt;https://news.bitcoin.com/us-senator-urges-regulators-to-increase-scrutiny-on-crypto-as-it-risks-undermining-sanctions-against-russia/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As governments worldwide are placing sanctions on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren is worried that cryptocurrency could give Russia a way to evade sanctions. The senator from Massachusetts tweeted Monday:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Cryptocurrencies risk undermining sanctions against Russia, allowing Putin and his cronies to evade economic pain.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“U.S. financial regulators need to take this threat seriously and increase their scrutiny of digital assets,” she added.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then on wednesday she and three other senators write a letter to Janet Yellen of all people telling her to &amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.warren.senate.gov/oversight/letters/senators-warren-warner-brown-reed-express-concerns-to-treasury-regarding-potential-use-of-cryptocurrency-to-evade-sanctions&quot;&amp;gt;enforce sanctions compliance&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot; in the crypto industry &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All of this out of a supposed fear that Putin is going to use crypto to bypass sanctions even though its been known for a while now that Russia has been sanction-proofing itself by building up gold and Chinese Yuan reserves. As well as crypto&amp;amp;#39;s marketcap and volatility making it an unsuitable medium for country-scale transactions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;See why &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://mobile.twitter.com/jchervinsky/status/1498786025438650369&quot;&amp;gt;Russia wont be using crypto to bypass sanctions&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Tired of these politicians pushing their own agendas.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;During last weeks (especially since the Ukraine-Russian war got into the mainstream) I’m seeing more and more comments of people mixing crypto and politics, and I don’t think this benefits the crypto space nor is it necessary.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto has nothing to do with politics, I understand that personalities like Vitalik, CEO’s of exchanges or other famous crypto personalities talk about politics, they have all the right to do so. But we shouldn’t make the mistake to mix crypto with politics.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Safemoon was released on the 2nd March 2021, after core developer &amp;amp;quot;Safemoondev&amp;amp;quot; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://editor.mergely.com/tNAqXd2g/&quot;&amp;gt;copy-pasted the BEE contract line for line, changing the overall tax from 5% to 10%&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Safemoon to this day claim there was a &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;fair launch&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, however in reality, Safemoon launched with zero announcements on March 2nd 2021, where immediately, several wallets purchased hundreds and thousands of dollars worth of a token listed at less than $0.00000000002 (10 zeroes, meaning one hundred bucks would buy you 5 Trillion Tokens &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;This price is correct as of March 5th, I have no earlier price entries&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;). &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Public availability was then on the 8th March, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://currency.com/safemoon-price-prediction&quot;&amp;gt;where the token price had already raised significantly to $0.000000001&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. At this point, new entrants were still getting billions of tokens for relatively small sums, but of course, the people selling got very lucky - these original wallets are widely speculated to be Developers &amp;amp;amp; Friends/Family of developers, with investigation to confirm proof of this currently underway. Whoever bought between March 2nd and March 8th could&amp;amp;#39;ve earned up to 4,900%&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Safemoon enlists the help of several prominent influencers to keep the volume high and price pumping. Names such as Soulja Boy, Jake Paul, etc. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/safemoon-price-plunges-in-response-to-class-action-lawsuit-against-jake-paul-nick-carter-and-souja-boy-202202220843&quot;&amp;gt;There is currently an ongoing Class-Action lawsuit alleging these influencers, and Safemoon dev team pumped and dumped Safemoon&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;An &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://i.redd.it/invnefpcizq61.png&quot;&amp;gt;original roadmap is published&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. This lays out a year&amp;amp;#39;s worth of activity. To this day, most items have been abandoned, or were released months late.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In May 2021, Safemoon reaches the All-Time-High of $0.00001094. If any Pre &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;fair-launch&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; wallets held, they are up 54,699,900%. A $100 investment at the start of launch would therefore yield $54.7m. Currently, the price is &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;-87.27% down from ATH&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.certik.com/projects/safemoon&quot;&amp;gt;The Certik Audit is complete&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and notes several major security flaws. Chief of which;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

In early July, with no wallet in sight, the devs &amp;amp;amp; moderators on the Safemoon subreddit &amp;amp;amp; discord &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;pretend they have a beta wallet to test and claim to have distributed it to 500 people who signed an NDA to keep it secret&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;. It&amp;amp;#39;s now 8 months later and not one person has ever confirmed this wallet existed. At all. No redacted screenshots, no download logs. There is no proof of its existence.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Wallet is now scheduled for end of August. A date has been set. Safemooners are utterly convinced it will bring them legitimacy and respect in the Crypto community. Finally, their first real and tangible product. August 28th rolls round and Billboards appear in London &amp;amp;amp; New York advertising the wallet. CEO John Karony is hyping the launch 10 minutes before it is due to be released at 4pm. 4pm rolls around. No wallet. Nothing. Links to Google Play and iOS store redirect to the homepage. A whale sells trillions upon trillions of tokens 30 minutes before launch, causing a huge cascade of price over the next weeks.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://db70102c-bf65-41f3-abcf-4a0026b2dbdd.filesusr.com/ugd/8fd214_665d75779cd440389a8367fe209e307a.pdf&quot;&amp;gt;An independent company called Doxxlocker audits Safemoon&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. They use the previous flaw stated in the Certik audit as their jumping-off point. They discover that via the very same SwapAndLiquify function, an address did indeed accumulate significant quantities of tokens from the LiquidityPool. Those tokens were then wash-traded and sold on the open market. In total, over $68.4m in BNB &amp;amp;amp; Safemoon were sold.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/l8g6xio5aom71.jpg?width=345&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=19083c375455a7e18fac74415e37b67b53bbea8a&quot;&amp;gt;Three team members simultaneously quit.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; The Chief Operating Officer, Chief Blockchain officer and Chief Technology Officer. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/sq5vlh/this_is_how_the_exsafemoon_coo_lives_after_a/&quot;&amp;gt;Jack is now living a life of abject luxury&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; despite &amp;amp;quot;never owning any Safemoon&amp;amp;quot;. Prior to this, he worked as a part time DJ and twitch streamer. Kay.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/plait6/last_call_for_safemoon_the_curtains_are_drawing/&quot;&amp;gt;The Wallet is finally released&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. It has a non-functioning calculator, and many Safemooners notice it looks strangely familiar. It appears to have been built from the open source code of Trust Wallet. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/54q7q8dde0g71.jpg?width=320&amp;amp;amp;crop=smart&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=dca1610ebffeaeb78b6f08734fa6dc1531a37bc8&quot;&amp;gt;[1]&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/lakkh7dde0g71.jpg?width=320&amp;amp;amp;crop=smart&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=6d5b521e8583ad6d441dc34aaf10cc77d472da44&quot;&amp;gt;[2]&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After several updates, to give them credit, in a short amount of time the wallet was more of less functional. It was missing some features from the Roadmap. &amp;amp;quot;Military-grade&amp;amp;quot; encryption was nowhere to be found... and there was no buy button.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The &amp;amp;quot;direct-buy&amp;amp;quot; functionality finally arrives, brought to Safemooners via Wyre. Now you can buy Safemoon with just a 3.9% fee. That means if you buy 1 million Safemoon, you get 900,000 because of the 10% tax and it costs you 3.9% more. When you sell, you are taxed another 10%, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/YRB3nYo.jpg&quot;&amp;gt;so buying Safemoon direct has a whopping 23.9% tax added on top. &amp;amp;quot;ThE eVOlutION!&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r6utx4/history_repeats_itself_another_highranking/&quot;&amp;gt;Thomas leaves.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; The man they called &amp;amp;quot;Papa&amp;amp;quot;. The &amp;amp;quot;Blockchain Wizard&amp;amp;quot;. He had no proven experience coding a single material thing and helped pepretate a story that he rejected a $2,000,000 job offer from Ripple. Thomas originally handed in his notice, then was convinced to stay. He didn&amp;amp;#39;t last long.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitmart is hacked and 28 Trillion Safemoon tokens are stolen and sold on the open market, crashing the price. Moonboys speculate this is only a good thing, as Bitmart will buy back the tokens at a higher price than the market sells, therefore the price will go up. Two months later, it appears Safemoon CEO John Karony has transferred Bitmart Billions of V2 tokens under the counter, profiting, while Safemoon investors are left holding the shit. They didn&amp;amp;#39;t even get reflections from the transfers.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On Halo Infinite&amp;amp;#39;s release day, investors start to demand updates to Roadmap items. Many things were promised before the end of the year, such as the Blockchain and Exchange. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://i.redd.it/3v4pwgymsk481.jpg&quot;&amp;gt;CEO Karony tells them &amp;amp;quot;Hush, Halo time&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. Not once. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://i.redd.it/bwfzctbyek481.jpg&quot;&amp;gt;Twice.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now it&amp;amp;#39;s time to upgrade the contract! Apparently, the reason there is no Safemoon Blockchain, Safemoon Exchange or major Exchange listings are because this token has too many decimals (quick, nobody mention Shib!) so a reverse-split happens, where Safemoon tokens are traded 1000:1 for Safemoon V2.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The &amp;amp;quot;upgrade&amp;amp;quot; is botched. V2 trades at a higher price, and major arbitrage happens. People sell V2, re-buy V1, trade it for V2 tokens and sell, repeating the process to profit. V2 wallets aren&amp;amp;#39;t receiving reflections properly. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ri4iam/amidst_a_botched_upgrade_943_of_safemoon_holders/&quot;&amp;gt;The community is furious and turns on itself&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Safemoon puts their best minds together and comes up with a plan &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/3lpq6vj3uh881.jpg?width=354&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=c335b14faf664baf24e66a5f2ec34beddc1a9499&quot;&amp;gt;to implement a 100% tax on the V1 token&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, confiscating any funds transacted into the liquidity pool. They signal intention to do this just 1.5 hours before implementing the 100% tax. Many, many, many investors lose thousands and thousands of dollars. Safemoon has not mentioned any plan to reimburse these folks. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://np.reddit.com/r/SafeMoonCase/comments/sztaht/the_wheels_are_in_full_motion_safemoon_class/&quot;&amp;gt;Currently, a second Class-Action lawsuit&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; is brewing because people rightfully feel like Safemoon has stolen their money.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9jSoXYhv8g&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Operation Pheonix&amp;amp;quot; &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;[sic]&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; has been revealed.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; Safemoon is now a &amp;amp;quot;Human-focused technology company&amp;amp;quot; who are spraying Rain-X onto wind turbines built by a third party, in order to generate energy in The Gambia, where a portion of the energy generated will convert into Safemoon. None of the mechanics are clear. The benefits of application of &amp;amp;quot;nanotechnology&amp;amp;quot; &amp;amp;quot;hydrophilic&amp;amp;quot; particles are not clear. How this ties into a Cryptocurrency is not clear. It&amp;amp;#39;s alleged people can have ownership of these wind turbines via an NFT - how that works is not clear. Safemoon community continues to confuse Windmills with Wind Turbines. Windmills mill wheat into flour. That has always been clear.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Safemoon opens their headquarters in Utah. A large office section of a building on a business estate is leased. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/jahvltsfkjk71.png?width=1029&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=00ed93b57be316342f4dff35b05c9e07e7666ce8&quot;&amp;gt;Safemoon claim to have 90 employees&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, but only about 5 of them have ever been seen.   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FIEzAcmWYAEl0vv?format=jpg&amp;amp;amp;name=large&quot;&amp;gt;Advertisements go up in Times Square&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. These play for 15 seconds per hour, every hour of every day, for an entire year. Looking at Advertisement companies in Times Square, one of these billboards would cost between $6-15m dollars for a year. Safemoon has 4 large ones. These billboards have not materially increased the token holders, price or volume.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Mandala exchange, a tiny offshoot of Binance with one of the lowest CEX volume rankings &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://i.redd.it/0sujr5x6i2f81.jpg&quot;&amp;gt;announces they are officially adding Safemoon&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. Mandala does not allow trading in the US. The launch is set for Feb 17th. The 17th Arrives. Mandala releases a statement saying they are having issues implementing Safemoon, but to hang tight. A few days later, they release another statement saying they are having unforeseen issues and &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/qkalxm2nplj81.jpg?width=622&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=d86c46cc03881e880099916a4aa57b60fff598e2&quot;&amp;gt;advise to withdraw all Safemoon deposited onto Mandala&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;3 months after V2 launch, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://bscscan.com/token/0x42981d0bfbAf196529376EE702F2a9Eb9092fcB5&quot;&amp;gt;only 626,000 of the 3 million Safemoon V1 wallets&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; have migrated. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/lnajequunw981.jpg?width=568&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=147320ca26f3d862f6b9eaf61a9d93834c080f9a&quot;&amp;gt;Of the 626,000 wallets, 79% of these holders have less than $600&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s now today, March 2nd 2022. A full year after Safemoon was released. Safemoon teases a month of surprises, and kicks the celebrations off by changing the domain of Safemoon.net website to Safemoon.com, and changing the logo. There are no other changes.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Happy Birthday, Safemoon.&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

I have many friends in Ukraine and I was a business consultant at Skolkovo while I was a student in Moscow.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The overwhelming majority of people using the app to trade in bitcoin are men, making up 79% of users to just 21% women. Compared with the most recent data from the U.K.’s Office for National Statistics, or ONS, this makes the gender divide among bitcoin holders even wider than with other investments.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;So, is it overconfidence?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Barber and Odean found that men trade stocks 45% more frequently than women, which is a symptom of overconfidence because overconfident investors trade excessively&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If we see from that research study that men are, on average, more inclined to be overconfident, that overconfidence could be helping to drive the heavier representation of men in these much more speculative markets. It really takes a bit of a hope and a prayer to believe that these assets are going to be long-term, reliable investment performers.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Users can earn BAT by viewing these ads, and Brave keeps a cut (30%) to run their operations. This process has been steadily regressing, with more and more issues this month and seems to be capitulating.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://community.brave.com/c/brave-rewards/71&quot;&amp;gt;https://community.brave.com/c/brave-rewards/71&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Their community forum is full of people experiencing Brave&amp;amp;#39;s terrible payout system. Basically, Brave tells you you&amp;amp;#39;ll get paid the 5-7th, but that isn&amp;amp;#39;t happening. Your rewards seem to disappear, and then you hope one day you get paid. The Brave Team seems to expect their millions of users to individually PM them to get it resolved on a wallet-by wallet basis, and as you can imagine, they aren&amp;amp;#39;t able to keep up. Now they&amp;amp;#39;re rolling people&amp;amp;#39;s rewards over to the next month, essentially just holding people&amp;amp;#39;s money until they look into it more.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bravebat.info/brave_initiated_bat_purchase&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.bravebat.info/brave_initiated_bat_purchase&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
Brave touts 54 million active monthly users, but has failed to convert those numbers into revenue. The link above shows that for 54MM users, they&amp;amp;#39;ve never done more than $3MM in monthly BAT sales, which they only keep 30% of. This is pennies a month per user, and means that Brave is massively cash flow negative, as they claim hundreds of employees. They have completely failed to effectively monetize their massive user base, and now we&amp;amp;#39;re seeing they&amp;amp;#39;re completely in over their head.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you head over to &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/batproject&quot;&amp;gt;r/batproject&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, you&amp;amp;#39;ll see that the Brave Team has stopped engaging their users, unless they have a very canned response. Their &amp;amp;quot;Director of Engagement&amp;amp;quot; posts very rarely, and they refuse to respond to questions of users. The red flags are adding up, and my guess is that Brave is failing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Investing in BAT I&amp;amp;#39;m realizing is like investing in a private company, and is actually a regressive way to invest. They don&amp;amp;#39;t disclose their runrate, revenue, all revenue sources, executive compensation and many other key metrics that you can see at any publicly traded company. However, Brave touts &amp;amp;quot;transparency&amp;amp;quot; every chance they get, while being about as transparent as milk when it comes to any issues with the payouts.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Perhaps the most damming metric is the 0 growth in ad campaigns in the US. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bravebat.info/brave_ads_campaigns?country=United%20States&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.bravebat.info/brave_ads_campaigns?country=United%20States&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Shows 2 years of flat US ad campaigns, so US advertisers don&amp;amp;#39;t want this. plenty of big names have come through, and very few of run repeat campaigns. If you use the browser, the ads you&amp;amp;#39;ll get now are from very low quality companies, similar to when the browser first started.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I think it&amp;amp;#39;s clear that BAT is failing. Most people on here get maybe a couple of quarters a month, after being told how valuable their data is. Most people think the rewards are a complete joke on here, and I guess they are, and the team&amp;amp;#39;s response is certainly telling of a team in complete disarray. The idea of privacy browser that compensates you for your ad viewing is brilliant, but this team&amp;amp;#39;s execution of that concept ain&amp;amp;#39;t it. It&amp;amp;#39;s been years, they won&amp;amp;#39;t talk about what&amp;amp;#39;s going on, and it&amp;amp;#39;s getting worse. Take a look through that first link, it&amp;amp;#39;s not good.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These issues have gotten worse over the years, and clearly Brave isn&amp;amp;#39;t going to be &amp;amp;quot;transparent&amp;amp;quot; about the problem. I would advise any investors to assume that if the team won&amp;amp;#39;t answer their questions, it&amp;amp;#39;s because the answer is really bad. The Brave Team won&amp;amp;#39;t answer these questions on &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/batproject&quot;&amp;gt;r/batproject&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; - go take a look, they&amp;amp;#39;ve been asked for years, the team will engage and then ghost any question they don&amp;amp;#39;t like.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

In this thread, I will share my experience on the perfect breakdown. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To start, you want at least 70% in BTC. This is the granddaddy of all coins and your most stable. The higher the percentage of BTC, the better.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Next is ETH, I’ve found 60% is a good level. Even if you just have BTC and ETH, you will have 130% of your portfolio in 2 coins, up for 100% you started with. To instantly have 30% more, you are genius. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Next up is the large-cap alts. I like 30% here. You can LRDYOR (let Redditors do your own research) to decide which coin is best for you, but possible examples are SOL, ADA, DOT, LINK, AVAX, etc. Following advice up to this point, you have at least 160% portfolio. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Keeping 20% stables is key to any portfolio. You can earn interest (up to 20%) on stables, plus any price action. I saw one tik-tok’er predict Tether would go to $5 this year. I think that’s bullish, but I can easily see USDT going to $3. Let’s say you earn 20% interest on your 20% investment, you now have 40% (compounding interest works wonders). Now your portfolio allocation is at 200% and you have doubled your money. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now that you have doubled your money, going for 100% portfolio allocation to 200%, you have freedom to gamble on low cap coins. I’d keep this to 10%. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This strategy will work for everyone. It will instantly turn you into a billionaire overnight. Follow me for more financial advice.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
