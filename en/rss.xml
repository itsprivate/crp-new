Even gold tanked and for six long months kept declining alongside stocks.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But then a decoupling happened, after the inital panic where everything got caught up in a global sell off gold reversed and proceeded to rally very strongly for the next 4 years while stocks kept falling. After the initial 6 months of confused panic people woke up and started searching for a safe haven.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Today we are already in a recession but people just dont realise it yet. Stocks have been falling since November last year, some individual stocks down 60%+, the nasdaq down 30% and the S&amp;amp;amp;P500 just today confirming a bear market by falling more than 20%. And just like 2008 gold has been selling off alongside stocks. This time however so too has bitcoin, which just like stocks has been falling since November last year.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;History is repeating.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Over the coming months all economic indicators are going to confirm that the world is in a global recession that started in November last year, and everyone will wake up. They will realise whats going on and start looking for a safe haven. Thats when gold and bitcoin will reverse and enter a strong bull market rally over the next few years while stocks keep falling and indexes languish down 70%+ from their November 2021 highs.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Gold may double or triple in price seeing its market cap rise from $10T to $20T or even $30T. But bitcoin is starting from a much lower $500B market cap and as banks start failing and inflation runs hotter than expected btc will race to equal golds market cap if not exceed it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At a bitcoin market cap of $30T one bitcoin will be worth $1.5 million dollars.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I expect to see gold and bitcoin both decouple from the declining stock market over the next couple of months as a recession is officially confirmed, both beginning a multi-year bull market rally that may last until 2025 taking gold to $5000 per ounce and bitcoin above $1 million.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Most of the 17,000 will disappear. This is the s-curve adoption shakeout we as bitcoiners have been warning about for years. SEC Chair Gary Gensler met with the FTC on Wednesday, and again reiterated that bitcoin is NOT a security, but that &amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Many, I&amp;amp;#39;d say most of the others are securities&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;.&amp;amp;quot; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hodlerforlife/status/1527705100059258880?s=20&amp;amp;amp;t=BVRnn-2FkOVJ37GwM7CtAw&quot;&amp;gt;https://twitter.com/hodlerforlife/status/1527705100059258880?s=20&amp;amp;amp;t=BVRnn-2FkOVJ37GwM7CtAw&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some folks have suggested that getting designated a security won&amp;amp;#39;t affect their coin or protocol. They are terribly mistaken. This designation means you have to follow the established legal framework for securities:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You can&amp;amp;#39;t transfer a security to someone that is not registered to receive securities. If you do, in order to redeem it they must register. Otherwise you can transfer them freely as they are a property, but only to persons or institutions registered. International sales have their own sets of rules.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You cannot issue coins or tokens. This requires form S-3. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Insiders/Devs/DAO&amp;amp;#39;s cannot sell their securities without a form S-4. More importantly, they can no longer trade on material action before the public knows, which is an enormous problem currently, especially amongst exchanges. This is a crime if you are trading securities.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And so on. There is no effort to rewrite American securities laws to accommodate the unique properties of crypto, which instead will meet the burden by complying with the rigor and legal framework everything else does.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/jvu60wzyct091.jpg?width=1074&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=1e38929d5113fe526747b1a7c054527a3c402d0f&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/jvu60wzyct091.jpg?width=1074&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=1e38929d5113fe526747b1a7c054527a3c402d0f&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The coins-tokens-protocols that get designated securities don&amp;amp;#39;t have to comply of course. If they don&amp;amp;#39;t want to change their protocol, register their brass, and create a hierarchical chain of command for reporting, then:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;They&amp;amp;#39;ll be delisted by every centralized exchange within 90 days&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;All their wallets/apps will be deleted from Apple and Google Play&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;No taxpaying company will accept them as payment&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Promoting the ticker or coin in any way will be a crime&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;All major stablecoins will cease to operate within their protocols--and this might be the most insurmountable obstacle, because 85% of ALL altcoin volume is from stablecoins. That means nothing inside an alt protocol has established itself as money--except for stablecoins&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/36jdgpibdt091.jpg?width=1125&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=3b3b04861391c022dd8c7af932637cbdd4d7d8ea&quot;&amp;gt;Web3&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If these projects were decentralized and impairment resistant to begin with, none of this would be happening. They just couldn&amp;amp;#39;t avoid those pre-mines for money though. Their founders loved the spotlight too. If they at least had fixed issuance, they could mitigate some of their problems. But besides BTC, few projects come to mind that can circumvent all these travails; the leading privacy coin certainly can; but even the coin beginning with &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Lite&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; and the one represented by a dog symbol could be in danger of getting this black securities label. If delisted, the only real way to acquire these zombified things would be to take something that isn&amp;amp;#39;t a security (like BTC), transfer it to a DEX, then swap into it. Point is, getting designated a security is effectively a date with gravity from the 50th floor, because you are now in the sandbox with the same rules real public companies, real bonds, and real products must adhere to. Can your vaporware compete? Because if you&amp;amp;#39;re not money, what are you exactly? Nothing. You&amp;amp;#39;re an orgy of swaps, wraps, burns, mints, and stakes run by centralized dapps that do nothing but optimize token interactions to keep the orgy going. Here&amp;amp;#39;s a better way to say this: If your dapp is a centralized registered security with full KYC, why does it need a blockchain exactly? To shill its speculative token. There&amp;amp;#39;s no real business or service there. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Exchanges don&amp;amp;#39;t have profitable business models without a robust (expletive)coin market. Bitcoin isn&amp;amp;#39;t something they can control and the open source tech around it is a race to zero. Add in the fact that BTC has established itself as money, and you&amp;amp;#39;ll see a nascent circular economy already growing around BTC. When it gets big enough (goods services sold in BTC), then exchanges are really no longer necessary. So maybe they&amp;amp;#39;ll spin-off the bitcoin business, miners might acquire them, exchanges might consolidate, who knows. I do know the days of easy money are gone. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/ycsy7yblct091.jpg?width=1884&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=6a30d46068016095e2677e693d4243158fd43a88&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/ycsy7yblct091.jpg?width=1884&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=6a30d46068016095e2677e693d4243158fd43a88&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I think Gary Gensler is a bit naive on what these security designations will do to these protocols that heretofore have been hiding behind the word &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;decentralization&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; and acting like they&amp;amp;#39;re going to do something of value someday. He also doesn&amp;amp;#39;t understand fully what impact it will have on exchanges either. Bitcoiners are smiling of course, because two birds are getting hit with one stone. Centralized bitcoin-only exchanges (and apps) like Block&amp;amp;#39;s CashApp, Strike, Swan, etcetera won&amp;amp;#39;t be burdened with any of this extra paperwork, insurance costs, lawsuits, lawyers, or blockchain forensic add-ons. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My dark maximalism really starts sweating through my shirt thinking about the bloody mess of red ink  we&amp;amp;#39;ll be mopping up though.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Previously cryptos were not accepted as a payment method, but after a man from Florida bought a meal using Bitcoin, that was all people could talk about. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On 22 May 2010, Laszlo Hanyecz, a programmer and BTC miner from Florida, used the crypto to purchase two pizzas from Papa John’s. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;It is the first physical item purchased with the first decentralized digital currency.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/deaz05tzvu091.png?width=798&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=3e537cbd4ec411462bb1a2fb6bdda423a0709293&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/deaz05tzvu091.png?width=798&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=3e537cbd4ec411462bb1a2fb6bdda423a0709293&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Laszlo Hanzecz who spent cryptocurrency (10,000 BTC) now worth over 295,000,000.00 USD on 2 pizzas said he has no regrets.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After the first transaction, Hanyecz would go on to do it many more times and spend a total of 100,000 Bitcoin on pizza that summer - now worth $2,9billion. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;THE NUMBERS ARE GROWING AND SO IS CRYPTO, more than 15,000 establishments worldwide already accept cryptocurrency as payment.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

He also had some(a lot) of UST staked too.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Changpeng now also holds the title for &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Losing the most money in History&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; from $97 billion to  just $11 billion&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;$97 billion  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fast forward to the present.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A combination of inflation, the war in Ukraine, a looming recession and a decimation of the global stock and crypto markets have wreaked havoc on Changpeng Zhao&amp;amp;#39;s personal wealth. As I type this article, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Changpeng Zhao&amp;amp;#39;s net worth&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; has sunk down to…  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;$11 billion  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That means, as of this writing, $87 billion in personal wealth has been evaporated away from CZ in around 130 days.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This has taken a tole on Changpeng and he is now worried about his future and started  a part time job aside from being the CEO of Binance.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Let&amp;amp;#39;s do some meth—umm I meant math!&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There are some important assumptions we need to make. This mini-analysis assumes that:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;UST will be pegged back to around USD $1.00, and&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;LUNA (and Do Kwon) can &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;fully&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; gain investors&amp;amp;#39; trusts, and&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;LUNA tokens won&amp;amp;#39;t be burned significantly to its&amp;amp;#39; supply on March-April when it was trading for more than USD $100 per LUNA (very unlikely, which is why I put this as an assumption).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Goal&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;: we want to calculate the minimum price of LUNA that is needed to get to its&amp;amp;#39; market cap at ATH ($116/LUNA), considering the current supply of LUNA or May 20, 2022&amp;amp;#39;s circulating supply.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Step 1: Recall that Market Cap (in cryptocurrencies) is calculated by the following:&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;MC [$] = Circulating Supply [tokens] * Price per token [$/token]
&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Step 2: We want to calculate LUNA&amp;amp;#39;s circulating supply when it was at ATH.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;2a) According to the data from &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://messari.io&quot;&amp;gt;messari.io&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;... On April 4, 2022: LUNA&amp;amp;#39;s circulating supply was 353 million tokens.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/7sycpgd3qp091.png?width=1296&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=7f32ad9f9f6cabe43f7c8547a2725aec6d6587d6&quot;&amp;gt;April 4, 2022: LUNA was trading at USD $116.43 with 353 million tokens circulating.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;2b) Using the equation from &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Step 1&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, Market Cap (MC) on April 4, 2022 is then the following:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;MC @ April 4 [$] = 353,128,511 * 116.43
&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;2c) Plug it into your favorite calculator and you get:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/bxghece5qp091.png?width=1292&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=89fa01fc3253b68d42bd0dd638d021298e5b13bc&quot;&amp;gt;Market Cap of LUNA at ATH ($116.43/LUNA) on April 4, 2022 = $41,114,752,536&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Step 3: Let&amp;amp;#39;s calculate how much LUNA&amp;amp;#39;s supply jumped by, from April 4 to May 20.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;3a) On May 20, 2022, LUNA went to the moon... in terms of its&amp;amp;#39; circulating supply. It had 6.53 trillion LUNAs circulating.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/4tkomr50rp091.png?width=1236&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=8327e2ffb7df78e92f7b98c77abb5cd0ddbbd18a&quot;&amp;gt;May 20, 2022: LUNA was trading at a fraction of a cent with 6.53 trillion tokens circulating.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;3b) We want to calculate the number of times LUNA&amp;amp;#39;s circulating supply jumped by between May 20 and April 4:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;Number of times LUNA&amp;amp;#39;s supply jumped by = Circulating Supply @ May 20 [tokens] / Circulating Supply @ April 4 [tokens]
&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;3c) Substitute in the variables and the equation becomes...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;Number of times LUNA&amp;amp;#39;s supply jumped by = 6,533,856,234,794 / 353,128,511
&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;3d) Plug them numbers into a calculator and we get:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/nlr76o1erp091.png?width=1582&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=74e925e00129b585bab5fa2e513904fa13a7e641&quot;&amp;gt;Luna has 18,502 times MORE tokens in circulation in May 20 compared to April 4!&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Step 4: Get the answer to our goal — the minimum price per LUNA needed to get to the market cap at ATH, which was when LUNA was about $116 per token.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;4a) Let&amp;amp;#39;s not forget our Market Cap equation back from &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Step 1&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. If we are to translate our &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Goal&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; into a mathematical equation, we&amp;amp;#39;d get the following:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;MC @ April 4 [$] = Circulating Supply @ May 20 [tokens] * Price per LUNA [$/token]
&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;4b) Let&amp;amp;#39;s re-arrange the equation so we can understand the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Goal&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; better:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;Price per LUNA [$/token] = MC @ April 4 [$] / Circulating Supply @ May 20 [tokens]
&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Goal&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;: we want to calculate the minimum price of LUNA that is needed to get to its&amp;amp;#39; market cap at ATH ($116/LUNA), considering the current supply of LUNA or May 20, 2022&amp;amp;#39;s circulating supply.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;4c) In order to use our answer from &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Step 3d&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, we can think of the equation above as this:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;Price per LUNA [$/token] = MC @ April 4 [$] / (Number of times LUNA&amp;amp;#39;s supply jumped by from April 4 to May 20 * Circulating Supply @ April 4 [tokens])
&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Which is&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;Price per LUNA [$/token] = MC @ April 4 [$] / (18,502 * Circulating Supply @ April 4 [tokens])
&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;4d) Plug in the numbers using our answer from &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Step 2c&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; and the information from &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Step 2a&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;Price per LUNA [$/token] = 41,114,752,536 / (18,502 * 353,128,511)
&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;4e) Grab your lovely calculator again...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/kvpkcawesp091.png?width=1582&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=4347df9934c4964b28d640321ab4c397ce717660&quot;&amp;gt;Price per LUNA needed to get to the market cap at ATH on April 4, 2022 = $0.0063/token&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Conclusion&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It won&amp;amp;#39;t even get to $1 per LUNA.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Okay okay, since you insist. Let&amp;amp;#39;s math it again. Suppose LUNA gets to $1 today, that means the market cap of LUNA becomes:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;MC [$] = Circulating Supply of LUNA @ May 20 [tokens] * Price per LUNA [$/token]
&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Plug in the numbers from &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Step 3a&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;MC [$] = 6,533,856,234,794 * 1
&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And you don&amp;amp;#39;t even need a calculator to get:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/3tyg6xinsp091.png?width=1586&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=172937730d5aeb1df8ce646deeaaf86244d3e9ba&quot;&amp;gt;Market Cap of LUNA, if it were to get to $1 per LUNA = $6.53 trillion&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thus, LUNA&amp;amp;#39;s market cap would be much bigger than BTC... &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;and the entire cryptocurrency market cap&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Cheers y&amp;amp;#39;all, have a great rest of the week!🍻&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hello everyone, and welcome to the Tezos ecosystem career fair! We’ve noticed that many people on &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/Cryptocurrency&quot;&amp;gt;r/Cryptocurrency&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; seem to have an interest in getting a job in the cryptocurrency/blockchain industry. However, it can be tough to find an opportunity to join with a job opening that fits your skill set.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We’re here to help.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://tezos.com/&quot;&amp;gt;Tezos&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; is a decentralized public blockchain with a focus on governance, security and evolution. Tezos has attracted a large, organic community of artists and other creatives while also being utilized by big brands and organizations like Manchester United, Red Bull Racing Honda, McLaren, Ubisoft, Cambridge University, and more. Whether it’s related to art and NFTs, DeFi, Gaming, or some other blockchain use-case - there’s probably a Tezos ecosystem team working on it; if there isn’t, then the Tezos foundation also has a grant program to help fund innovative projects: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://tezos.foundation/grants/&quot;&amp;gt;https://tezos.foundation/grants/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Tezos ecosystem has been growing significantly over the past year and there are many teams looking to fill open positions. We’ve compiled a list of some credible organizations within the Tezos ecosystem with many open roles to choose from. These definitely aren’t the only roles available in the ecosystem - but there are many listed here!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;1.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; The existence of exchanges has made Bitcoins core claims completely irrelevant.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;2.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; it is, at best, a toy. in reality it&amp;amp;#39;s a massive disaster. to people who were scammed. to the environment. to victims of ransomware. the list goes on and on. right now a million crypto bros are dreaming up ways to do even more harm. and most damning of all, this is for absolutely nothing. there is no problem that a blockchain can solve that isn&amp;amp;#39;t better solved by something else.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;3.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; You guys ask this shit every day, it gets so god damned old. You guys are so fucking obnoxious I can&amp;amp;#39;t stand you.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;4.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Simply put, crypto is nothing. It offers nothing. provides nothing. it is people speculating on the value of nothing being worth something but in the end it’s.nothing.  if you held a jar of a hobos dick cheese in your hand, you have something more intrinsically valuable than any amount of crypto. at least you have a jar which has its uses. For a bunch of people who think this is the mega game changer, they sure are spending a lot of time online, advertising money, and paid celebrities to try to convince us how amazing it is. Yet I don’t see the mass adoption 13 years later&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;5.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; What interest rate would you charge for a 30 year mortgage lent out in any non-stablecoin of your choice (because at best, stablecoins are only meant to mirror their pegged currency)? If you can&amp;amp;#39;t give me an interest rate that approaches rates used today, then your currency will never (and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;can&amp;amp;#39;t&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; ever) be adopted as a true currency. If you&amp;amp;#39;re just using it to gamble, then gamble away. Just don&amp;amp;#39;t make any allusions about a possible future of actual adoption.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;6.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; There would be no bitcoin in the madman future someone is preparing for. Unfortunately that&amp;amp;#39;s against and old argument for crypto. They keep changing their &amp;amp;#39;purpose&amp;amp;#39; usually it contradicts itself and there is a new &amp;amp;#39;purpose&amp;amp;#39; everyday.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;7.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Volatility makes it useless. If I gave you $100 in BTC and it tanks in a day, I did well and you did not. Or the opposite and it goes up. Someone always loses in the transaction. It’s up and down so much even a few percent in a matter of hours. Sure that’s not a big deal for $20-$50 but it is if we’re talking thousands. My “fiat” doesn’t change that much that quick.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;8.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Because it&amp;amp;#39;s a negative sum Ponzi/pyramid hybrid scheme that has absolutely no real world value.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;9.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; It’s just like fiat cash, only way less secure, far less convenient, and with unbelievable teller fees.It’s a solution in search of a problem.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;10.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; My top argument is Crypto is reinventing what we already have. Fractional reserve banking = stablecoin. Fast transactions (lightning) = Visa. Distributed ledger = database  Exchanges = banks. Carbon converted to CO2 en masse = mining.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Shortly you should see major exchanges rolling it out in the coming weeks.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Litecoin will have now has an optional privacy feature which will allow users to hide their address and crypto amounts when transferring (In addition to other features). This is a game changer for litecoin and a positive for those who like privacy in general, as it&amp;amp;#39;s optional privacy feature allows it to be exchange friendly.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Due to the fact litecoin is available on most exchanges, it will be highly accessible and easy to use it&amp;amp;#39;s privacy features.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In addition to the above, Litecoin will be one of the only coins to have smart contracts, nfts (omnilite upgrade) store of value (only 84 million to exist) brand recognition, has lasted 10 years survived multiple bear markets and to top it all off 100 percent uptime with low transaction fees. Not only that it is accepted everywhere bitcoin is accepted and has a growing not decreasing userbase.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is a historic day for litecoin and privacy advocates. The day MWEB activated.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I would love to think we&amp;amp;#39;re early as we have been 5 years ago today. And I trust my instincts.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Let&amp;amp;#39;s not make the same mistake we did 5 years ago (to think that it&amp;amp;#39;s too late to get in), &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s never too late for anything.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Keep your crypto a secret unless people ask for it. Just go on with your life and do your thing and secretly keep earning that magic internet money we all love so much.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yep, I did it.  I made it.  I lost all my money from this bear market and the Luna crash.  My wife said it was the last straw and left me, divorce papers are in, and I am now free to change my wife.  Just think, someday you could be as lucky as me.
