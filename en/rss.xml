&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The IPO which SEC&amp;amp;#39;s anti-poor hitman Gary Gensler approved... &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You see, as long as you lose money, its all fun and games. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But when the average guys finds a way to make just a little more than what the government allows them to make, they have to be shut down using the entire force of the regulatoooors who want to protect you from earning more than what banks allow you. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The 7% rate offered by Celsius or Blockfi isnt even inflation beating, in the era of &amp;amp;gt; 8% CPI. But you cant earn that unless you are accredited.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;What is, this WSB meets Monero?&amp;amp;quot; you might ask. Yes indeed, and here&amp;amp;#39;s why:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Monero&amp;amp;#39;s obfuscated ledger has enabled a number of  exchanges to misrepresent their reserves, and sell XMR that they don&amp;amp;#39;t actually have, knowing that all too many of us will never withdraw, and no one can see onchain the evidence of their misdeeds.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Well that all changes in 4 days. We&amp;amp;#39;re busy pulling liquidity off exchanges, to force the issue. Already a number of exchanges have frozen XMR withdraws.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Personally I&amp;amp;#39;ve got a little side pot ready to go on the 18th. When the tide goes out, we&amp;amp;#39;ll see which exchanges serve their customers, and which exchanges abuse their customers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hope you join! Check out the xmrtrader and Monero sub&amp;amp;#39;s for more info.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;What would you do with €10,000 euros?&amp;amp;quot; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Of course there were the standard answers like buy a car, go on holiday etc. but in a class of 20 students aged 13-17 there were 3 who said they would buy cryptocurrency, with one naming bitcoin specifically. I was really surprised to see that so I asked them about it after class and I was shocked by their knowledge. I assumed they&amp;amp;#39;d all love SHIB or whatever coin Jake Paul is shilling now but they knew about shitcoins, staking and different exchanges. Obviously they&amp;amp;#39;re all too young to invest at the moment but they said they were always trying to convince their parents to do so on their behalf.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Long story short, it gave me a lot of faith that crypto knowledge and adoption among the younger generation is much higher than I previously thought.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bullish on Gen Z/Alpha/Whatever they&amp;amp;#39;re going by these days.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;People are already getting notices asking to explain their crypto activity, and being asked to submit all evidence including all your bank statements from several past years. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The govt is asking you to explain all your crypto activities and track all your wallets. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These activities are an illegal exercise conducted by the government where the centralised exchanges are playing along, violating the right to privacy of citizens. The law protects people against unauthorised searches and seizures, without any warrant. Users of CEX are not performing any illegal activity, and there is no probable cause to effect seizure of everyone&amp;amp;#39;s data. Yet the CEX have happily turned over people&amp;amp;#39;s data to the government, who is now coming after crypto traders. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is possible that one or two users may engage in illegal activity, but that does not allow the government to seize everyone&amp;amp;#39;s data under suspicion. These are draconian violations of privacy.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At such situations where everyone is just so sad that they can&amp;amp;#39;t even watch the charts anymore or even talk about Crypto. That&amp;amp;#39;s when you know we are truely in some bearish sentiment. But a bearish sentiment is probably the best thing, as the bears become very overconfident that everything is under control but in Crypto nothing every is in anyone&amp;amp;#39;s hands.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also looking at the history the past big bull runs started after everyone was not even thinking about a pump but just about a further dumb. One thing to akwys remember is that a bear run only happens when we can not imagine it going down any day soon and a bulk run happens when we can not imagine it going up any time soon.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I always thought I invested only what I can &amp;amp;#39;afford&amp;amp;#39; to lose. I did not need the money at that time and I was working so I had a steady income as well.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When prices started dropping I realized I was checking the charts quite a lot. It was the last thing I did before going to sleep and the first thing I did when I woke up. The prices going down were nagging at me a lot more than I anticipated at first.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I decided to take out my initial investment and some extra profits if I wanted to go on a vacation with some friends. Since I did that, I barely check the charts anymore and to be honest I feel no stress at all when prices drop.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This made me wonder how many of you their mental health truly stays unaffected by the prices dropping and truly invested only what you can &amp;amp;#39;afford&amp;amp;#39; to lose?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit 1: I’m trying to reply to everyone but damn you all are going hard with the replies!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit 2: I agree “afford” to lose is a really ambiguous and weird term. That’s why I put it between brackets!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

It offers numerous services to cryptocurrency investors and other market players. According to DeFi LIama, the total locked-in value (TVL) in DeFi protocols today is $209.2 billion. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;From lending and borrowing to yield farming, from high APY staking protocols to margin trading, DeFi is ultimately transforming into one of the most desirable, go-to solutions for private investors, institutions, crypto VCs and retailers. With so many new, alternative value propositions being architected on almost a daily basis, DeFi is set to become the quintessential disruptor of 21st century finance. Due to its importance, this post will touch on an aspect of DeFi, which is lending. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cryptocurrency trading and speculation is at the heart of cryptocurrency lending. There is a high demand for cryptocurrency borrowing because hedge funds and a number of investors have found that they can make money by betting leveraged on tokens and crypto derivatives. Because these players can make significant amounts with their trading strategies, they can afford to pay intermediaries high rates for borrowing cryptocurrency. And today often a large number of investors and traders trade their assets in pair to stablecoins like Binance USD, Teather, USD Coin. These payments, net of profits, go to regular crypto investors in the form of returns that far exceed what they would get from bank deposits. Defi lending platforms aim to offer crypto loans in a trustless manner, i.e., without intermediaries. A borrower can directly take a loan through the decentralized platform. Among all of the decentralized applications (DApps), Defi has the highest lending growth rate and is the most prevalent contributor for locking crypto assets. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the past few years, the marketplace has seen even more valuable and innovative decentralized lending platforms. The ability to lend and borrow assets among completely open applications has created a fundamental breakthrough for the future of finance and cryptocurrency.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here are some of the topmost decentralized lending platforms you should know about.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;1. Aave&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is an open-source and one of the most popular Defi lending protocols launched in 2020. It is a non-custodial liquidity protocol for earning interests on deposit and borrowing assets. This platform allows lenders to deposit cryptocurrencies in a pool and receive an equivalent amount of aTokens. Aave algorithmically adjusts interest rates depending on demand and supply. It indicates that the more the user holds aTokens, the better the interest amount.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If users are looking to use the Aave protocol, users first deposit the chosen asset and amount. Shortly after, the lender will earn passive income based on the market borrowing demand. Additionally, depositing assets allows consumers the ability to borrow by using the deposited assets as collateral. The interest you earn by depositing funds may help offset the interest rate users accumulate by borrowing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/ja8uolr5a9t81.png?width=2880&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e7a711330665be2c031cdfd2876b5755ed0cd52b&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/ja8uolr5a9t81.png?width=2880&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e7a711330665be2c031cdfd2876b5755ed0cd52b&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Aave offers users many advantages. Financial protocols boast transparency, and that benefits many users. When it comes to lending and borrowing, everything is clear and straightforward, even for those new to the cryptocurrency market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You don&amp;amp;#39;t have to think about the processes we see in traditional systems that don&amp;amp;#39;t allow access to their processes. They use your funds in a way that benefits them, but they don&amp;amp;#39;t want to share the profits with you. However, Aave exposes your processes to your community so you know everything that&amp;amp;#39;s going on in the network.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some features of Aave:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;1) Aave is an open-source project&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The good thing about open source code is that many people look at it and work tirelessly to keep it free of vulnerabilities.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;2) Variety of credit pools&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can choose from 10 markets, each offering a different APY and a selection of different coins.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;3) Aave does not store cryptocurrencies&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This benefit is great for investors who worry about hackers. Because the protocol uses a &amp;amp;quot;non-storage&amp;amp;quot; approach to its transactions, users are safe. Even if a cybercriminal breaks into the network, he/she cannot steal the cryptocurrency because there is nothing to steal.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;4) Aave protocol is a private&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Like other decentralized protocols, Aave does not require KYC / AML (know your customer and anti-money laundering) filings. The platforms do not work with intermediaries. Thus, all of these processes become unnecessary. Users who keep their privacy above all else can invest in the platform without compromising themselves.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;2. Alchemix&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Alchemix is a DeFi loan-based platform that uses a new method to provide loans that “pay themselves back over time.” Users deposit DAI into a smart contract. In exchange, users receive a token that represents the deposit’s future yield farming potential. The token used through Alchemix is known as alUSD, which can be transmuted for DAI within the Alchemix platform and traded on a given DeFi exchange.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Once funds are deposited, the funds are used to generate income, which will eventually automatically repay the user&amp;amp;#39;s debt . However, there are several ways in which the user can manage their credit:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Option 1: leave their deposit to earn income all the time, allowing them to periodically withdraw the collateral on the loan.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Option 2: Repay the loan early using alUSD or DAI, allowing them to remove the collateral&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Option 3: liquidate their loan using some of their collateral to pay off the loan and allow them to withdraw what&amp;amp;#39;s left.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/ka1tsx87a9t81.png?width=2880&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=a91fd31a92344396486ffa624efbaa5c5c3adff1&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/ka1tsx87a9t81.png?width=2880&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=a91fd31a92344396486ffa624efbaa5c5c3adff1&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;V1 provided users with a single source of income limiting repayment options. Alchemix version 2 is continually expanding the range of yield options available, making it a key lego in the DeFi stack. If a new app comes along that offers competitive returns, we will be able to quickly capture it, which will be mutually beneficial for both us and the protocol we integrate.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In addition, v2 gives users the ability to determine in detail which yield strategies support their loans, allowing them to create their own yield aggregators on top of Alchemix. More conservative investors can choose safer and more stable yield options, while more aggressive investors may prefer to take more risk by choosing other, less established options with highly variable rates.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some Theses and Features of Alchemix Finance: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;1) Alchemix Synthetic Stablecoin (alUSD)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When users deposit DAI into the Alchemix platform, they receive alUSD in return. As per security measures on the platform, there are limits in place on the amount of alUSD that can be minted from DAI assets.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;2) Vaults&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At the heart of the Alchemix Finance protocol are the vaults, operating through smart contracts. At the moment there are 4 vaults with stablecoins. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;3) Pegging mechanism for synthetic tokens&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All harvested yield flows through the Transmuter, which helps maintain a guaranteed redemption of 1:1 for alUSD and DAI. Moreover, users can choose to stake the synthetic stablecoin in the Transmuter, which will automatically convert yield into the base asset (DAI). When staked, alUSD acts like a bond, eventually maturing into a base asset. When users decide to withdraw their converted DAI, the protocol burns an equivalent amount of the Alchemix stablecoin, alUSD.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;4) Alchemix DAO&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Alchemix decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is a community of enthusiasts working collaboratively to grow and develop the Alchemix ecosystem. The DAO also receives funding through the yield generated through the Alchemix protocol, split between the treasury funds. Whereas the treasury fund is responsible for covering the finances of operations, the Alchemix DAO focuses its funding on development. However, any movement of funds is subject to governance from the DAO. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;3. WOWswap&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;WOWswap is a fully community-owned protocol based on a simple idea: liquidity providers can create a liquidity pool, and traders can borrow these funds to buy up to 5 times more tokens. It is built on Ethereum, Solana, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Binance Smart Chain, IoTeX, Polygon and HECO Chain. Protocol fees, interest rates for lenders and borrowers, liquidation ratios and other settings are decided by holders of WOW tokens — our governance token. Making a WOW swap is as easy as making a regular swap on Uniswap or Pancakeswap — extra capital will be automatically borrowed from the liquidity pool.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When a trader opens a leveraged trading position (long or short), the trader takes a loan from the liquidity pool at a current Hourly Interest Rate (HIR). Therefore, to make leveraged trading possible Liquidity Providers (LP) need to maintain enough liquidity in liquidity pools. Anyone can become a liquidity provider by supplying liquidity to the liquidity pools.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/bidfz9v8a9t81.png?width=2880&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=feef161a9900abcaa9690523e824fdc7ba01fc27&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/bidfz9v8a9t81.png?width=2880&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=feef161a9900abcaa9690523e824fdc7ba01fc27&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Into the second half of 2021, WOWswap had already accomplished much of its initial roadmap, including a liquidation bot, instant governance, a recruitment smart contract, enabled leveraged short swaps, and worked out a DAO governance model. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As a way of maximum capitalization of yields, the platform launched an effective yield aggregator that would allow yield farmers to farm rewards on other DeFi protocols. This is because just a handful of pool tokens are active, while over 75% of the rest remain inactive.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For the platform to improve efficiency around the yield aggregator, the platform will take in rewards from more than one protocol. As a matter of fact, the platform favors highly secure protocols as a means of ensuring funds are protected from cyber terrorists. Remember, DeFi protocols have lost around $14 million to hackers within the last year. Hence, security is paramount to any trading protocol.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The development team found it ideal to allow yield farmers to lend a percentage of their dormant assets and reap more rewards. Thereby, boosting the APY from 10% or 15% to 50%. This implies that traders on WOWswap will gain 50% more in APR compared to other leverage trading protocols.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Besides, the protocol also plans to allow users to burn their tokens and gain rewards.  By executing a successful leverage position on the platform, traders will pay a fee that will automatically represent their vote in community governance. While the fees were currently held in the treasury, presently, they are staked to allow for decentralized voting. Meanwhile, the rest of the tokens are distributed to holders of xWOW.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;WOWswap has a number of features and advantages over competitors:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;1) Successful audit by Hacken&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These audit results showed that there were no critical points in the original smart contract they released and highlighted a few more measures that they took to decrease their already low risks to the barest minimum.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;2) Over 200+ coins for making deals &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Lend your coins to traders and receive reward in the form of interest payments of their trades and also you can open long and short positions yourself using leverage up to 5x. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;3) WOWswap Alerts&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;High APY Alerts, that alert WOWswap users when any of the tokens in the lending pool accumulates 20, 50, or 100% profits. This helps get insights on the most profitable pools to lend to.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;4) WOW Governance Model&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Governance is a mechanism, through which holders of WOW-token can change important protocol’s parameters, as well as submit and accept WOW improvement proposals. Everyone, who participates in the Governance, receives Governance rewards, which calculated as a percentage of the protocol’s total revenue.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;5) xWOW token&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;xWOW token is used for voting and Governance reward distribution. Governance rewards are distributed proportionally among all xWOW holders. Staking by itself is sufficient to get Governance rewards, no actual voting is required.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Conclusion&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This detailed discussion shows that DeFi lending has a high potential to reshape the entire financial system. DeFi lending being involved with the intriguing technology truly has vast opportunities to revolutionize the global financial landscape.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is a pretty big deal. It will lead to a huge chunk of bitcoiners moving away from exchanges and just spending their btc whenever they need to.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This would change behaviour immensely by financially incentivising people to move away from treating bitcoin as an investment on an exchnage to actually spending it as money.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s not wholly unexpected as development always tends to run a little later than original estimates, and it&amp;amp;#39;s also not a bad thing that they are going to take their time to make sure everything goes as smoothly as possible.  This is also not FUD, as anyone who is following the progress on tesnet can attest to there have been many major advances towards The Merge in the last several months.  It&amp;amp;#39;s kind of a running theme in the ETH mining community how proof of stake has been &amp;amp;quot;almost here&amp;amp;quot; for years now, but this time it&amp;amp;#39;s actually true we are nearing the end.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I like ETH, think it&amp;amp;#39;s a great project, and am interested in its development.  A lot of casual ETH investors or miners were thinking The Merge might happen in June of this year, and this is the latest information to show that is unlikely to happen.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A bunch of people on Twitter went digging on-chain and found out that there is an insider that has been buying massive positions in these tokens, which have all obviously skyrocketed after the announcement.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is blatant corruption and insider trading. Yet the SEC won’t do shit about this and instead prevents a Bitcoin ETF from existing or bans US residents airdrops. This is why we can’t have nice things.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) increased 1.2 percent in March on a seasonally adjusted basis after rising 0.8 percent in February, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Over the last 12 months, the all items index increased 8.5 percent before seasonal adjustment.   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Increases in the indexes for gasoline, shelter, and food were the largest contributors to the seasonally adjusted all items increase. The gasoline index rose 18.3 percent in March and accounted for over half of the all items monthly increase; other energy component indexes also increased. The food index rose 1.0 percent and the food at home index rose 1.5 percent.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The index for all items less food and energy rose 0.3 percent in March following a 0.5-percent increase the prior month. The shelter index was by far the biggest factor in the increase, with a broad set of other indexes also contributing, including those for airline fares, household furnishings and operations, medical care, and motor vehicle insurance. In contrast, the index for used cars and trucks fell 3.8 percent over the month.    &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The all items index continued to accelerate, rising 8.5 percent for the 12 months ending March, the largest 12-month increase since the period ending December 1981. The all items less food and energy index rose 6.5 percent, the largest 12-month change since the period ending August 1982. The energy index rose 32.0 percent over the last year, and the food index increased 8.8 percent, the largest 12-month increase since the period ending May 1981.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is the chart that should show the Bitcoin price. But if you look there on the X-axis you see how they suddenly switched from years to months. This is just pain in my eyes as a  fellow with mathematic  advanced course in college. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Not only did they completly show a wrong chart but also the year number is wrong with &amp;amp;quot;2121&amp;amp;quot;.  Can someone really fuck up a chart like this and not recheck it? Seems like they intentionally showed it this way to make the viewers feel as if there is no potential growth left in Crypto. Thats just straight up a LIE.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The mainstream media is truely making a complete fool out of themselves. How is someone supposed to trust them for any news, let alone Crypto?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sounds like tomorrow&amp;amp;#39;s CPI reading is going to be painful. I&amp;amp;#39;m having a hard time understanding how &amp;amp;quot;we are in a better place than we were last month&amp;amp;quot; and yet headline inflation is also going to be &amp;amp;quot;extraordinarily elevated.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Full article text:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;by Christian Datoc, White House Reporter  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Biden administration is bracing for inflation to continue its historic rise when the March Consumer Price Index is published Tuesday morning.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters in Monday&amp;amp;#39;s briefing that while &amp;amp;quot;we are in a better place than we were last month,&amp;amp;quot; the administration expects &amp;amp;quot;headline inflation to be extraordinarily elevated due to Putin&amp;amp;#39;s price hike.&amp;amp;quot;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Psaki noted that the previous CPI report did not factor in jumps in energy prices brought about by the war in Ukraine but stressed that the United States is in &amp;amp;quot;a better place than we were last month.&amp;amp;quot;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;We expect a large difference between core and headline inflation, reflecting the global disruptions in energy and food markets,&amp;amp;quot; she continued. &amp;amp;quot;Of course, we know that core inflation, energy, the impact of energy, of course, on oil prices, gas prices — we expect that to continue to reflect what we&amp;amp;#39;ve seen the increases be over the course of this invasion.&amp;amp;quot;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Furthermore, Psaki used the opportunity to push Congress to pass the remainder of President Joe Biden&amp;amp;#39;s economic agenda and &amp;amp;quot;reduce costs for the American people.&amp;amp;quot;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;We have, of course, legislation that could do exactly that and cut the cost of childcare, of healthcare, of elder care,&amp;amp;quot; she stated. &amp;amp;quot;These all have enormous impacts on people&amp;amp;#39;s budgets, on when they&amp;amp;#39;re doing those calculations at their kitchen table, and certainly, this data will be a reminder of the need to do something and take additional steps.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now that we know for sure when it will hit $100k, it&amp;amp;#39;s time to take out a loan whilst being unemployed and FOMO it all into Bitcoin. Not only that, but let&amp;amp;#39;s talk to everyone we know and convince them to FOMO all their money in Bitcoin. What could go wrong, we have the word of experts. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Honestly though, I&amp;amp;#39;m already seeing articles about how Bitcoin will hit $100k by the end of 2022 and it feels like the same thing again that happened last year, namely, people expecting crazy gains because Bitcoin has moved up like 5%. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And this again will cause people invest in Bitcoin and expect to be rich by the end of the year, which is very unlikely, so they&amp;amp;#39;ll definitely be disappointed. I would say that we shouldn&amp;amp;#39;t really care how much Bitcoin will be this week, this month, or even this year. Why look at short term? Not like short term works with Bitcoin, because it&amp;amp;#39;s become a little stable compared to alts, and even they&amp;amp;#39;re not as volatile anymore to get you a lot of profits short term. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitcoin won&amp;amp;#39;t get you rich Short term, it&amp;amp;#39;s best to have patience and invest and wait. No, Waiting doesn&amp;amp;#39;t mean checking the charts every second of the day, simply DCA if you already do or forget about your investment. Patience does pay off.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
