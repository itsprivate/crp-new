&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sadly Sporklin a Dogecoin developer for 7 years loses her &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://cryptopotato.com/dogecoin-developer-sporklin-dies-cancer/&quot;&amp;gt;fight against cancer&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In one of her &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoindev/comments/lpucjw/dogecoin_can_reach_1_with_significant_dev&quot;&amp;gt;last post&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; she is clear on how much involvement/ impact Musk has had.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;‚ÄúElon has nothing to do with Dogecoin which has been made clear repeatedly ‚Ä¶ Elon has come to play with Dogecoin for years on social media, it was only recently that people tried to turn that into something it is not ‚Ä¶ Things have not changed‚Ä¶Elon is not on board with anything, Elon does not have anything to do with the project, the listings, the engagements‚Ä¶Nothing. He memes and trolls.‚Äù&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;May 2021&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On Twitter Elon the now dubbed Dogefather announced : &amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1392974251011895300?s=20&amp;amp;amp;t=vILjxrPe0-pgjeaeWucMiw&quot;&amp;gt;Working with Doge devs to improve system transaction efficiency. Potentially promising.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot; ... the price of Doge surged. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In a now deleted tweet Dogecoin co-founder Jackson Palmer cautioned followers saying..  &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Reminder: Elon Musk is and always will be a self-absorbed grifter.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Nov 21&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Last Dogecoin GitHub Master branch &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/commits/master&quot;&amp;gt;commit&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; was over 7 months.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Although still signs of some life &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/branches&quot;&amp;gt;on dev branches&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Last release, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoindev/comments/qpkk46/dogecoin_core_1145_released/&quot;&amp;gt;6 months ago...&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Jan 22&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In a long awaited Dogecoin announcement, the headline says Tesla  &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/tesla-accepts-dogecoin-for-merchandise-5216067&quot;&amp;gt;accepts Dogecoin&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; but the reality says its only for certain items in its shop like a belt buck and Tesla shaped whistle. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Feb 2022&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Core developer Ross Nicoll &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://rnicoll.name/posts/2022-02-16-stepping-away/&quot;&amp;gt;steps away&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; from the project referring to stress, a potential lawsuit against the developers and lack of funds the foundation has to pay him anything at all despite the Billionaire supposingly having Devs back. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Apr 2022&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In a &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/michilumin/status/1517958353024020480?s=20&amp;amp;amp;t=_9ZUgcvPqct44NLcE4qKMQ&quot;&amp;gt;Twitter thread&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; another Dogecoin developer Michi Lumin again paints a picture of an underfunded foundation....&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;When influencers say that the Foundation has tons of funding lined up, or that we&amp;amp;#39;re building out infrastructure - and people believe that - it actually harms the @DogecoinFdn because people who would otherwise be willing to help go &amp;amp;quot;oh, they have it all taken care of&amp;amp;quot;, This bothers me because we&amp;amp;#39;re not actually a club full of rich people. Many of us still work day jobs to make ends meet but still want to see #dogecoin proceed and succeed. Tales of palace intrigue end up being things we have to spend time answering to, as well...and the propensity for certain sections of the community and media to be thirsty for the next scandal or conspiracy actually puts a lot of strain on an already fairly stressed crew.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Yes, we&amp;amp;#39;re trying to get sustaining funding in order to do some of the &amp;amp;#39;big ideas&amp;amp;#39; we want to pursue. A lot of what you read on social media in regard to this is completely made up for clicks and engagement-We still have a lot of hard work to do. Wish ppl wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t make it harder.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On the whole after over a year there has been no dramatic revelation or support for &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://gitgitlog.com/dogecoin&quot;&amp;gt;Dogecoin development&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.. think it&amp;amp;#39;s safe to deduce that once again.... Elon Musk is most likely Twitters biggest spam bot üí©&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://np.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/uvz90h/to_the_rbitcoiners_that_keep_coming_to_this_sub/&quot;&amp;gt;https://np.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/uvz90h/to_the_rbitcoiners_that_keep_coming_to_this_sub/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;(Please, remember Reddit&amp;amp;#39;s rules, and don&amp;amp;#39;t go brigade it).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;ll cover each point here, objectively and rationally.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;1.No Intrinsic Value: You can tell whether or not something has  ‚Äúintrinsic value‚Äù, by seeing where it fits in Maslow‚Äôs Hierarchy of  Needs.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Intrinsic value is always a tricky one, since there is no clear cut definition of &amp;amp;quot;intrinsic value&amp;amp;quot;. I always thought when it comes to tech, value comes from the problems it can solve. So software can have intrinsic value.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But going by OP&amp;amp;#39;s definition about intrinsic value having to do with filling our basic needs, of acquiring food shelter etc...Isn&amp;amp;#39;t that what money does? It pays for those things?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And crypto is money, and arguably, the way money should have been done from the beginning.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Even in Mesopotamia, they realized coins, seashells, gold, wasn&amp;amp;#39;t what money was really about. It&amp;amp;#39;s really about the ledger.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Keeping track of how money interacts, and who has what. All in one efficient place.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They started using tablets to keep track of transactions, who owed what, how much, etc... It was the ancestor to banking.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/atmcpvjvag191.jpg?width=522&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=bb3fc540b94e5d71e3f9f0ec4634088bcc38c88f&quot;&amp;gt;Ancestor to the blockchain: 5,000 years ago, the Mesopotamian ledger created an indisputable record of transactions, instead of using money.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Today, our money has really become all digital, and about the ledger again.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s a computer accounting system.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When we transfer money from our HSBC account to our credit card, then to the vendor on Amazon who sold us our lube, it&amp;amp;#39;s all electronic and on a ledger.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;HSBC doesn&amp;amp;#39;t send a truck of cash to Amazon.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But that system is still inefficient, has too many parties and different companies involved in the process. With too many weak links. Poor security. Too many IOUs instead of real transactions. And having so many different elements you have to trust. Along with the employees in each company.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My credit card number is going through so many hands.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is where crypto comes in. It takes out all the weak links, that complicated inefficient system, and most of all, removes the issue of always having to trust so many people.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The only thing between my money, and the guy who sells me lube, is a blockchain controlled by a decentralized consensus, and cryptography.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Seem like the system we were meant to have since the days of Mesopotamia, but didn&amp;amp;#39;t have the technology yet.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At the end of the day, you can make the argument for both intrinsic and non-intrinsic.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can say there&amp;amp;#39;s no intrinsic value, if you keep the definition more narrow, and not include tech or software as solutions or having any value. And with a more narrow definition, I can agree that at the very least, intrinsic value is not strong.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;2.Useless ‚ÄúTech‚Äù:  Blockchain is not innovative tech, it was inefficient and outdated the  day ‚ÄúSatoshi‚Äù created it and is even more so now, over a decade later.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That&amp;amp;#39;s a bit overlooking the hundreds of companies around the world already adopting blockchain technology.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Check out what IBM is doing for instance, and tell me if you think it&amp;amp;#39;s useless: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/topics/hyperledger&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.ibm.com/topics/hyperledger&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With smart contracts, you can now code anything you want and have it protected by not only cryptography, but a decentralized consensus system.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can use blockchain to ensure anything from information, to scientific research, to legal contracts, are not corrupted, and remove centralized consensus.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And it&amp;amp;#39;s not just blockchain. It&amp;amp;#39;s cryptocurrencies. They&amp;amp;#39;re not limited to just solving money problems, they can also be used to help create better systems for supply chains, like with VeChains for example.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here&amp;amp;#39;s a quick summary of how it works:&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__yfks8BK2A&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__yfks8BK2A&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you value decentralized consensus, traceability, efficiency, speed, reduced cost, being able to chose either strong transparency or strong anonymity, and security, then blockchain is something you&amp;amp;#39;ll find valuable.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/0oofbs51bg191.jpg?width=1022&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=3d5dc102a5323c770a78072e759d75fb71363587&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/0oofbs51bg191.jpg?width=1022&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=3d5dc102a5323c770a78072e759d75fb71363587&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;3.Overly Complicated: Crypto is too complicated, slow and inefficient to  ever be used for anything. Your mom and grandparents WILL NEVER USE A  STSTEM where they need to remember a complicated seed phrase and  password and&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You don&amp;amp;#39;t actually have to memorize your seed phrase. But you have the extra option to, which can let you cross borders with your money in your brain.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My dad is in his 70s, and not only uses crypto, but trades it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Back before 2019, when I still used my local crypto ATM, I asked the guy in the shop what kind of people used the ATM. And he said that surprisingly, a lot of people are grandmas buying Bitcoin as a gift.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Of course, all this is anecdotal. But this is no different than people saying email was too complicated to use, back in the 90s.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now our grandparents are all using it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In fact, setting up a wallet on your phone is as easy as setting up any other app. Setting up a Coinbase account is the same as setting up a new online bank account.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Making a transfer is as easy as copying and pasting an address or scanning a QR code.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;4.Pollution: Already mentioned, wasting real resources that could power  an entire country for a useless excel spreadsheet Ponzi scheme.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This one I agree is an issue that needs to be seriously addressed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But things are going in the right direction. Increasingly more projects are going for proof of stake, instead of the heavy consuming proof of work. And Bitcoin miners are going for more energy efficient hardware, and try to use more renewable energy. They have to, it&amp;amp;#39;s in their best interest to cut the cost.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;5.It‚Äôs a Scam:  You are caught up in a worldwide delusional Ponzi, MLM scam that is already collapsing and ruining millions of lives.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That&amp;amp;#39;s partially true. Some of these crypto projects are straight up disgusting scams.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And on this sub, we always try to warn people about them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Wherever there is money involved, people are gonna try to scam you.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Whether they try to phish for your seed phrase, or the entire project is a scam, as we&amp;amp;#39;ve seen with everything from Bitconnect to Safemoon.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And some of the tech may not be a scam, but total jokes used to dupe people, like NFTs.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But things like Bitcoin, by definition, are not Ponzi scams. I explain why the term is incorrect in more details here:&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/u8rc0g/i_sometimes_see_people_call_bitcoin_a_ponzi/&quot;&amp;gt;https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/u8rc0g/i_sometimes_see_people_call_bitcoin_a_ponzi/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What I think people try to say when they call it Ponzi, is it&amp;amp;#39;s a greater fool scheme.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you don&amp;amp;#39;t believe Bitcoin has intrinsic value, then you can accurately say that it&amp;amp;#39;s a greater fool scheme. Where you have an asset of no real underlying value, and you&amp;amp;#39;re trying to find a greater idiot to buy it from you, for more than you paid for.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Of course, Ponzi sounds a lot more dramatic.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you managed to get this far, thanks for for actually reading all this! I hope you learned something. Or it at least opened your mind to do a little more research.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

But I&amp;amp;#39;m no crypto expert and don&amp;amp;#39;t trade any. I figured I&amp;amp;#39;d come here and ask the best. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/a/a3SJNMh&quot;&amp;gt;Here&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; are a few screenshots showing the balance and the &amp;amp;quot;support teams&amp;amp;quot; response in order to withdrawal it all. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They claim he needs to pay $62,000 in taxes from his own money separate from the balance in his account in order to withdraw.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here is where I come in. He calls &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Me&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; asking if he can borrow $62,000. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I told him I don&amp;amp;#39;t have the money simply because if it sounds too good to be true it probably is and I&amp;amp;#39;m not taking that loss.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: Name of the exchange is &amp;lt;del&amp;gt;Coinlist&amp;lt;/del&amp;gt; Coinlistxrt&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit 2: He put in 200k of his own money to grow it to 500k.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit 3: Overwhelmingly everyone agrees it is a scam some saying they have seen it before. Honestly, I feel terrible for him. He invested 200k and as it seems like that money is forever lost. That&amp;amp;#39;s some nightmare fuel. That being said if you are going to invest 200K into &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;ANYTHING&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; you should know it better inside and out than your ex-wife.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit 4: Press F&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit 5: Norton Safe Web Report courtesy of &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/u/Admirable_Ad1430&quot;&amp;gt;u/Admirable_Ad1430&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://safeweb.norton.com/report/show?name=coinlistxrt.com&quot;&amp;gt;link&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; for Coinlistxrt. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit 6: Some people have brought to my attention that the URL for the official CoinList is not the same URL as in the screenshot. The official Coinlist domain is coinlist.co and the one in the screenshot is coinlistxrt.com&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit 7: Turns out while Coinlist has a terrible reputation it is not the exchange he was scammed through. Looks to me like he joined Coinlistxrt which is an imitation of the official Coinlist.co site. Thanks to those who pointed that out.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit 8: Thank you for everyone who offered their support and helped out with this. This was my first post in CryptoCurrency and I want to say you all are awesome. I need to get back to work now. Thank you again!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This isn‚Äôt probably the type of post you see everyday, but I just wanted to ask others opinions on my idea.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I already know how private/public keys work, (I use SSH and PGP keys) and I know pretty much all about the fundamentals of how bitcoin works. I also have 3 hardware wallets, two ledgers (S plus and X) and a Trezor model T. (Don‚Äôt ask why I have so many)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I‚Äôve decided that I‚Äôm going to start stacking my coins in BTC, and save them for my future. I‚Äôm also wondering what other people‚Äôs thoughts are on this, personally I think it‚Äôs a great idea.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;PS: Scammers, don‚Äôt DM me, you just make yourself look like a dumbass and entertain me in the meantime.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Inflation is running rampant, markets are collapsing, banks have super high interest rates, and in general, there seems to be a general distrust in the established authority, who time and time we have watched bail out the big guys and watched as they make promises only to come up with excuses and more funding of wars.   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Point is the loopring and gme has a major following, and are loyal to these projects, and what are these projects trying to do?   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Well, they are trying to get rid of the status quo, with banks and exchanges, and even though their base may not be the most mature group, they are willing to take that plunge and &amp;amp;#39;buy into&amp;amp;#39; what the ceo of GME is selling, and often times its that blind faith in something that can yield amazing results. There is a vision, there is a substantial user base of younger individuals poised to bring newer people into he fold. The infrastructure has been released and is getting immediate adoption. Regulation has been making its rounds through government. You can pay in crypto. The groundwork is set...  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So as the overall financial markets tumble and faith in their eco systems deteriorate, they are fertilizing the grounds of decentralized finance.  As people pull  their money of out of these institutions, fearful of collapse, it only makes sense that a new system will rise in it&amp;amp;#39;s place. All major corporations are going to be watching GME and see what they are able to do, and if it even remotely begins to succeed, I think we&amp;amp;#39;ll see a huge ramp of decentralized finance. It will no longer be speculative, it will live, in the wild as an example of the promise of crypto on the center stage.   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We could even be in a bear market, but if these funds that were reserved for banks start flowing into defi, simply for self custodial reasons, the market cap in crypto will balloon. We&amp;amp;#39;re talking about scale we&amp;amp;#39;ve been hypothesizing for years. Who knows, but this could be the catalyst we&amp;amp;#39;ve been waiting for.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

A huge number of such apps have just launched out of nowhere. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Stepn for their part helps further the scam by closely controlling how many invites can be sent out each day, thereby ensuring supply/demand and the ponzi scheme doesnt collapse overnight. However they can only do this for so long. New people buying shoes are paying for early entrants to exit. Some time ago, the cheapest shoe to enter was around $700. At the end of this scheme, many will lose their investments they have put into the scheme. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is just similar to bitconnect where new depositors withdrawals were limited (you could only withdraw after some time in the system). If you control the entry and exit parametric of a devious ponzi scheme, you can further the time till it all collapses. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/62oorpohod191.jpg?width=1086&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=332688a2f5787dd9649103154300f65f774c38c4&quot;&amp;gt;However, Solana&amp;amp;#39;s founder thinks this is a \&amp;amp;quot;paradigm shift\&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Based on these recommendation from &amp;amp;quot;public figures&amp;amp;quot;, people are putting money into this expecting profits. If everyone understands it&amp;amp;#39;s a ponzi and still decides to play the game, knowing the first one out win and the last one baghold to zero - thats fine given how devious this industry is. But to promote it as a &amp;amp;quot;paradigm shift&amp;amp;quot;.... bruh&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some seem to think its not a scam because &amp;amp;quot;the app makes me go an extra mile a day and I also made $100, I cant possibly be scam&amp;amp;quot;. - this is the same kind of thought process that led to $40 BN being wiped off the market just 2 weeks ago.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Gods Unchained&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; - It is currently in Beta available to play on pc and mobile version is expected at some point but no official date has been given. (Trading card game)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Guild Of Guardians&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; -  is a mobile RPG where players can turn their gaming passion into assets. It will be a multiplayer, fantasy, action RPG where players build their dream team of ‚ÄòGuardians‚Äô and compete in a guild to earn epic, tradeable rewards.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Release was supposed to be early 2022 so I guess its running late but hopefully will be out soon, it looks like a decent game from the videos.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Ember Sword&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; - Free-to-play MMORPG with a player driven economy. This is probably the one I&amp;amp;#39;m most excited about as it looks like it will be really fun to play if they get it right, check the website for screenshots. I believe they have sold out of the land they had on presale.  Looks like they are expecting a late 2022 release.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Planet Quest&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; -  A cinematic gaming multiverse - I cant really tell what type of gaming experience this is going to be but it gives off Open world Role playing game vibes. looks really interesting and they are currently having a pre sale on planets which I assume will be an important part of the game play. Something tells me the soundtrack on this game is going to be really good.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://planetquest.io/&quot;&amp;gt;https://planetquest.io/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can also read up more on all of these games and other to come at &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://imxgrant.nft.gamestop.com/coming-soon&quot;&amp;gt;https://imxgrant.nft.gamestop.com/coming-soon&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So I&amp;amp;#39;m pretty excited that crypto games are starting to look better than the current offerings and hope some if not all of these deliver some decent gameplay.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And im not talking only about ape pfps being, well, ape pfps; im talking about the cringe of crypto &amp;amp;quot;influencers&amp;amp;quot; and meme pages that either post repetitive stuff like &amp;amp;quot;if you dont buy bitcoin now, you will regret it&amp;amp;quot; every 2 minutes and the absolute worst memes ever. Not to mention the comment sections with &amp;amp;quot;hodl hodl hodl üöÄ&amp;amp;quot; and bots. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;90% of people are here because of the money, 9% of the people are here because of the memes and the remaining 1% isnt loud enough to make the community look more serious than it actually is. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is also an obstacle for the mass adoption of crypto.
Imagine nations depending on cryptos with communities like dogecoin&amp;amp;#39;s.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

It&amp;amp;#39;s now the eight red candle in a row for Bitcoin, something that never happened before. The last record was six red candles and that dates backt to even 2013. One thing is sure we are in a bear market and quite an extraordinary one for Bitcoin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The current macro-economic situation is very unusual. We are having a stake of issues that are all worrying and will probably just get worse, all that while the FED is being hawkish. Probably one of the worst macroeconomic situations for the stock markets in the last decades. Also all scenarios are just not looking to get better, as Covid, Ukraine-Russia, Supply chain issues.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We are clearly in a slow-bleed scenario. Quite unusualy for Crypto, as Crypto likes to get a sharp dump at once and then just go sideways or up. Right now on the weekly it&amp;amp;#39;s a slow bleed. But as always this too shall pass and there will be a lot of needed relief afterwards.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Just few hours ago, he has made startling revelations claiming he has been approached by whisttleblowers who are willing to go public on the entire chain of events. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In a series of tweets, he implicates DoKwon, Jump Capital, Kanav Kariya (president of Jump Capital), and SBF (founder of FTX) of shady insider deals that have resulted in the destruction of 40 BN worth assets. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/6g9m645g58191.jpg?width=1164&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=95074bdd5437f53b5117b8160901012f32fd04c4&quot;&amp;gt;Says he was contacted by whistleblowers&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

According to these allegations, TFL already had a bailout in May 2021.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In May 2021, there was a similar depeg scare but which was quickly brought back to peg. At that time Kwon and TFL claimed it showed the stablecoin algorithm functioned as expected. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So how did this subreddit turn this into favoring bears when clearly bitcoin dominated throughout these two years?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is literally insanity, its blowing my mind how people have forgotten that bitcoin was priced at 5000$ and have JUMPED ALL THE WAY TO 69,000$ throughout both 2020-2021, and are fucking COMPLAINING WHEN IT DROPS TO MATCH NOT X14 INCREASE FROM 2020 BUT X6.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;HOW MUCH INTEREST RATES HAVE YOU GOTTEN FROM YOUR BANKS? 0.1%?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If bitcoin goes 20,000$, it would still be pretty mind blowing with respect to 2020 being 5000$, 400% INCREASE is still what the fuck&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In August of 2021, whitehat dev   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/0xfr_&quot;&amp;gt;@0xfr_ (Twitter)&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;contacted Do Kwon about a serious bug involving Anchor&amp;amp;#39;s possible liquidator issues. He was dismissed for &amp;amp;#39;raging&amp;amp;#39; and Do Kwon was &amp;amp;#39;pretty confident&amp;amp;#39; that it would work (you can already tell what&amp;amp;#39;s about to happen) &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In April this year, as per responsible disclosure,   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/skgBanga&quot;&amp;gt;@skgBanga&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;and   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/0xfr_&quot;&amp;gt;@0xfr_&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;emailed the Anchor team, describing three issues in detail (one of which could potentially cause hugely unfair liquidations due to a major bug in the liquidation queue). &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Anchor team never replied. Did they ignore the email? Did they just not bother checking their inbox? Either way, during last week&amp;amp;#39;s meltdown, Anchor accrued $20.8m in bad debt at a direct cost to depositors. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/throwaway0xfr/anchor-bad-debt&quot;&amp;gt;https://github.com/throwaway0xfr/anchor-bad-debt&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I remember seeing a lot of reports in the Anchor Discord of people being liquidated for their entire collateral instead of just what they owed. This bug explains it. Carelessness led to people&amp;amp;#39;s money being unfairly snatched away (again) &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the grand scheme of things, $20.8m is not that much (especially when UST was shedding billions from its market cap), but this event lends to a certain culture &amp;amp;amp; environment that seem to be present at TFL. Despite being paid millions, they seem to be flippant at times. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

He was the first to describe digital money and wrote his paper in 1983.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;quotes from the article:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In his paper, he describes the key point that his digital money differs from credit card payments through anonymity. Users receive the digital currency from their bank, but then it is made anonymous. This allows the bank to see who has exchanged how much money, but not what it is used for.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Chaum uses cryptography to create a blind, digital signature to make money anonymous. A metaphor best explains what this signature is&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;David Chaum then starts a company in 1989 and then creates a virtual currency call DigiCash.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It enables the secure and convenient payment of goods and services on the Internet. This distinguishes DigiCash from conventional credit cards, whose use is quite insecure in comparison&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What makes this even more intriguing is that apparently, Bill Gates at the time wanted to integrate DigiCash into Windows 95 but the deal fell short.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I find this both interesting and a bit conflicting considering Bill Gate&amp;amp;#39;s stance on cryptocurrency.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;edit: this is not poopoo on Gates because views can change. Personally I think he is one of the good guys even at one and still does support larger tax for billionaire and not the mention pumping billions into humanatarian work.   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
