What is VINU?

Vita Inu (VINU) is the world's‚Ä¶]]></description><link>https://crypto.buzzing.cc/en/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/tqk1h9/hey_redditors_im_sending_some_vinu_to_every/?score=340&amp;original_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2FCryptoCurrency%2Fcomments%2Ftqk1h9%2Fhey_redditors_im_sending_some_vinu_to_every%2F&amp;discuss_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2FCryptoCurrency%2Fcomments%2Ftqk1h9%2Fhey_redditors_im_sending_some_vinu_to_every%2F&amp;channel=CryptoCurrency&amp;sensitive=false</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://crypto.buzzing.cc/en/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/tqk1h9/hey_redditors_im_sending_some_vinu_to_every/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 29 Mar 2022 05:33:02 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&amp;lt;!-- SC_OFF --&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As the title says, I&amp;amp;#39;m giving away a bunch of VINU to everyone who comments on this thread! &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;As well, we will giveaway 5x100$ prizes!&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;What is VINU?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Vita Inu (VINU) is the world&amp;amp;#39;s first zero-fee, light-speed, dog coin with smart contracts!&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is a token built on the Vite network in November 2021 by Vite enthusiasts. Much like Nano (XNO), Vite is a DAG network with near-instant transaction times and zero fees. But in addition to that, Vite is the first public chain to implement smart contracts on the basis of a DAG ledger. Because of this, VINU is the world&amp;amp;#39;s first dog coin with near-instant transaction times, zero fees, and smart contracts! VINU is also proudly the #1 project on the Vite chain.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;VINU&amp;amp;#39;s philosophy is to provide education about cryptocurrencies in a fun and ethical way. It does so by building a fun and engaging community around the cryptocurrency project. It is also currently sponsoring a&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/i_fly_high_/status/1507916290706456577&quot;&amp;gt; blockchain awareness program in India&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; (and previously&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/VitaInuCoin/status/1469982262066176005&quot;&amp;gt; Nepal&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;), and will continue to do more for blockchain awareness elsewhere on the globe.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;VINU is unlike other memecoins. First, VINU is committed to paying all its community members fairly for their contributions to the project. Members receive VINU as rewards for moderating social media and community platforms, organising events, creating artwork, and so on. Second, VINU leans into transparency in legal compliance, with legal opinions valid in the EU and US. Last but not least, VINU is committed to the fair distribution of a significant portion of its total supply.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;VINU even has its own &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;tipbot&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; right here on Reddit, where our community can tip tokens without transaction fees &amp;amp;amp; you‚Äôll see it in action in the comments and over at our subreddit!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here‚Äôs some of VINU‚Äôs achievements in the past five months since its creation:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;And there‚Äôs much more planned for the project ‚Äì including a &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;metaverse (‚ÄúVinuverse‚Äù)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; with a full &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;VR World&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, a &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;decentralized swap (‚ÄúVinuSwap‚Äù)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;NFTs&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Games&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, and more.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As you can see, VINU is clearly one of the top dogs!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Did we mention there‚Äôs also a&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://getvinu.cc/&quot;&amp;gt; free faucet&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;How to participate in the Airdrop?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You will need a &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Vite address&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; to participate in this giveaway.

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Get your Vite wallet &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://app.vite.net/&quot;&amp;gt;here&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Here&amp;amp;#39;s a&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@VitaInu/how-to-add-vita-inu-to-your-vite-wallet-and-trade-on-the-vitex-exchange-16b4f8a4644b&quot;&amp;gt; guide&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; on how to set up your Vite wallet&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Comment your Vite address below!&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Follow us on our socials if you want more updates on our project:&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/VitaInuCoin&quot;&amp;gt; Twitter&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;,&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://discord.gg/vitainu&quot;&amp;gt; Discord&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;,&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://t.me/vitainu&quot;&amp;gt; Telegram&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;,&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://instagram.com/vitainucoin&quot;&amp;gt; Instagram&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;,&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/VitaInuCoin/&quot;&amp;gt; Facebook&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;,&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@VitaInu&quot;&amp;gt; Medium&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; (List of country-specific groups:&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://link.vinu.fun/&quot;&amp;gt; https://link.vinu.fun/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The giveaway will end in 48 hours, or when I run out of VINU, whichever is faster.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Don&amp;amp;#39;t miss your chance at getting yourself some free VINU!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Questions?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hop over to OUR REDDIT or join the community on&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://discord.gg/vitainu&quot;&amp;gt; Discord&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; or&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://t.me/vitainu&quot;&amp;gt; Telegram&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Our friendly neighborhood community moderators will be ready to help you!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;NOTE: We would be remiss not to point out that we‚Äôve been hugely inspired by the Nano giveaways on this sub in the past. In fact, Vite and VINU were created to allow &amp;amp;quot;feeless &amp;amp;amp; instant&amp;amp;quot; to be brought to Web3, and a significant number of team members from both projects were/are active Nano community members.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;EDIT:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;- Didn&amp;amp;#39;t receive a reply after posting your Vite address? This may be because the accounts making the comments have been rate-limited by Reddit. You should still have received your rewards. Verify all successful transactions here:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://vitcscan.com/address/vite_68e5d1a2e3913c31628841cc54d67da6bcf2beb4eb5860663a&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;http://vitcscan.com/address/vite_68e5d1a2e3913c31628841cc54d67da6bcf2beb4eb5860663a&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;- Didn&amp;amp;#39;t receive your VINU? This may be because the script that&amp;amp;#39;s handling the giveaway is stalling. We&amp;amp;#39;ll be monitoring its activity throughout the day, but there may be some gaps here and there. You&amp;amp;#39;ll receive your VINU, regardless!&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;- Getting an error from the faucet? This may be because your account is entirely new, and unopened. Once you receive your VINU from this giveaway, you should be able to start using the faucet.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I noticed something interesting about the current upswing in the market. When you set the BTC/USD chart to a 5 minute interval, you can clearly see only one massive order (or batch of orders) within 5 minutes started this price hike.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/j0sbflvux4q81.png?width=1241&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=88d9bdd33fc6ee760e479237cca70ddbdc1699ad&quot;&amp;gt;One massive 5m candle&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s reasonable to assume that only one whale was behind this and to me it&amp;amp;#39;s kinda frightening how one person or institution can move the whole market like that.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So maybe when the price rises high enough we will see an opposite candle of the whale selling and taking a nice profit and the market will be where it started. Or this was just done to liquidate shorts. Either way I would not treat the current positive price development as a new market wide trend just yet.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What do you guys think, am I being too paranoid?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: Link to the chart I used (you should be able to confirm that candle on any trading platform though): &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT?layout=pro&amp;amp;amp;type=spot&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT?layout=pro&amp;amp;amp;type=spot&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Set time to 5m on the top left.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit2: Because someone in the comments asked, here is the same 5 minute view around the time of the last ATH of 69k. This time the buys were spread out over ~45 minutes which looks a bit more (but not entirely) organic to me. But keep in mind: Getting near the 69k took days of upwards price movement before this spike.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

On the other hand, Banano, the one meme coin this sub likes, is hovering around market cap rank 1,000 and doesn&amp;amp;#39;t really want to pick up.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;11 days ago, ApeCoin was listed on many major exchanges. And don&amp;amp;#39;t get me wrong, I personally would never buy it - even in the speculative world of crypto, meme coins are a bit too risky for me, and Bored Apes look horrible and I don&amp;amp;#39;t get the appeal. But I still thought it was funny how the hive mind decided right at release that it &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;hated&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; the token, that it would fail immediately with 100% certainty, at that every negative thing about it would be upvoted massively, no matter how misleading or plain wrong.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One week ago, there was a &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/tij5jr/apecoin_is_down_more_than_20_in_a_day_this_might/&quot;&amp;gt;short but very dramatic post&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, saying that it went down 20% in a single day - nothing too weird for a new coin - and that this was the last warning before the &amp;amp;quot;real dumping&amp;amp;quot; starts, and that &amp;amp;quot;Everyone knows that project gonna dump hard&amp;amp;quot;. Nobody can predict the market, but a hard dump soon after release was always pretty unrealistic, considering it builds on a pretty well known brand (everyone has heard of those disgusting Apes) and the tokens the founders and BAYC holders received are locked for a pretty long time. But, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/cc&quot;&amp;gt;r/cc&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; being &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/cc&quot;&amp;gt;r/cc&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, of course it received 3.8k upvotes because &amp;amp;quot;APE bad&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Since then, ApeCoin has gone up more than 50%. And sure, it&amp;amp;#39;s generally a green week, but currently it is ranked 3rd of the top 100 coins, so it grew much more than most others.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;I have no idea how ApeCoin will do in the future. It might become as big as SHIB or even Doge, or it might slowly lose value over time and leave the top 100 at some point. I know I won&amp;amp;#39;t buy any. But this is a good reminder that this sub, on average, is terrible at predicting the market, especially when it comes to meme coins. Once this sub decides to hate a coin, it will ALWAYS be convinced its end is near. I don&amp;amp;#39;t have any advice for you, except: don&amp;amp;#39;t take positive posts about this sub&amp;amp;#39;s favorite coins or negative posts regarding its least favorite coins too seriously.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I wish people realize that we invest in crypto cause we got some goals for which crypto is the only way. That&amp;amp;#39;s why I refrain from talking about crypto with anyone.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I used to care a lot about fundamentals and utility when I was investing in coins but now I just don&amp;amp;#39;t see the point of caring about fundamentals.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We almost lost our most important values, fundamentals, utility, a good dev team etc.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s been 19 weeks or 133 days or 4.43 months since we got this bullish.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Let&amp;amp;#39;s hope this momentum stays on course and not reverse course just when things are getting good.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The field is clear of FUD in my opinion if the war continues to trend to how it is.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If the world goes right for just a few days, we will be above 50k by Friday.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I think it&amp;amp;#39;s safe to proclaim that this is your last chance to buy below 50k lol.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Finally, I was out of these stocks and could buy assets I believe in. But I was stupid and greedy. The crypto market was going up and I wanted to wait for a red day to buy. It wasn&amp;amp;#39;t even that much of a difference, but since it was a large amount of cash (for me), it just felt better psychologically to buy on a dip.   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But the dip never came. 42k never dropped to 41. Instead it has been shooting up everyday all the way to 47 now and beyond. If I just would have bought at 42k, I would be done, happy, and not feel like an idiot for trying to time the market.   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So don&amp;amp;#39;t be me in the future. Don&amp;amp;#39;t try to time the market in hopes of getting a slightly better price (unless you are an expert trader, which I am not). The best way to make money in this crazy market is to buy the best cryptos (BTC, ETH, and maybe a few top L1s) and chill. I knew this and try to always do it, but I got greedy once and got burnt.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Ethereum climbed up past $3.2k with its next resistance around $3.5k.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The US FED has promised to lower their monthly purchases of stocks and bonds, and is also starting to increase interest rates back from it&amp;amp;#39;s long 0% rate during the pandemic. This should put some downpressure on most stocks now that it isn&amp;amp;#39;t effectively &amp;amp;quot;free&amp;amp;quot; to continue to borrow massive amounts of money.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Obviously there&amp;amp;#39;s still a lot of uncertainty in the global markets with the war in Ukraine, but I don&amp;amp;#39;t see crypto taking any worse of a blow due to fear than regular stock and ETF options.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;China is also dealing with their massive housing financial crisis, which isn&amp;amp;#39;t made any better bycurrent events.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With inflation at all time highs (and is NOT transitory, likely to keep increasing) crypto is proving it&amp;amp;#39;s a necessity for storing value outside of fiat currencies.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Do you still work at your job? Did you quit?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you don&amp;amp;#39;t work, do you plan on working again?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Do you indulge in pleasures often? Or do you continue to save and invest?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What do you do all day? Do you go on crazy adventures like you fantasized about back when you didn&amp;amp;#39;t have as much money? Or do you still sit on youtube and reddit all day just like you used to?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If someone has reached this point in their early 20&amp;amp;#39;s what advice would you give them if they still sit on youtube and reddit all day?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You should be happy that as more big institutional money enters the crypto world, the total crypto marketcap increases, raises all boats and you, having already been invested, are making profits. Y‚Äôall need to accept that the people you don‚Äôt like have access to the same information that you do and they are going to invest in your coins. That‚Äôs the whole point. That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre here early for. To take advantage of the relatively small marketcap right now so we can be well off in 10 years when inevitably the MC will be probably 5+ trillion.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;P.s. stop buying coins that influencers are telling you to buy. Please. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

What people mean by this is that the protocol does not provide payouts to active nodes. This is in fact true. And while there are many valid counter arguments being made about whether payouts to nodes are necessary, these counter arguments seem to forget one crucial thing: &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Bitcoin does not provide an incentive to run a node.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Yes I wrote that correctly. The Bitcoin protocol provides absolutely no payout for running a node.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now I know what you are thinking. ‚ÄúYea it does, miners get paid‚Äù. But that idea is missing an important detail: Miners are not nodes and nodes are not miners. Sure most mining pools also run nodes, but you can also mine without running a node. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What is a node? A node an entity that listens to network information (blocks, transactions, etc) from the other nodes that it is connected to, and relays that information to the nodes that are connected to it. A node listens to blocks and transactions, and relays those blocks and transactions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In order to be a miner the only network interactions you must make are to: listen for blocks and transactions, and to send out the small percentage of blocks that you mine to one or more nodes. In order to qualify as a node, you would also need to relay blocks that you didn‚Äôt mine.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The next logical counter argument is ‚Äúwhy bother differentiating if all the mining pools run nodes anyway‚Äù? And this is a very good point. So good in fact, that it‚Äôs the philosophy upon which Nano is built. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Why do all the mining pools run nodes? Because it is convenient to do so. They are already listening to blocks and sending out occasional block solutions, so why not just relay all the blocks to listeners and run a full node. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Miners are just players in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Just like people who pay using bitcoin are players in the ecosystem. Just like Bitcoin exchanges and businesses that accept Bitcoin are players in the ecosystem. For some of these players it is convenient to run nodes, and for others it isn‚Äôt. Most people who buy stuff with bitcoin do so infrequently enough that it is not worthwhile to run a node full time. But most exchanges handle so many transactions that they may as well run nodes of their own. That is why most exchanges do, in fact, run their own nodes. Just like a lot of bitcoin businesses do. These nodes are what keep the bitcoin network alive. Without nodes there is no mining. Mining is nothing more than bitcoin‚Äôs solution to the byzantine emperor problem. The existence of nodes is a product of the convenience of doing so.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And this is the idea behind Nano. If a business wants accept Nano for goods and services, they would most likely want to listen to transactions on the Nano network to be aware of money received. So just like the Bitcoin miners, they may as well relay those transactions along in the network, and run a full node. Likewise exchanges would want to run their own nodes for the same reason. And guess what, they do. Just about every exchange that accepts Nano runs its own node. People run Nano nodes for the same indirect incentives that make people run bitcoin nodes: Its convenient.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I can go on about how Nano‚Äôs voting system works synergistically with the indirect incentive to run nodes, but this post is getting long and that‚Äôs a topic for another post. But can we finally put this argument to rest? Network players do not need a direct payout to be incentivized to run nodes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;TLDR: Nano provides no incentive to run a node, but neither does Bitcoin.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
