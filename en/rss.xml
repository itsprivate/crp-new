&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I understand you lost some money after being an &amp;amp;quot;expert&amp;amp;quot; in crypto for a year, let&amp;amp;#39;s hate on the newbies trying to figure out there way and asking questions on this subreddit. &amp;amp;quot;Hey what are you smoking bro, crack?&amp;amp;quot; You got the whole squad laughing, man. Just be a guiding hand to the newbies or can it with the harsh salty comments and criticism.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To make this platform a better space and to push people forward you need to be able to see to remove yourself from your own perspective and see it from another&amp;amp;#39;s eyes, less bias, less cult like mentality towards your favorite coins, and it&amp;amp;#39;ll be smoother for all of us.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Through support we can build a better community and some newbies here may go on to form their own startups and build the next big thing in crypto, what comes to mind when I think about supporting the community are launchpads like solanaprime that a providing a good platform for startups and support in their ventures for a change. Let&amp;amp;#39;s just be supportive and see how that plays out.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We can see you&amp;amp;#39;re trying to moon farm by making OP fall on their face, that&amp;amp;#39;s really pathetic. Be the bigger person, help them help you. That&amp;amp;#39;s my 2 cents on the matter.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What&amp;amp;#39;s really happened is that the government told every exchange in Canada to block any deposit coming from those 40 wallets. That&amp;amp;#39;s totally different than blocking a wallet.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitcoin is free and always will be.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Nobody can stop those people to use their BTC how they want. They can pay anyone they want and no government can block a transaction in the blockchain. What they can&amp;amp;#39;t do is to send btc to a Canadian exchange and to convert it to fiat. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I think most people forgot that Bitcoin was created in order to be an international currency free from any government control, and nothing changed. If people use btc just to make a profit and then convert it to fiat, that&amp;amp;#39;s not Satoshi&amp;amp;#39;s fault and not his original idea. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I don&amp;amp;#39;t sympathize with the convoy protest, I don&amp;amp;#39;t really care about it, I just don&amp;amp;#39;t like the idea that governments can control or block anyone&amp;amp;#39;s money. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If everyone would start accepting payments on btc (or any other crypto) no government could block or control the economy.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;By the way, any exchange not located in Canada could easily accept those btc because they&amp;amp;#39;re not under Canadian jurisdiction. I&amp;amp;#39;m sure Gate, Coinex, Kucoin and similar have no problems about it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You have to think about this stuff. Start talking more about it, and inform as many as possible that our choices on who to champion have to change, and it&amp;amp;#39;s better to do whatever you can to make life better as a whole for everyone else.   I&amp;amp;#39;m not talking miracles here.   Just help when you can.  See your neighbors trash can tipped over, pick it up.  See a car broke down on the side of the road. Stop.  At least 100 cars drive by someone broken down before someone stops.    Most of those people driving by will say &amp;amp;quot;ah.. they&amp;amp;#39;ll be fine. Someone will stop for them&amp;amp;quot;. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;amp;quot;You know. I was poor (like you losers). But it didn&amp;amp;#39;t stoped me from trying. And you shouldn&amp;amp;#39;t too. Stop nagging and start trying. I am here for you guys! (Yes. It is pure altruism which drives these guys).&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He even gives away the first dose of his magical &amp;amp;quot;be rich in a month&amp;amp;quot; telegram channel for free. Just like my old neighborhood&amp;amp;#39;s dealer. Only what that dealer has sold actually worked. His magical channel gives 10 or more &amp;amp;quot;buy&amp;amp;quot; signal per day which &amp;amp;quot;magically&amp;amp;quot; around 50% of which turns out to be true! But hey! &amp;amp;quot;What is with all negativity?&amp;amp;quot; he tells his followers on Instagram. And god there are so many of them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The &amp;amp;quot;premium&amp;amp;quot; version of his telegram channel has around 100k members. Each paying around 20$ per month for subscription. Which means 2 million dollar per month just from his telegram subscribers. but that&amp;amp;#39;s not the only method of income crypto influencers have.
He just need to say &amp;amp;quot;buy (put a random shotcoin in here)&amp;amp;quot; and that shitcoin will indeed goes &amp;amp;quot;to the moon&amp;amp;quot;, Usually for few days or week before everyone panic sells. Those who made a quick buck will worship him even more and those who didn&amp;amp;#39;t, well, they should grow the fuck up and &amp;amp;quot;understand that it is all a part of the road to success&amp;amp;quot;. He is not lying tho. It is all a part of the road to success, his road.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now think about the above scenario.
Not only he can buy that coin before the pump and sell at the top, he (like most influencers) can charge a tone of money for advocating that same coin. Two birds with one stone if I ever saw one.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With that kind of cash flow, famous crypto influencers can afford an extremely luxurious and joyful life and all they need to do is to show it off on social media to attract even more cluless victims. That&amp;amp;#39;s why they love to show off their wealth so much. The message is clear.
&amp;amp;quot;You can be a winner too! You just need to follow my model.&amp;amp;quot;
It is a dream comes true for them. A dream which spells nightmare for thousands.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I always hated influencers. They are champions of a system who triumphs on making people hate themselves and their life. A system made on top of people insecurities to sell them more and more junk they don&amp;amp;#39;t need. Everything about them is fake, everything fabricated. Body, face, smile and even happiness and love.
But crypto influencers are even worst. Not only they do all the things that usual social media influencers are doing, They are literally using ponzi schemes in broad daylight to rob people who trusted them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Tldr: fuck crypto influencers. They are even worst then Kardashians.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Look, I think the Bitcoin narrative as an inflation hedge and as an institutional asset is great, especially during the massive monetary expansion that happened in 2020. But the number go up narrative is FUCKING BORING! Bitcoin is NOT a tame lion, kissing the ass of all these big institutions with the hopes of buying our bags in not in line with the Bitcoin brand. Bitcoin is a counter culture movement and the last 2 years we&amp;amp;#39;ve turned into a pro-establishment movement. Kissing the ass of all these Black Rock ESG cucks and trying to onboard all the corporates makes me puke. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m furious and disheartened to see the Canadian government move to disband patriotic protesters fighting for basic human freedom and choice.  Now Trudeau gives them the power to seize funds from crowd-funding sites &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;and banks&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; if they don&amp;amp;#39;t like what you stand for???  HOLY SHIT.  They say it&amp;amp;#39;s temporary, we shall see.  I know what I think about &amp;amp;quot;temporary emergency government measures&amp;amp;quot; based on historical context.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also, the SEC ruling over BlockFi that halts new interest accounts for any American that does not have at least $3m in investible assets is insane.  This will for sure spread to Voyager, Celsius, Gemini...etc.  I believe this is being done in coordination with banks to drive assets back to legacy institutions and prevent the ordinary person from achieving financial security and remain in a perpetual state of monetary slavery.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We are firmly in the &amp;amp;quot;..and then they fight you&amp;amp;quot; stage.  The walls are beginning to close in on ordinary citizens as their fears of being made irrelevant by this digital peaceful revolution increase.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We need truly decentralized protocols providing these type of financial services now more than ever.  Go get yourself a home mining rig for non-KYC bitcoin, spin up a full node on TOR, stack your sats like an animal, and dig in your heels.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The fight is upon us and I for one will die on the hill of financial freedom, choice, and sovereignty. I suggest you also act accordingly.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

As such crypto had a healthy pump today in line with market investors expectations.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However, the FED are highly like going to have to make some real steps towards taking inflation in March.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Although a lot of those is already proced in, the extent of the damage to the economy is highly likely to mean a correction to interest rates above what was previously expected.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Of course, once that is over with there is a real chance of smooth sailing right up the bull market mountain again.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The CEO of the smartphone company came to the realization that Africans can afford smartphones but can&amp;amp;#39;t afford to pay for them all at once, which is why he wants to offer smartphones where you pay a larger sum at the beginning and then a monthly subscription fee. The subscription also includes a preinstalled tech stack, which will also include the Algorand Wallet. In addition, a neobank is being worked on. The neobank, which builds on Algorand, will offer a whole suite of financial products from insurance to loans. In addition, people will of course have access to the various Algorand projects such as supply chain management for farmers and so on.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The company is also working on licensing deals with other manufacturers such as Apple so that more smartphones can be offered. After one year, the smartphones will be upgraded automatically. The whole thing is to start soon in Tanzania.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/uof11fwz8zh81.png?width=2846&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e97ee0268ec502e5d8adb5a9aa93c018cdedc9ae&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/uof11fwz8zh81.png?width=2846&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e97ee0268ec502e5d8adb5a9aa93c018cdedc9ae&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then there is the fluctuation/ discrepancy with global market cap; atm CMC says the market cap is down 8% (stands at $1.72T), whereas Coingecko shows a +6% day (stands at $2.07T). $300B just disappears, only to reappear later in the day? Why does this happen? Almost every day I&amp;amp;#39;ve checked recently this has happened.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/ajag35049zh81.png?width=2846&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=5e38078c3bd2a37b41c9c9f3c18d11667d08aeaf&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/ajag35049zh81.png?width=2846&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=5e38078c3bd2a37b41c9c9f3c18d11667d08aeaf&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then there are the market cap rankings which on CMC for some reason exclude a great many from the top 100 even though their marketcaps are larger than those above them (is this opinion being injected into rankings or is this just a coding error?). The list down from the 90s to 100 is remarkably different between the two:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/2pvlt09h9zh81.png?width=2846&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=1cea6bf85b1ce6c3d0d9b2084ed2085ed3fed777&quot;&amp;gt;CMC&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/93ueas3i9zh81.png?width=2846&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=4ec4ab5f53edb30925a562f75c98f455f660fd41&quot;&amp;gt;Gecko&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then there are the rewards from collecting &amp;amp;#39;diamonds&amp;amp;#39; on CMC and the &amp;amp;#39;candies&amp;amp;#39; in Coingecko. This is a smaller quibble, but on CMC the options mainly consist of NFTs and promotions for other projects (and are mostly limited in quantity and time available), whereas Coingecko offers e-books for furthering understanding of crypto, and discount codes for VPNs and news sites (you know, something more functional than a picture of a cartoon lion) - and they don&amp;amp;#39;t appear to be limited (correct me if I&amp;amp;#39;m wrong). Of course it&amp;amp;#39;s effectively free (don&amp;amp;#39;t look a gift horse - or a DeRace NFT Horse - in the mouth, but there&amp;amp;#39;s a clear difference in tone between the two).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/3sscfdxl9zh81.png?width=2846&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=f84725a6270dcf7b8b1697b9d850d58d5cbc2284&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/3sscfdxl9zh81.png?width=2846&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=f84725a6270dcf7b8b1697b9d850d58d5cbc2284&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/5iebljnn9zh81.png?width=2846&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=043a822bd3687daef22a05b0b0f552058bc54506&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/5iebljnn9zh81.png?width=2846&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=043a822bd3687daef22a05b0b0f552058bc54506&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I guess my point is, considering CMC is the main site I see pushed for crypto rankings and info (not necessarily on this subreddit but definitely on social media in general), it falls short in multiple ways.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Many well known projects are incredibly popular with devs. Thousands of new devs are joining the crypto space each year.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On the other hand, many other projects, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;collectively worth billions,&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; are effectively abandoned by their developers. Others have none or virtually no open source code to begin with.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On average, projects in the top 500 market cap get updated 357 times a year by their devs. There are potentially hundreds of assets that don&amp;amp;#39;t appear to be updated anywhere near that level.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Many of the projects above haven&amp;amp;#39;t been updated a single time in the past year. Others just a handful of times. The &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://stack.money/article/abandoned-crypto-projects&quot;&amp;gt;full report is here&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; if you want to see each one in detail.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you&amp;amp;#39;re just trying to trade the hype, then this might not matter to you in the short term. Over a longer time period, though, the reality is bound to catch up with these &amp;amp;quot;dead&amp;amp;quot; projects. Investing in a project that is no longer being actively developed is clearly adding another layer of risk.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As always DYOR.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: The word &amp;amp;quot;popular&amp;amp;quot; in the title is causing some controversy, as it&amp;amp;#39;s obviously subjective. These are just the 10 largest by market cap. The total market cap of the 10 projects is over $3B, so clearly some people must still be holding a lot of these coins &amp;amp;amp; tokens.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

MineXmr (a supposedly infamous) mining pool, now owns &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://pools.xmr.wiki/&quot;&amp;gt;52% or more of network&amp;amp;#39;s hashrate&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. Know that Monero mining is special and has been touted to be more decentralized as it supports CPU mining, which has been the case so far. Even China&amp;amp;#39;s infamous ban, did not bring down network hashrate, just like it did to Bitcoin&amp;amp;#39;s 50% dip in hashrate.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However, in the past 24 hours alone, there has been close to 15% jump in the hashrate from 44% to 52% odd at mineXmr. This does not seem normal and has now become a major point of discussion that it could be seen as a deliberate attack on the network to double-spend.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The major problem is, the amounts spend/received cannot be deciphered, given it remains hidden on the Monero blockchain. Once hashrate has crossed 50%, anything is probable.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The ONLY trust factor is MineXmr owner remains loyal to the blockchain. Trustless has now become - trustful. And he is not willing to bog down, and he does not care and is willing to keep adding more hash power to his pool&amp;amp;#39;s throughput.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Really Sad!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;More more info, read here:&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/51-attack.asp&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/51-attack.asp&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;EDIT1: &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;51% Attack Real-World Examples&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Krypton and Shift, two blockchains based on &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ethereum.asp&quot;&amp;gt;Ethereum&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, suffered 51% attacks in August 2016.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In May of 2018, Bitcoin Gold, at the time the 26th-largest  cryptocurrency, suffered a 51% attack. The malicious actor or actors  controlled a vast amount of Bitcoin Gold&amp;amp;#39;s hash power, such that even with Bitcoin Gold repeatedly attempting to raise the exchange thresholds, the attackers were able to double-spend for several days, eventually stealing more than $18 million worth of Bitcoin Gold. Bitcoin Gold was hit again in 2020.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Recently, the Bitcoin SV (BSV) network suffered an attack in August 2021.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;EDIT2: An important comment by &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/MaZZeL3L/&quot;&amp;gt;MaZZeL3L&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yeah 51% attack is not a healthy thing and I wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t accept any payments as  final until a few blocks of confirmation but right now there&amp;amp;#39;s no real threat to the anonymity of transactions, nor the amount of coins in existence. they can&amp;amp;#39;t change consensus either.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;EDIT3: BEST explanation by &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/u/cndvcndv&quot;&amp;gt;u/cndvcndv&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If the miners keep that going, it&amp;amp;#39;s not gonna be great for them at all. No one will accept to get paid by XMR even for trades. That would cause the price to drop and reduce their profits. That&amp;amp;#39;s really reckless.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;From the perspective of other miners, they might feel scared that their blocks will be kicked out of the chain. I hope that doesn&amp;amp;#39;t cause them to move into mineXMR. I don&amp;amp;#39;t know how one would break that positive feedback loop unless the price hits bottom.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I love XMR; it&amp;amp;#39;s sad to see that happening.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

To be fair, I had stopped actively buying with them a year ago, but had decided not to sell since they had announced they were developing crypto wallets. So I decided to just hodl until I could transfer out... and that time has finally come! Last night I finally received word that my wallet was ready. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;As of this morning the remaining assets I has hodling have been transferred OUT!&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Screenshot: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/a/unzF2sS&quot;&amp;gt;https://imgur.com/a/unzF2sS&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;I STRONGLY urge you to do the same if you have not done so already.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; It&amp;amp;#39;s worth the gas price too (&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://ycharts.com/indicators/ethereum_average_gas_price&quot;&amp;gt;which is a little lower than normal right now&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;). If you&amp;amp;#39;ve quietly been waiting for your Robinhood crypto wallet, it should come soon. I was around number 55k in line to receive mine.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Why transfer out?&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; If you&amp;amp;#39;re not aware, Robinhood restricted trades during the the GameStop/meme-stock mania last year which effectively helped shady hedge funds and hurt regular folk like you and I (&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/investing/robinhood-backlash-what-you-should-know-about-the-gamestop-stock-controversy/&quot;&amp;gt;see more about that here&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;). They were also fined $70M by FINRA over other shady practices, including having &amp;amp;quot;outages&amp;amp;quot; during big market swings between 2018 and 2020 (&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/30/technology/robinhood-fined-misleading-customers.html&quot;&amp;gt;check that out here&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;). This was especially a frustration last year when Robinhood suddenly suffered &amp;amp;quot;technical difficulties&amp;amp;quot; during the epic Doge runup (&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419159/robinhood-dogecoin-outage-crypto-trading-crash#:%7E:text=Robinhood%20confirmed%20that%20it%20experienced,the%20beginning%20of%20the%20day&quot;&amp;gt;more info here&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;). So then, it&amp;amp;#39;s pretty clear that Robinhood&amp;amp;#39;s interests are NOT with you. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Why trust them with your assets when they block you from making financial decisions during critical market movements?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m not the only one in this sub that is alarmed by Robinhood, please see these additional posts and comments from our fellow sub-mates for more information so you can make your own decision:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TLDR: I finally moved all my crypto off Robinhood now that they enabled my crypto wallet. You should too because they are shady AF.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
