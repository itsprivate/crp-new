Lets use bitcoin for example, its at about 36.5k right now. If I have $10,000 to spend, I don&amp;amp;#39;t want to just wait until it drops a bit and just spend the $10,000 all at once. I start edging in, just in case it goes lower to protect me from volatility. I set up buy orders:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;$1,000 at 34k&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;$2,000 at 32k&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;$3,000 at 30k&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;$4,000 at 28k&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This isn&amp;amp;#39;t perfect, but it has protected me from volatility a bit and certainly stopped me from dropping all my money on a coin at a higher price.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: Some people are saying this is DCAing. Dollar Cost Averaging is investing money at certain intervals regardless of the price. For my example it would be like $1000 a month over the next 10 months&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That made me wonder why it is called &amp;amp;quot;dead cat bounce&amp;amp;quot;. 
Is it a dead bounce from a living cat? 
Is it because the graph looks like a dead cat? 
Is it because a cat just like a chicken can bounce around for a little bit even when dead?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So I Googles it, and now you don&amp;amp;#39;t have to waste 30 seconds of graph staring or reddit scrolling, to do it yourself.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What I found is that it is called a &amp;amp;quot;dead cat bounce&amp;amp;quot; because of the old saying: &amp;amp;quot;even a dead cat will bounce if you drop it from high enough&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Seems pretty grim to me, but that&amp;amp;#39;s why it is called what it&amp;amp;#39;s called.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A good reason to invest in them is because they are considered as blue chips. For those who don&amp;amp;#39;t know, a blue chip corporation is one that is financially stable. In this case, we&amp;amp;#39;re talking about cryptos, and a blue chip coin is one that has a market capital of more than $ 2 billion.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Another reason to invest in them is because of it’s support to projects like Qtum and Envision which brings the best of both coins mentioned in this &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://cryptobullsclub.com/best-innovative-peer-to-peer-exchange-networks/&quot;&amp;gt;article&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. When BTC rises, your entire portfolio climbs with it. Investing in BTC and ETH is equivalent to investing in the entire cryptocurrency market which also means that BTC and ETH also drive the market. Reinforcing the market and increasing the safety of your subsequent bets.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yes, neither BTC nor ETH will offer you fast riches, but they both promise decent returns and allow you to hedge your bets. Everyone has a varied risk tolerance for a variety of reasons; there is no shame in aligning yours with the relative stability of BTC or ETH. You&amp;amp;#39;d still have ETH and BTC working for you even if you lost your insane risky investment.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I can understand why : stupid apes jpegs and the &amp;amp;quot;crypto-bro&amp;amp;quot; subculture is kinda annoying.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But here is what a lot of people need to understand : NFTs are much, much more than jpegs. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s a piece of technology that has the potential to revolutionize a lot of things in our daily digital lives.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Let me illustrate my point. Last week, there was an ETH hackaton organized by ETHglobal. In two days, participants created 255 different projects related to NFTs. Here&amp;amp;#39;s some very interesting projects that have nothing to do with &amp;amp;quot;stupid jpegs&amp;amp;quot; :&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Creativerse, a Minecraft server connected to Ethereum where lands and buildings are turned into NFTs - that means that nobody can censor you. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;0xPhotos, a stock photography marketplace that enable creators to get royalties everytime their photo is used. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;veNFT, a DeFi projects that gives rewards to owners willing to stake their NFT. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;ENS-Signature, which aim to integrate Ethereum Universal Sign-In into official documents such as DocuSigns. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I think I&amp;amp;#39;ve made my point : we are in the very early stages of a groundbreaking technology going mainstream. In ten years, those of us who choose to invest in this sector will be called &amp;amp;quot;lucky&amp;amp;quot; by the very same people that are laughing at NFTs right now.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Keep your mind open. Don&amp;amp;#39;t believe the lies ignorant people are telling you. DYOR, and you will see a lot of opportunities. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;NFTs will be everywhere in our digital lives in less than a decade.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cardano has many advantages comparing to other L1 projects:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Academic team who are actively researching new horizons and publishing papers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Novel double layer architecture.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It has Great security.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;4.it is extremely sustainable and environment friendly.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It almost entirely decentralized.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is one of the few top projects with low share of its coins in the hands of whales (if I remember more than 80% was owned by small hodlers).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;transaction are fast and very cheap.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;An increasing number of developers are using its blockchain.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For all it this pros and many more, the only cons I heard about is the recent congestion which almost any crowded blockchain experienced so far. People forgive ETH for practically everything but cardano is bad because of a congestion? Or because it didn&amp;amp;#39;t grow much in market value? 
Or is it another reason which I missed? Like annoying fan base?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I really think ADA doesn&amp;amp;#39;t deserve so much hate. It is a solid project with a really nice team and it might have a bright future ahead of it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Maybe it&amp;amp;#39;s a social engineered manipulation by big actors on that sub.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They are missing the big picture:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Why would I ever give up my Bitcoin for printed-to-infinity government coupons (IOU&amp;amp;#39;s)?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Neo: what are you trying to tell me, that I can trade my bitcoins for millions someday?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://gyazo.com/10ead3a5c1fd8ed1e9d150ed6cced62d&quot;&amp;gt;Morpheus: No, Neo. I&amp;amp;#39;m trying to tell you that, when you are ready, you won&amp;amp;#39;t have to&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;When measured in fiat, Bitcoin price will rise infinitely&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Bitcoin has no top, because fiat has no bottom&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I will NEVER sell my Bitcoin for printed-to-infinity government IOU&amp;amp;#39;s, the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-kKDR30Fb8&quot;&amp;gt;same as somebody who bought a block in Manhattan on the 1800&amp;amp;#39;s&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; will never sell it no matter how high the price goes when measured in ever-worth-less USD.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You earn in value appreciation/equity against USD as well as in the expensive rents your tenants are paying. If you need even more fiat you borrow against it, and pass the prime real estate to your children and grand children... for many generations, and they don&amp;amp;#39;t ever sell it for fiat either.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I have had an account at this bank for about 15-16 years, my parents opened an account where I couldn&amp;amp;#39;t touch the money until I am 18 years old. I am 28 now so I have been personally using this account for exactly 10 years.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Major investors like VC and private equity funds, put their money into projects with a roughly five year time horizon (when they have to pay back their investors.)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Literally billions of dollars have flowed into the crypto markets in January, 2022 alone. Temporary price movements have little to no effect on these investor decisions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As the old sports saying goes, hockey players skate to where the puck will be, not where it is now.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Other trends point in the same direction.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;More and more banks are going to offer crypto trading services (watch out for those fees) according to industry stalwart American Banker (&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.americanbanker.com/list/7-tech-trends-to-watch-in-2022-from-crypto-banking-to-biometrics&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.americanbanker.com/list/7-tech-trends-to-watch-in-2022-from-crypto-banking-to-biometrics&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;). &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They do this because they project continued demand for these services, which requires them to spend money on infrastructure, marketing, It teams, to make it happen. As slow as banks generally move, the fact they are offering these services is a longer-term plus.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Still not enough positive momentum?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Consider which Blockchain/web 3.0/tokenization projects are actually making services better, faster, or cheaper (or will relatively soon.) The tech adoption curve starts out slow, but eventually sweeps upwards over time (no one knows how long it will take until there&amp;amp;#39;s mass adoption.)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crashes like this shake out weak projects, get-rich-quick traders (they&amp;amp;#39;ll be back when green days return, no doubt), and other fad chasers. That doesn&amp;amp;#39;t change the longer-term trajectory of the industry.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

If you&amp;amp;#39;re freaking out because you YOLO&amp;amp;#39;d your savings into Dogelonmars42069, then yeah, you might have to learn a few hard lessons.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For the rest of you who have done their best to invest in more time proven projects like BTC/ETH its time to buckle up relax and wait for this all to blow over. Freaking out and panic selling to save a fraction of your investment wont help your future self. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Nobody knows anything. This might be a blip or a bear market. The best way to last in this space is to take a breather, zoom out, and realize eventually everything is gonna be alright. Success does not happen overnight.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;If you&amp;amp;#39;re freaking out now because you made some bad investments or over-extended yourself use this time as a learning opportunity.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I am not a crypto wizard. I made every mistake a newbie could make. Back in 2017-18 you could buy crypto with credit cards lol. But what I hope I&amp;amp;#39;m conveying is that if you hold onto your coins you&amp;amp;#39;ll most likely come out ahead eventually. In 2018 was so depressed and mad at myself I just uninstalled my apps and didnt look at my crypto until 2020. But then it got better and most of the projects I invested in back then started doing well again. If I had sold and not weathered the dip I would&amp;amp;#39;ve been even more angry at myself.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Remember to take time for yourself. Stop staring at reddit and charts all day. Please talk to someone if you&amp;amp;#39;re thinking about self-harm. It gets better yall. =)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But I know what you&amp;amp;#39;re all thinking 365 days is a long time. How can you possibly hodl an entire year?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/khkvtg7ypnd81.png?width=746&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=7122a5ef2330b0688c5619531d6b23c3c2f18660&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/khkvtg7ypnd81.png?width=746&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=7122a5ef2330b0688c5619531d6b23c3c2f18660&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Based on my extensive research it takes roughly 3-4 weeks to sail across the Atlantic ocean. If you have a boat and leave right away, you should be able to do 7 round trips.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now lets say you can&amp;amp;#39;t swim or you don&amp;amp;#39;t have a boat:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/ryt7yq3esnd81.png?width=746&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=7149169688ad7a3681611b88733003bcd670c15f&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/ryt7yq3esnd81.png?width=746&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=7149169688ad7a3681611b88733003bcd670c15f&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Since all you guys keep talking about going to the moon, just go!!!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In 365 days you could go back and forth to the moon almost 45 times&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;so if a Saturn V rocket cost $185 million X 45 trips that comes out to $8,325,000,000.00&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I was in profit with a couple of coins and I was telling myself that I should get a few hundreds there, few from other coin  and just keep it in fiat or stablecoin or whatever, just save it for a dip or crash, nothing more, nothing less.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Of course, I always invested using DCA tactics and I will keep doing that, but I thought I should have a certain amount of money for a really big dip or crash and don&amp;amp;#39;t touch it untill it happens.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyway, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;don&amp;amp;#39;t be like me&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, keep some money in case of a drop, crash. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I decided to try purchase my first NFT yesterday, and holy hell was that confusing. Still is. I used my MetaMask account had $200 worth of ETH on there, tried to bid on something worth .007 eth but noticed I had to change it? Okay did the steps ended up back with Poly??? Or some sort of “wrapped ETH”And now down to $70 due to gas fees.. worse yet I don’t even have the NFT. 
Just imagine going out to buy a $7 dollar beer only to be charged $130 then only to have the bar tender give it someone else. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I know there must have been steps I did not understand and may have screwed things up a little. But holy hell if we want this to be a thing of everyday use, this shit can’t be happening.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;EDIT- thank you everyone explaining things to me. Im not trying to shit on anything and I still have full belief in where we are heading. 
I understand now that we are still very early stages and I guess I’m just used to being late to parties. 
That and ETH is kind of a mess and there’s more than just OpenSea to purchase NFTs. Genuinely was unaware cardano has their own system for it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I mean what I’m about to say as genuine advice, not to make fun of anyone, but a lot of people here really need to take a step back and look at the bigger picture. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Every day we have people stressing and speculating over the day-to-day movements of their crypto, panicking over bear markets, asking “where should I invest this spare $50?!” in the daily. When in reality, they could see their portfolio do a 2x by working a few solid minimum wage shifts and dumping the paycheck into crypto. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A nice 20% pump on the $100 you invested in your favourite alt-coin which you spent hours researching, still only leaves you with $20 profit. You could probably ask your mom for $20 and she’d give it to you. It might be a harsh truth, but crypto isn’t a life-changing opportunity until you’re working with a decent stack of money, until then, conventional money-making methods are faster and more lucrative (without the potential downside of investing!)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It’s not what you want to hear, but a couple hundred dollars in the market isn’t going to make you financially free unless you’re the crypto-embracing, second coming of Warren Buffett. Grinding out a real life job and dumping that money into crypto? That might just do the trick though.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Important disclaimer/reminder:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; I mean ZERO hate to small time investors whatsoever with this post. You guys are learning essential lessons and gaining investing experience without the risk and potential downside of others with more skin in the game, and most importantly, small amounts of money can mean a hell of a lot more to some people than others. I’m simply saying look at the bigger picture, and make the most of your time. Crypto becomes more rewarding the more you can safely invest into it, typical jobs might not have the potential of crypto, but they will build you a base and give you a start way faster and safer.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I hear you are scared about that bear everyone is talking about. Will it wake up, will it get eaten by a bull? I don&amp;amp;#39;t know. But while we have nothing else to do, why not take the time to learn something new?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So let&amp;amp;#39;s talk about impermanent loss before nap time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Imagine I have a dragon, and I want to trade it for a unicorn. Both magical creatures are the same price (because they&amp;amp;#39;re magic).&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I go to the toys store, but they don&amp;amp;#39;t want to buy back my dragon. So I need to find someone who is willing to exchange their unicorn for my dragon. I go to the flea market, and I find a merchant with 50 dragons and 50 unicorns in his stand. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;This is the liquidity pool.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The merchant accept to give me a unicorn if I give him my dragon. But as the merchant has to make a living, he charges me a small fee, about 2.5% of the value of the trade, to accept my proposition. I gladly accept to pay the fee, and I go home with my new unicorn.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But now, the merchant has a problem : he has 51 dragons and 49 unicorns. If more and more kids want to trade their dragons for unicorns, the imbalance will grow, and the merchant will eventually run out of unicorns. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The merchant needs an equal amount of dragons and unicorns on it&amp;amp;#39;s stand to make good business.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; So he goes to a friend and offer to sell him 1 dragon for a discount - the dragon is worth $10, so the merchant will sell it for $9.95. The friend accept (because that&amp;amp;#39;s what friends are for), he turns around and sell the dragon at full price, netting a profit of $0.05. He then buys a unicorn on the internet for $10, then goes back to the merchant, and sell it to him for $10.05, netting another profit of $0.05 (this is called &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;arbitrage&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;). The friend has now made $0.10 of profits, the merchant has done $0.15 (the original 2.5% fee he charged me, minus the $0.10 loss from the trades with his friend.) Everybody is happy!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;That $0.10 loss is what is called impermanent loss. It&amp;amp;#39;s the cost of maintaining the balance between dragons and unicorns on the stand.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now, of course, if the merchant didn&amp;amp;#39;t charge me that 2.5% fee, he would be losing money. But he does charge a fee, so he ends up doing profits anyway. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So why are people afraid of impermanent loss? Because if the price of one of the item explodes, and the other item does not, then the losses will be greater. If unicorns are now worth $20, the merchant will incur a greater loss when his friend helps him with the arbitrage. It sucks, and that&amp;amp;#39;s why some people don&amp;amp;#39;t want to be liquidity providers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But here is the thing : &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;fees are almost always more then enough to cover for impermanent loss.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; In our example above, if the price of unicorn doubles and the price of dragons stay the same, impermanent loss will only amount to 5.72%. It doesn&amp;amp;#39;t take much volume for fees to cover this. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There are a few caveats, tho. If you want to provide liquidity for shitcoins, you will absolutely get rekt if/when the shitcoins value goes to zero. That&amp;amp;#39;s why you should provide liquidity only with tokens you are comfortable holding long-term. Another good thing to keep in mind is that it is way less risky to provide liquidity for a pair that includes a stablecoin, because it&amp;amp;#39;s value will go unchanged. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Some ETH/USDC pools were giving a whopping 200% APR for a few hours yesterday.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Even if ETH shot up to a ridiculous price tag of $50 000 USD in six months, you will have made more money then if you simply hold.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Another thing to keep in mind is that &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://dailydefi.org/tools/impermanent-loss-calculator/&quot;&amp;gt;impermanent loss calculators&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; give you the estimate difference between providing liquidity and hold-only... that is, if you were somehow able to perfectly time the bottom and top of the market. As we know it&amp;amp;#39;s impossible to time the market, those calculators really give you an absolute worst-case scenario.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Oh, darn, time flies! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s now nap time, my young friends. Hope you enjoy my story... and I hope you will dream of dragons and unicorns.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
