It’s frightening. A top 10 asset, stablecoin at that, has crumbled to zero. People have lost millions in this. Imagine going for a week-long vacation and you’ve come back, your life savings disappeared. I’m really sorry for anyone who’s lost money in this. The last safe haven in crypto, stablecoin, is just as much of a quicksand as the rest of crypto. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Having said that, what happened this week needed to happen. And needed to happen now. The Luna crash is still reverberating in the markets and people are still anxious to put money back into crypto. If a stablecoin could fail, what else would your average person put money into? It’s a scary thought. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But Luna had to crash. Because imagine, if Luna didn’t crash. It was already on a meteoric rise this year. And when the depressed crypto market came back alive, Luna would shoot back up to $100, if not go beyond that. Luna was supposed to be the future of crypto. One of the market leaders. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If Luna didn’t crash now, but instead crashed when it’s gotten as big as Ethereum, at $500 billion, with the fundamental design problems that it has, I don’t know what would happen to crypto. Imagine if Ethereum went to zero tonight. That could potentially kill crypto for a few years, if not set it back a decade in terms of mass adoption. If the crypto market leaders fail, the entire crypto space becomes tainted and shunned. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now that Luna has failed, other algo stablecoins can learn from these mistakes. Create a better project, addressing these fundamental design issues. These are the growing pains that the crypto market needs while it’s still very young. Because ten years from now, these mistakes won’t be as tolerated.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The idea of losing all my Bitcoin really made me feel very uneasy, the solution was obvious, get a hardware wallet.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Setting up the Ledger Nano S was easy and transferring my BTC liberating, I can feel a weight lifted from my shoulders knowing I now have full control of my keys and my crypto. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If anyone is wondering &amp;amp;#39;what happens if Ledger go out of business?&amp;amp;#39; fear not! If Ledger did i go out of business, neither your cryptocurrency nor your private and public keys would disappear. You are totally safe.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Any investor that knows how to control these feels needs to have A LOT of will power and patience which obviously gives them an upper hand over other investors.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I myself haven&amp;amp;#39;t been able to master these emotions yet and a big part of this is cause I started out investing in meme coins and shit coins which are VERY panic and FOMO inducing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;See, what I’ve noticed with these calm and collected investors is that the majority of their investments are put into projects which have unique technology and most importantly a ton of development going around which almost always ensures that said projects will make it out of a crash in one piece.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some examples would be Ethereum with tons of technology and real world applications available or projects like Hedera with a ton of development going around now that Hbar Foundation is expanding their ecosystem with more than half a billion in funds allocated just for that.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There are a pretty big handful of projects that fit in this category and learning to invest in them and wait for the long term will help you learn how to control FOMO by not following the hype and will help you control panic by holding on these projects with good long term fundamentals.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Enough nodes are being targeted to cause settlement delays network-wide. Every targetted node is slower in processing, thus everything from block propagation to block confirmation is slower. Additionally, enough bandwidth is being used such that some targeted nodes may be at risk of filling up their disk (unchecked blocks get cleared every 4 hrs and on load — can also be cleared manually).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When the load subsides, the network will recover. The impact of this attack is settlement delays, no funds can be lost. According to my non-voting nodes, the average election duration is around 53 seconds currently (12:27 PM EST).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Developers are aware and have been working and discussing a variety of solutions (some new, some old). This is a good time to remind everyone of a few things:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;• network resilience is not binary (fixed / not fixed) and much more than just dealing with &amp;amp;quot;spam&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;• network resilience has been a focus, is a focus, and will continue to need to be a focus.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;• settlement delays and disruptions are to be expected as this is an experimental network under active development. I recommend being aware of these basics.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s going to take a lot of time and contributions before the network is sufficiently resilient (on a variety of fronts). This is the nature of building an open and distributed network, there are currently a number of known ways a motivated attacker can disrupt (or even take down) the network. The network becomes resilient over time with each newly discovered vulnerability and subsequent contribution of solutions/fixes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Over the years there have been 30+ disclosed ways to take down the Bitcoin network, which is simpler to defend in a number of ways. The nano network is not going to be any different.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Apple makes phones, Spotify gives you music streaming, Chase keeps your money safe, KFC serves you chicken wings, Zoom helps employees communicate, but what the fuck does Solana do for you? Currently valued at 18 billion, but why?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How can my mom benefit from Solana for example? How can a company benefit from Solana? And how is it different from Avalance, Aave, Matic &amp;amp;amp; the hundreds of other projects?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Remember, try to reply to me as if you were talking to a no-coiner, use real world example preferably.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Edit :&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; I&amp;amp;#39;m aware of the very obvious money transfer aspect, which is actually great yes, but there are thousands of cryptos offering exactly that.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I know there are many phone, banks and clothing companies too, but designer clothing doesn&amp;amp;#39;t serve the same consumers as kids clothing, just like with premium phones/cheap android phones or islamic banks/off-shore banks. Variety is necessary, but when it comes to money transfer, you just want it done as cheap and fast as possible.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So what does justify the existence of thousands of projects serving the same purpose (p2p transfers) more than 10 years after the invention of Bitcoin, some with billions in market cap?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Well at the previous Bitcoin halving (May 11 of 2020), we didn&amp;amp;#39;t notice any significant changes in the case of the price, BTC ended the day slightly lower, but according to some bystanders halving was one of the triggers for the major bull run that started 2 months later.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What we do know is that rewards will be halved and prices will therefore have to rise for &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;mining to remain profitable.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Satoshi himself has written in one of his replies that it would make sense for prices to rise.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I wanted to make my own thread of this issue because in the other thread, I did not feel that it compiled enough information in the body of the post to facilitate a healthy discussion of the current situation. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;USDT has lost about 6.6b in market cap since May 11, 2022 (~9% of their market cap). Historically, from what I have seen this has been the biggest drop ever in Tether’s history. So there is good reason to pay attention to it. I am not necessarily saying that a crash is imminent, but it is very alarming.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Historical, along with current data can be found here:
&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/historical-data/&quot;&amp;gt;https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/historical-data/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As we know, Tether is supposed to be backed by 1:1 to the USD by Tether’s reserves. Tether allegedly has fiat, bonds, and other assets to do this (will address this a bit more below). Even though Tether is near its’ peg, the change in market cap shows an overwhelming amount of redemption. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is concerning for a few reasons, for one because the overall market is down. Meaning, the assets in Tether’s reserve also most likely are down as well. I’m not just talking about the crypto market, either. Since we do not have full transparency in Tether’s backing, many have speculated it’s tied to assets like BTC, which is also way down as well. Meaning, their backing “power” may be lower than it was previously and not exactly at 1:1. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As an example, for arguments sake, let’s say that BTC was bought and fully backed the USDT. Their average price for backing was when Bitcoin was at 30k. Now let’s say the market dips, and bitcoin goes to 27k. At the same time, many start redeeming Tether to cash out to fiat out of fear of the market conditions. This means that the backing of Tether is no longer 1:1 and since people are redeeming, Tether would have to sell off its bitcoin reserves for a loss of 10% to cover the redemption. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;From the Cointest competition, we also found out that Tether has also previously lied about their backing: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/22620464/tether-backing-cryptocurrency-stablecoin&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.theverge.com/22620464/tether-backing-cryptocurrency-stablecoin&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; they have also never allowed a public third party audit. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And it was never completely backed by fiat fiat equivalents and treasuries. Instead, it was backed by a mix of fiat and bond equivalents, 50% being Chinese white paper and other unstable assets. It’s closely tied to China’s debt: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://cryptobriefing.com/report-alleges-tether-owns-billions-in-chinese-debt&quot;&amp;gt;https://cryptobriefing.com/report-alleges-tether-owns-billions-in-chinese-debt&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Tl;dr This whole situation is concerning because Tether is supposed to be backed 1:1, but may have potentially have minted more than they have backing for. And due to the magnitude of redemption (that we know from the drastic change in market cap), it’s also causing their backing “power” to be lower and lower due to broader market conditions, such as war, inflation, China lockdowns, etc. Thus also making USDT more unstable.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And I know what most will say, most fiat is exactly the same, however, it doesn’t have nations backing it as a main form of currency and trade. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We have also seen many people on Twitter having a similar sentiment, Daniel Wang, Loopring former CEO and current advisor stated:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;

The act of dissolving just days before the collapse of UST suggests the intent to eliminate responsibility of the aftermath, which serves as evidence that he knew something was going to happen. On top of it all, Do Kwon&amp;amp;#39;s Terra foundation sent 52,189 Bitcoin to Gemini and 28,205 Bitcoin to Binance, which were intended to serve as reserves to prop up TerraUSD (UST). So what happened here? This looks like one big premeditated crime to steal 2 billion USD worth of Bitcoin by means of using Terra Luna and UST as the front.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The majority of FOMO after all is simply just greed and events like this one should always be a reminder to overcome this feeling.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then there are the people who went all in on memecoins and hype coins and are full blown REKT right now. What did you expect? Its a coin that’s literally backed by &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;hype&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;nothing more.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yet again, events like this bear market should always be a reminded to invest in something that has actual backup.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Look at Ethereum for example. Its down bad but its holding up way better than other coins since it has actual technology and fundamentals. Or even Bitdao. Their price action has been one of the steadiest in the market cause of their massive $2 billion treasury backing them up with hundreds of millions of dollars of stablecoins and ETH.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Let this be a lesson to NEVER invest more than you can afford to lose and focus more on projects with fundamentals and backing rather than hype based coins that will most probably go to zero at the nearest market dip.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Crypto is dominated by software engineers who think they are more knowledgeable than they actually are, especially when it comes to fields like economics and finance that are FAAAAR out of their wheelhouse.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Terra&amp;amp;#39;s failure was a failure of economics more than it was a failure of engineering. Even the best software engineers are only as good as their inputs, and they had shitty inputs. They thought they understood supply and demand. They didn&amp;amp;#39;t. They thought they were coming up with something new. They didn&amp;amp;#39;t.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The whole Terra/Luna &amp;amp;quot;mint and burn&amp;amp;quot; mechanism is also known by another name in TradFi: the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deathspiral.asp&quot;&amp;gt;Death Spiral Bond&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. It is such a bad idea that it is only employed by the most desperate of companies because of how easily it can get out of hand. For an industry where innovation and meritocracy are supposedly valued, you&amp;amp;#39;d think someone with even a sliver of influence would have recognized it for what it was and raised warning bells. But describe Terra&amp;amp;#39;s mechanism to a single TradFi financial advisor or analyst, and they will politely decline your business and laugh at you when you walk out the door.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But if you think Terra is the only major crypto project that is deluding itself with overly optimistic assumptions about how economics works, you&amp;amp;#39;ve got another thing coming.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That should give you an idea of just how &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;incredibly&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; immature this industry really is, how little actual expertise is working on these things, and how much all of it is still in the experimental stage, even so-called &amp;amp;quot;blue chips&amp;amp;quot; like Bitcoin and Ethereum.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Even Satoshi was a terrible economist. He thought Bitcoin would make for a good digital cash, and it ended up turning into something no one wants to spend (&amp;amp;quot;HODL!&amp;amp;quot;) because everyone&amp;amp;#39;s too afraid it&amp;amp;#39;ll moon the next day. That makes it an objectively bad currency. And Bitcoiners are not alone in this. If you&amp;amp;#39;ve ever praised &amp;amp;quot;deflationary tokenomics,&amp;amp;quot; you&amp;amp;#39;re guilty of it, too.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Compounding ALL of that is the fact that the crypto industry &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;as a whole&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; is less than 15 years old. Ethereum is barely seven years old. And DeFi is less than two years old. Even the guys who invented Solidity don&amp;amp;#39;t have a decade&amp;amp;#39;s worth of experience in the language.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m not being anti-crypto, I&amp;amp;#39;m just being realistic. I&amp;amp;#39;m still invested (~10% of my liquid net worth) and still DCAing. But fuuuuck, I can&amp;amp;#39;t wait until this community gets its head out of its own ass about how &amp;amp;quot;innovative&amp;amp;quot; crypto is and how it will eat the TradFi industry, and just focus on building good and functional products instead of turning into moral philosophers about economics and politics.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Now, the creator of LUNA is obviously much more at fault in this case, but it&amp;amp;#39;s not like this shit couldn&amp;amp;#39;t be seen from orbit.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you lost money with LUNA, that&amp;amp;#39;s on you, honestly. I saw a whole bunch of posts both here and on the luna subreddit that asked the obvious question: &amp;amp;#39;If UST is backed by LUNA, what stops it from dropping if LUNA drops as well?&amp;amp;#39; and being met with nothing but &amp;amp;#39;this is FUD&amp;amp;#39; comments.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And then people here act surprised and sneer at others for saying they saw it coming. &amp;amp;#39;Hindsight is 20/20&amp;amp;#39; they say, except that&amp;amp;#39;s not true in this case. Many, many people were saying this, they just didn&amp;amp;#39;t want to listen.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you see so many warning signs and don&amp;amp;#39;t listen, then you and your money would&amp;amp;#39;ve been soon parted anyway.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But in the meantime Do Kwon making proposals to fork a worthless coin on a wortless chain? He is supposed to pay whats left back to the investors, but all he does is working on a second version, that is not containing any concept or priority on making anyone whole again.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Where you can, please provide reasons, or even evidence (if you have any) of why you are certain a project won’t work out.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
