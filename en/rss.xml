&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;(Yes, before of that I did spend a lot of time reading technical analysis book, reading blog posts, watching YouTube videos, but none of that really matter, it&amp;amp;#39;s mostly just luck.)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The smartest thing I&amp;amp;#39;ve done after making these profit is to quickly lock them into ETH 2.0 validator, so I keep myself away from gambling them away in market, and all my validators generate much more than I need for my monthly expenses.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I thought I&amp;amp;#39;m going to live a happy life after that enjoying all the money without having to work again, but one year later I find myself depressed, became a heavy smoker and drink quite often.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The reason is because I was a guy with big dreams, I wanted to have some achievement that I&amp;amp;#39;m proud to tell my family and friends, not how lucky I made some gambling money, but after getting these money, I&amp;amp;#39;m too afraid to make another move anymore, which made me feel like I&amp;amp;#39;m stuck.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Stuck because I do not have the experience or skills to get a job with rewarding that I feel like worth my time, nor want to work for anything less rewarding, especially when my validator income is like 5x~10x the salary of the job I can get.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And I obviously doesn&amp;amp;#39;t want to give up my wealth or take any more extreme risk with them, I believe I am not the only one feel the same, any thoughts?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;EDIT:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Thanks for all the response, didn&amp;amp;#39;t expect to receive so many replies, I really appreciate anyone who gave their advice, I would be going through one by one to read each of them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I understand that I will have to make some adjustment to my mentality, also happy someone recommended books, I do love to read books to learn different perspective to life.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;EDIT2:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; A lot of people have recommended travel, I will probably do that soon, the only thing holding me back is knowing that I am most likely going to be travel alone, and I&amp;amp;#39;m kinda introvert and socially awkward irl.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Regarding that other popular post, this doesn’t mean Ticketmaster can’t charge us ridiculous extra fees for facilitating concert ticket sales because they work with the people who own and operate the venue. Not the artists. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This has nothing to do with centralization and it has nothing to do with the form of currency they’re ripping us off in. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto won’t solve asset seizure or sanctions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It’s not designed to help you evade your taxes. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It’s not going to “dethrone” fiat currency because it’s not a competition. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto is a tool like the internet is a tool. It’s one component in a large machine and can be used to serve and to fuck us, usually at the same time. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We aren’t going to replace governments with a crypto backed DAO because the problem corrupt governments isn’t that we don’t have a shared ledger. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anytime there’s a problem and you think crypto can solve it, consider what the problem actually is and what having access to shared record would solve with respect to that problem. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Media blackout in your war torn country? Crypto doesn’t solve this. PayPal, gofundme, etc stopped processing your cash? Unless you can exclusively pay all your bills and be paid in crypto, it won’t help you there either. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At the end of the day, remember what blockchain is. It’s a decentralized ledger. It’s a SQL database that everyone can see and no one can modify. Only it’s slower and consumes far more resources than a single SQL server. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Unless the issue is ultimately rooted in ineffective record keeping, crypto doesn’t really solve it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The whole criminals and terrorists use crypto narrative.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;To the extent it is used, I fear it&amp;amp;#39;s often for illicit finance&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Crypto has obviously grown by leaps and bounds and it’s now playing a significant role&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;There are benefits from crypto and we recognize that the innovation in the payment system can be a healthy thing&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What a surprise that the government employee&amp;amp;#39;s tone on crypto changes once the people with the money are starting to use it to make more money!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I was recently reminded again why Ticketmaster is one of the most hated company in the world. I wish them a quick bankruptcy. I bought tickets for a concert and the tickets fees were more than 75% of the original ticket price. Which is absurd. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The internet is full of people complaining about Ticketmaster and their fees. For instance this hilariours woman:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Why are Badbunny tickets so expensive? Y’all making me want to sell pictures of my husbands feet on only fans – frustrated Ticketmaster customer&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@_j_e_n_n_/video/6950782961763601670?is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.tiktok.com/@_j_e_n_n_/video/6950782961763601670?is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the “Last Week Tonight” show, John Oliver explained the shady behavior of Ticketmaster in an entertaining way, including clips of frustrated Ticketmaster customers (like the one above). &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;A short recap:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- Average prices of tickets have more than tripled, since the 1990s (even before tickets hit the resale market)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- Ticket fees are determined in collaboration with Ticketmaster’s clients (Venues, Promoters, sometimes the artists)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- These other parties that share in the tickets fees are mostly owned by… Ticketmaster&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- Ticketmaster facilitates professional scalpers and multiple account use&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- In some cases less than 8% of all tickets for shows of major artists gets sold directly to the public. Where do the rest of the tickets go? To professional ticket scalpers&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- Professional scalpers represent the overwhelming majority of sellers on secondary market places&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- Scalpers mark-up the price  on average with 49%, but sometimes even hike up the price more than 10x&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- Secondary markets charge exorbitant fees&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The result of this is that the ticketing industry is very inefficient. Parties that do not create any value for fans and artists receive a big cut of the revenue &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_Y7uqqEFnY&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_Y7uqqEFnY&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;How can blockchain technology improve the ticketing industry?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- Blockchains are transparent and immutable. Scammy practices such as direct selling on secondary markets or selling huge amounts of tickets to professional scalpers will be visible to fans&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- Smart contracts can be programmed with a maximum resale price or maximum mark-up from the original price &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- Blockchain cut out the middle men allowing artist to sell more directly to fans&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- Tickets can include a royalty fee for artists, when tickets are sold resold (similar to royalty fees on NFT art). &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- NFT tickets become tradeable digital collectibles, allowing artists to interact with their fans even after the event&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;R.I.P. Ticketsmaster. I hope we will soon be able to buy tickets for our favourite artists without ridiculous ticket fees.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I think this is monumentally fucked up and shows how desperate and immoral a lot of people are. If you decide you&amp;amp;#39;d steal someone else&amp;amp;#39;s money given a chance and consider this a lottery ticket, then you are no different at all from the hackers and scammers that have ruined peoples lives. Apart from the intelligence of being able to directly carry off a plan to complete such a goal. To complain about anything revolving around a hack or a rug pull in the future would be the epitome of hypocrisy. So don&amp;amp;#39;t complain.

To put it short, it&amp;amp;#39;s a decentralized Reddit alternative that will use public key based addressing and p2p subnetwork to operate. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s pretty crazy alright. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Esteban believes that this design would solve the problems of a serverless, adminless decentralized Reddit alternative. It would allow unlimited amounts of the so-called subplebbits (subreddits), users, posts, comments and votes. This is achieved by not caring about the order or availability of old data. It would allow users to post for free using an Reddit like interface. It would allow subplebbit owners to moderate spam semi-automatically using their own captcha service over peer-to-peer pubsub. It would allow for all features that make Reddit addictive: upvotes, replies, notifications, awards, and a chance to make the &amp;amp;quot;front page&amp;amp;quot;. All this without any fears of illegal content as it wont allow any media hosting. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So technically, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://plebbit.eth.limo/&quot;&amp;gt;Plebbit&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; client developers to serve an unlimited amount of users, without any server, legal, advertising or moderation infrastructure. PLEB is their native token which will be used for the Plebbit similar to the what reddit does with it&amp;amp;#39;s community points if you will. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;His &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/plebbit/whitepaper/discussions/2&quot;&amp;gt;github&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; has been constantly updated for a while with a lot of work and he seems really dedicated. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I took some info from their &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@plebbit&quot;&amp;gt;Medium&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; article.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

According to kraken, when a deposit is sent on the Binance Smart Chain to a standard Ethereum address, the private keys would need to be exported and then imported into a Binance Smart Chain wallet in order to recover the funds. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However, this is not possible with their ERC-20 deposit addresses, as they are generated using smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Addresses generated this way don’t have private keys associated to them, therefore they have nothing to export.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Therefore, my money gone. Therefore, I am a fool. Dammit.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If this is the only thing developers of the project are forcing, targeting, then chances are high that you invested in a shitcoin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Not only that, but sometimes you will see a massive 50% burn immediately after the launch.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They will talk about great burning of 50% like it is the best thing in the world and the only &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;thing that matters in crypto.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With that they will also try to &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;hide their whales messing around with % of the coin ownership&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; (&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;for example on BSC scan, if you have 10m tokens and supply is 100m tokens, they burn 50%, BSC scan will show you as the owner of  10% while truth is you own much more then that. It is because BSC count the burn address in the pool aswell)&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I don&amp;amp;#39;t even know why do we keep calling it &amp;amp;quot;shitcoin&amp;amp;quot; when most of them are &amp;amp;quot;shitTOKENS&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now I am not saying that you are not able to make money with it, its your call and your decisions, not all of them are a rugpull. Also some legit projects are burning coins, but that is not the main thing of their project.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you plan to hold it long term, beware&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Obviously it&amp;amp;#39;s always nice to get some bonus and as it&amp;amp;#39;s free money you should definitely take it. But don&amp;amp;#39;t think that you will become rich due to it. Staking is just a way to expand your fortune, not change it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
