It&amp;amp;#39;s fascinating: according to her, 64 individuals controlled virtually all of the mining at that time, and they could easily have attacked the network, but chose not to.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This study raises questions about the decentralization of Bitcoin in its early years. We know that the community was much smaller back then, but it&amp;amp;#39;s impressive how tiny it was. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The scientist, Alyssa Blackburn, used &amp;amp;quot;leakage information&amp;amp;quot; to come up with this result. Here&amp;amp;#39;s how &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;The New York Times&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; reported her methods :&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Aggregating multiple leakages, Ms. Blackburn consolidated many Bitcoin addresses, which might have seemed to represent many miners, into few. She pieced together a catalog of agents and concluded that, in those first two years, 64 key players — some of whom were the community’s “founders,” as the researchers called them — mined most of the Bitcoin that existed at the time.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“What they figured out, just how concentrated early mining and use of Bitcoin was, that’s a scientific discovery,” said Eric Budish, an economist at the University of Chicago.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some might think this is bad news, but I disagree. For one thing, it proves that serious scientific researchers are interested in blockchain and its usefulness (by the way, Alyssa Blackburn herself says that she is cryptocurrency agnostic, and she says that her research can help make the network more decentralized).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It also shows how far we&amp;amp;#39;ve come since 2009. Today, it would be unthinkable that a single person - or a small group of people - could carry out a 51% attack against Bitcoin. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Finally, it proves that the early adopters cared about the health of the network.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Contrary to what no-coiners love to think, cryptocurrency and blockchain is a new and fascinating technology, and that study proves it. Real scientific progress is being achieved because of it. “The techniques used to extract information are interesting&amp;amp;quot;, said Jaron Lanier, a computer scientist. Studying blockchains lead to new techniques, which is a scientific progress.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What do you think about this discovery?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“I want to come clean, and I will likely tear a rift in the entire community while I&amp;amp;#39;m at it and on my way out.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Over the course of these next few weeks I will be releasing 137.21GB of Telegram group chats and messages, of which I was not a part of. Why? This is all thanks to an exploit in October of 2019 that allowed one to access the group page with recent messages if proper permissions were not set up. At the time of writing this, the team at Telegram have been contacted about this. I&amp;amp;#39;ve only ever seen two people mention this exploit in passing, one in person and one on Twitter, so I know I was not the only one.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Those who know me will know who I am very soon, for the rest of the populace it doesn&amp;amp;#39;t matter. Due to the overwhelming amount of messages, I formally invite reputable press within the community to reach out in order to obtain sample archives from groups I&amp;amp;#39;ve already curated. I will vet you because there is a conflict of interest as many are involved personally, whether being friends of those individuals in this archive or related financially in one way or another. You will receive the .7zip archive ahead of time but it will be password-protected until the 7th of July.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I have no further relationships with the people mentioned after this and will never be in contact with them in the future as of this moment.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Three years ago, a vulnerability on Telegram was discovered by a colleague of mine. He did not take it to its final outcome. By exploiting this, one could recreate an invite to view the overview page and recent messages of any Telegram group of an individual user without actually joining said group.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Between October of 2019 to May of 2022 I was collecting all messages as is in my data hoarding nature. I had written a script that downloads every message sent to any Telegram group with targetted individuals, you may know some of them as crypto influencers, while others targetted included many investors in the space. As Telegram adoption among crypto users began to grow, it began to become increasingly difficult to monitor all these group chats so I stepped away for a while and let the messages continue to download and be copied to my personal server.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For the most popular traders in the community, spying on them became a hobby. From personal events in their lives shared with their closest friend groups, to scams and rugpulls that were created on their way to success, financially and socially on Twitter. I felt like a part of it even though I had no method to interact with them. However, as they got rich, I got rich. I got myself into plenty of VC groups and soon my entire circle of friends and those I talked to became one and the same.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I did not care in the past, some of these people are looked up to in the ecosystem nowadays and the thought of these individuals commiting fraud would be dismissed in an instant. Some even moving on from their days of bygone scams under anonymous names with their groups of friends (while others continue to persist to this day).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Artists pretending to be developers, developers pretending to be artists. Those pretending to be rich, those pretending to be poor, pretending to be someone you&amp;amp;#39;re not. All of that was exposed to me. All of that was this community at its core when expressing themselves to the public, usually through Twitter.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I do not know what it is about Telegram, but the alleged assurance of privacy and security meant that people became relaxed and let them express themselves freely.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It doesn&amp;amp;#39;t matter to me anymore. I am dying from illnesses that are wreaking havoc on my body. Any money I made will just go on to my family, and I will disappear after that.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But not before this feeling of guilt is released from me.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Many of the individuals or projects I name will not survive this, either due to public backlash, financial fraud, or other obscure reasons such as embarrassment. Some may step down from their positions of power, others will likely ignore it as they can&amp;amp;#39;t claim the messages that are archvied are fraudulent unless everyone involved in the group chats are all on the same page.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There will be confusion, there will be sadness, there will be anger and there will be frustration. I am intrigued to see what happens next but I let everyone else decide how to proceed forward.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;June 15th will publish excerpts from:
- crypto influencers, ranging from as little as 800 followers to as much as 1M followers
- discussions pertaining to racism and homophobia, of adultery and sexual assault on members of the public and those within the crypto communities 
- those with 8-9 figures and high amounts of Twitter followers discussing rugpull projects, projects intended to scam the community and individuals, dating between Dec 2019 - Feb 2022
- killing and stealing the crypto of an individual with a group of friends (coordinated through telegram)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;June 30th:
- project creators in the top 200 mcap projects, from yield-farming projects, to stablecoins, to AMM&amp;amp;#39;s all designed from the start to siphon funds from the majority of users
- discussions of everything included from the crypto influencers
- invitation to orgies on private jets, in mansions, in VR settings, orgies everywhere
- sexual assault, rape, and pedophilia including pedophilic orgies with victims as young as 8 years old
- assassination, not once, not twice, but three times (coordinated through telegram)
- lots of adultery and weird obsessions with ex-girlfriends by gifting them millions in dollars hoping to get them to fall back in love with you (you know who you are, just let it go)
- asking twitter employees to personally delete and/or ban accounts relating to incriminating information&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;July 7th:
Everything will be released.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;e135846e2594f4ddb45abee1e27c8521329e440b9af77891a29ae54f8cd71bbc - 137.21GB .7zip titled &amp;amp;quot;CTGHistory&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Password will be provided and all messages on June 15th, 30th and July 7th will be available through a signed transaction at the following address: 0xdC56BCccf3fa51687f339E2425E9Bc1a2acB42Ee&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I don&amp;amp;#39;t require a PGP for verification. Twitter will likely take this message down, at the end of the day, I did what I could to undo the power and success granted to those that do not deserve it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To those in my life, I am sorry but this is what I decided. I hope you understand.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

In a recurring pattern, as published by Reuters investigation report, Binance has helped launder money originating from scams, hacks, investment frauds, illegal drug sales, a foreign exchange violation case among others in the last five years. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The U.S.  government also hired crypto researcher Chainalysis,  to monitor illegal flows, and it was reported that Binance received criminal funds totaling $770 million in 2019 alone, another report by Crystal Blockchain,  showed that a Russian-language site called Hydra, used Binance to make and receive crypto payments worth $780 million.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Reuters calculated from an examination of court records, statements by law enforcement and blockchain data, compiled for the news agency by two blockchain analysis firms. Two industry experts reviewed the calculation and agreed with the estimate.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Binance declined to make Zhao available for an interview. Responding to written questions, Chief Communications Officer Patrick Hillmann said Binance did not consider Reuters’ calculation to be accurate. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;He did not respond to requests to provide Binance’s own figures for the cases identified in this article.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; He said Binance was building “the most sophisticated cyber forensics team on the planet” and was seeking to “further improve our ability to detect illegal crypto activity on our platform.” &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I found that the same shop is now selling everything at almost double the price now compared to last few weeks. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I have been hearing about inflation and was aware of price increases (since I don&amp;amp;#39;t have a car, living in a big metro I was not directly impacted) but today was my real experience with these price increases in such a short span of time. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I have exposed and hedged myself from this with BTC but I feel it is not enough now.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I know I can still afford and be able to pay these prices. But I am so worried and sad that the poor sections of the society will basically find themselves not being able to buy anything if this continues like this. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is just sad. Very sad. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I try to bring awareness around me to why this is happening but all the people seems to not understand basic finance and there anger is directed towards government to provide help, give them more money as aid. This is the very problem &amp;amp;#39;more money&amp;amp;#39; which is equivalent to &amp;amp;#39;printer going brrrr&amp;amp;#39; -root cause of all problems. It almost seems we are in this death spiral and our generation will see worst of worst times in coming years. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I try to find optimism in pessimistic times in life but for the first time I feel there is only pessimism ahead of us. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My only hope is this project &amp;amp;quot;BTC&amp;amp;quot;. Only hope!!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: Nothing against any country or continent, but I am not from North America. Inflation is a global problem but when I read comments it is becoming too focused on US politics and to be honest I don&amp;amp;#39;t get the local references in your comments!!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Bi-partisan crypto bill&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; by the GOP&amp;amp;#39;s Cynthia Lummis and the Democrat&amp;amp;#39;s Kristen Gillinbrand (this is a person who voted against bailing out Wall Street &amp;amp;amp; banks circa 2008). The bill should be out this month, but probably won&amp;amp;#39;t get a vote until the 118th Congress begins next year. My belief is that after regulatory clarity, bitcoin will absorb TradFi and trust rapidly. Governments won&amp;amp;#39;t be able to control programmable money like this and it will run wild. Anything unfavorable in any bills will get programmed around and that&amp;amp;#39;ll be a wrap&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Taproot Support.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Praise the lord, because we already have 75%+ nodes supporting it, and Taproot addresses, signatures, and scripting are necessary to unleash the security and innovation we need to begin onboarding institutions, governments, and individuals en masse&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;TARO&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; (taproot asset representation overlay). This means stablecoins, products, services, NFT collectibles, tokenized securities, and anything else that you can assign value. It&amp;amp;#39;s difficult to stress the absurd liquidity and power this can bring the Bitcoin Network. All of this stuff will ultimately get settled in bitcoin. Why? Because bitcoin is a payment network that only bitcoin travels on. Meaning anything built on or traveling above bitcoin&amp;amp;#39;s base layer gets settled in BTC. This is how we &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;bitcoinize the dollar&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; flipping the dynamic we&amp;amp;#39;re so accustomed to on exchanges, where bitcoin is settled in US dollars. This will fire a major shot across the bow spurning a circular economy war. TARO is also cool because the upgrade to wallets is so minimal. Of course none of this is good news for centralized exchanges&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The Merge&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. This will set that protocol rapidly on its path towards centralization and self-immolation. Liquid staking derivative platforms will within 1 year acquire the network effects and stakes necessary to capture over 50% of the network and control it forever unless hard-forked, creating several problems itself because of L2, bridges, and sidechains obviously. If it&amp;amp;#39;s not a single platform acquiring the network, it will be two of them colluding. The decentralized autonomous organizations that run these platforms are made of TradFi and erstwhile hegemons. Expect them to utilize carry trades (low interest cash borrowing), use it to buy the crypto, stake it, and use their staking derivatives to short the crypto, creating near delta-neutral positioning. Remember, if you&amp;amp;#39;re not staking, you&amp;amp;#39;re being diluted by whatever the staking APY is. I suspect this inflation will match the USD&amp;amp;#39;s traditionally (4% or so). Just another reason why fixed monetary policy (bitcoin) and PoW are important&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;SEC regulation&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;: this means securities designations for much of the space which will damage centralized exchanges as much as VC&amp;amp;#39;s and (expletive)coins themselves. This is the s-curve adoption shakeout we bitcoiners have been warning about. It will help end the above system we talked about even faster&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Full-blown LiFi&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; (Lightning Finance). If I can send you bitcoin and you get stablecoins on the other end; or you send someone stablecoins and they get milk, then you can see how most people using the Bitcoin Network won&amp;amp;#39;t know they&amp;amp;#39;re using the network. They won&amp;amp;#39;t see or understand what&amp;amp;#39;s happening in the background anymore than they do Visa when buying a concert ticket, or HTTP when clicking through a website. You don&amp;amp;#39;t have to price things at the store in sats people. It doesn&amp;amp;#39;t matter what they&amp;amp;#39;re priced in. I can see several payment processors bypassing traditional discrete payment networks (like Visa or PayPal) and leveraging the LN. I expect banks, the traditional payment networks themselves, and even governments to use it. One major chartered bank is already in talks to issue fiat (not stablecoins, but digital fiat) on the LN. It&amp;amp;#39;s pretty cool to know the LN will connect everybody in the world, and to get started all that&amp;amp;#39;s needed is downloading a free wallet&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Hyperinflation.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; It&amp;amp;#39;s unavoidable. We&amp;amp;#39;re at the end of the debt cycle. The USD is trapped. You can&amp;amp;#39;t raise interest rates enough because the debt is too high (over $30T) making the interest paid too high. Foreign demand for Treasuries peaked years ago. Supply chains are broken, many for the rest of this decade. Energy inputs can&amp;amp;#39;t be reigned in, not just because of sanctions which cause an immediate impact, but because even when those are gone, the chronic underinvestment in exploration/extraction will take years to fix with proper investment (even if we made a sweetheart deal with Venezuela). And lastly, inflation is high everywhere you look. This is what Robert Triffin predicted back in the 1960s for an inflationary world reserve currency--an eventual doom vortex when the currency got trapped between low rates, inflation, debt, and falling foreign demand. Several countries have currencies which are more volatile than BTC is (Turkey, Iran, Argentina, Cuba, much of Africa, etcetera). Is Japan next? What I know is it&amp;amp;#39;s climbing the ladder, and when BTC is more stable than major currency pairs are, with longterm bias to the upside, we&amp;amp;#39;ll see a credit market rapidly develop around bitcoin collateral globally. Point is, the capital flight release valve in a hyper event is pretty obvious: Bitcoin. The USD isn&amp;amp;#39;t going away just yet, but stopping inflation doesn&amp;amp;#39;t mean prices go down, it simply means prices stop going up. Thankfully BTC will be there to do whatever you need it to do: issue new assets, collateralize, lend, borrow, save, send, or spend. The new global reserve asset&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Seriously though, this shit is going to disappear into the internet stack. And the sooner we&amp;amp;#39;re the internet of money, the sooner the price becomes apparent:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;∞/21M&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Conclusion: HODL. BUY. REPEAT.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The ponzi slowly unravelled during the Great Recession when investors started to want to withdraw funds, he wasnt able to keep up with the withdraw requests as he was now lacking funds. He eventually told his sons. They then reported it to the feds. He was then sentenced to 150 years in prison. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Whereas, in 2022, Do Kwon lost investors around 60billion (Luna and UST combined market value). And instead of answering questions/investigations or serving time. He created Luna 2.0 &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It baffles me how he has the guts/audacity to launch Lunacy two point zero. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For old luna bag holders / new comers thinking on “investing” on lunacy 2.0, I will leave you with a quote to think about.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“Fool me once , shame on you.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now I wonder if Do will ever see jail time? As south korean authorities are conducting investigations with regards to the collapse of both ust and luna. Plus allegations that Terraform Labs is being used to move/launder money.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;IMO, Luna 2.0 is a spit on the face to the unlucky ones who got duped by the “stablecoin” and a somewhat “conservative” 20% apy combo. The 20% is what I call “Good , but not that good to NOT be true” the perfect bait&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

But it&amp;amp;#39;s all playing out like the market wanted, nearly all hype investors seem to be gone. Only real investors with conviction in the tech or price action or whatever are remaining.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Such drastic declines in New investors who just hold for a few months are very good because the market is now getting settled up for the next leg upwards and is making space for those hype investors to once again return and buy at the ATH.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Currently only we are remaining here and if you made it this far you can definitely call yourself a long-term investor and also a Crypto Citizen. It definitely was not easy to come this far and you should not give up after coming this far too.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
