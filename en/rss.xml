&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Essentially, this has allowed them to tank the price for a week and continue to throw tiny breadcrumbs in the hope most users will forgive them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I am particularly fascinated by the introduction to re-stake before June 1 and keep all existing offers - because to be honest, I think most people were counting down the days until the they were free from their stake - and the peak of investors wads about to expire over the next three weeks. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The problem with that, is most people are down so they will have to invest more to re-stake at the ongoing rate. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Source from Twitter quoted below for reference. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;We&amp;amp;#39;ve been engaging with the community all week about card rewards, and we&amp;amp;#39;re making a few more updates based on your feedback&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The process has been far from ideal, but it&amp;amp;#39;s important to take your feedback into account, and deliver an attractive yet balanced offering.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;‚úÖ Ruby Steel cashback is increasing from .5% to 1%&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;‚úÖ Jade &amp;amp;amp; Indigo cashback is increasing from 1.5% to 2%&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;‚úÖ Current card rewards will be locked-in for six months if you re-stake before June 1, 2022&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;‚úÖ We will waive the card upgrade fee ($50) until further notice&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Once again, thank you to everyone who provided feedback üôè&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What is up with that, US? Why don&amp;amp;#39;t you like profits? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Could it be the blatant market manipulation with options and future? Is it the stock/bonds markets influencing BTC? Is it the interest hike somehow? What gives?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So 2 weeks ago I saw that my account is blocked, they don&amp;amp;#39;t let me trade and also withdraw my funds.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I asked for an official notice that all Russian citizens should be blocked, without the possibility of withdrawal.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I am a simple person, not connected in any way and not supporting the war in Ukraine. I created an account in 2019, verified it, confirmed the legal origin of the funds.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And now the exchange just wants to appropriate my money, referring to what is happening in Ukraine.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/u/BitStampOfficial/&quot;&amp;gt;u/BitStampOfficial&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; I ask you to provide legal notice on what basis you completely blocked my account, as well as many other accounts from Russia.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Why is no other exchange taking measures like yours?? Two weeks later, your support team cannot give me an answer, but is just playing for time. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;TICKET #BIT-1438832&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

According to court documents, he sold about 104 kilograms of MDMA, 566,000 ecstasy pills, four kilograms of cocaine and ‚Äúsubstantial quantities‚Äù of amphetamine, LSD, weed, ketamine and Xanax on the dark web website &amp;amp;quot;Silk Road&amp;amp;quot;. He was sentenced to 40 years in prison, but got a reduction after handing over his Bitcoin stash. People often remind him they could be worth billions now, but he always thought his freedom was more important. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the use of having a few hundred million euros if you‚Äôre in prison?‚Äù he said.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;BTC current price 39,800 x 380,000 = 15.1 billion &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Couple of questions here...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What does the US do with that BTC?
And would you sacrifice 30 years for 15 billion?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Background: how high are those Fed rates eventually gonna go and how big is the effect?&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s important to keep things in perspective.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Lowering or increasing rates, doesn&amp;amp;#39;t necessarily mean we&amp;amp;#39;ll have very high or very low rates.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In fact, Fed rates are only going up from a near 0 floor. We&amp;amp;#39;re not jumping from high rates to higher rates.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The long term plan by the Fed is to target around 2 -2.5%.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is far from being high rates. These are still low rates designed more to stimulate an economy. With cost of borrowing still not very expensive.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In fact, 2% is simply going back to 2020 rates and the pre-covid normal.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;The key points of the JPOW&amp;amp;#39;s meeting:&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;-0.5 fed hikes as expected, following the roadmap to 2%.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;-75 basis points moved off the table. This lowers a lot of uncertainty.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;-Unemployment at one of the lowest in 50 years.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;-Wages moving up.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;-According to JPOW, inflation has likely peaked, and expects it to go down.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;-The economy is &amp;amp;quot;not vulnerable to a recession&amp;amp;quot; and &amp;amp;quot;the economy is doing fairly well&amp;amp;quot; according to JPOW.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;-JPOW&amp;amp;#39;s tone has changed since the last meeting. From a somber dovish tone, to a more hawkish and optimistic tone.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;What does it mean for Bitcoin and ultimately crypto?&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The US has the biggest share of the Bitcoin market, so while this may seem very US-centric, what happens in the US could affect the crypto market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Probably not as much as most people would expect.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While the correlation between Bitcoin and US stocks has increased since Covid, it has only increased from nearly 0 and weak correlation, to only a moderate and inconsistent correlation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The correlation works more strongly, when the crypto market is already more vulnerable to move in that direction.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Right now, crypto has been testing lows, and may have been forming a bottom.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If stocks do well and go up, it could help boost crypto in going in the path of least resistance, which right now is up.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There is one important effect that should still affect the crypto market: liquidity.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Even if whales trading bots don&amp;amp;#39;t care about the cost of a car loan increasing, they do care about liquidity coming into the market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Additional data about the current state of the US economy:&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;US real GDP growth has decreased at a rate of about 1.4% this quarter.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Unemployment is down to 3.8%.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Consumer expenditure has increased 2.7% despite inflation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Residential investment has gone up 2%.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The trade gap has increased to $110 Billion.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Covid cases have been steadily rising this year to about 30K per day for the US. They are still much lower than last summer, and compared to the major part of 2021.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Conclusion:&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The policy remains the same: kicking the can down the road.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Don&amp;amp;#39;t bet the farm on a great depression just yet. It&amp;amp;#39;s possible, but... realize that it&amp;amp;#39;s not the only scenario at play. We are still at a tipping point where it could go either way.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We are still in a potential scenario where this was just a correction. Likely more due to the extra liquidity turned off, and liquidity getting more back to normal, and the market having to re-adjust to reality with no more extra money printed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So it&amp;amp;#39;s not completely out of the question that the stock market could eventually resume its run, as businesses re-open, supply chains unclog, economic growth picks up again, inflation stabilizes, and maybe even the war in Ukraine ends or becomes less uncertain.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If markets pick up again, that will be very good for bringing back liquidity into crypto, along with confidence. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For now, the more short term result of this meeting on crypto, the odds favoring going for the path of least resistance to test $40K again.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I was downvoted / shouted down for the crime of suggesting Bitcoin is somehow &amp;amp;quot;political&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yea yea, BiTcOiN iS aPoLiTiCaL. Meanwhile, Congress is encouraging the EPA to essentially boot Bitcoin from the United States.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I have my coins in Cold Storage and I understand the tech. I&amp;amp;#39;m not concerned about confiscation or my ability to spend/transfer. I am concerned about effectively living in China while not living in China at all. People on this sub keep insinuating Bitcoin is alive and well in Communist China, despite the CCP&amp;amp;#39;s clampdown... But I haven&amp;amp;#39;t seen many reputable sources to confirm this, so you&amp;amp;#39;ll have to pardon my skepticism. The recent letter to the EPA makes it clear that the current Democratic Congress in the United States is flirting with a CCP style agenda with respect to Bitcoin. That scares the hell out of me, and it should scare the hell out of you.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s becoming clear that IF the United States and Europe decide to go the way of China with regards to banning Proof of Work mining, then we Americans can all thank our local Democratic congressman or congresswoman for doing their part in our &amp;amp;quot;progress&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;PLEASE. Get out there and vote these banking-industry sluts out of office so that US citizens don&amp;amp;#39;t have to live under the CCP by proxy.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On February 1st 2021, I sent 10,000 USD to Bitfinex to lend out to margin traders, but the funds have not shown up in my account since. I have been in constant contact with Bitfinex support and my personal bank. The former keep giving me opaque excuses as to why my funds have not been credited to my account. Before they ‚Äòcouldn‚Äôt locate my funds‚Äô, now they claim to be able to see the funds but their bank ‚Äòisn‚Äôt replying‚Äô. They literally couldn‚Äôt care less about me and my funds. My bank have exhausted every option to attempt to recover my funds - they say that the receiving bank have been uncooperative. I have a letter from my personal bank confirming that the funds were successfully sent, and I have an ‚Äòofficial‚Äô letter from Adrian Capron at Deltec Bank &amp;amp;amp; Trust claiming that they have not received my funds (even though Bitfinex have since said they can see the funds).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is a warning to all - &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;stay away from Bitfinex, Tether, Deltec&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. It is also a call for help - does anyone have any suggestions as to how I can rectify this situation? Has this happened to anyone else recently? &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Any cross-community reposts would be greatly appreciated.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; I have seen similar cases where publicity has resulted in a resolution. I will not stop until I have my money back.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Since my funds vanished, I have looked into Bitfinex, Tether, and Deltec, it seems that Bitfinex have previously lost client funds, as their off-shore bank accounts were frozen by authorities for corporate fraud. Apparently Bitfinex kept client funds all in one commingled account. Then ensued cases of clients not being able to withdraw funds - Bitfinex&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/2021.02.17_-_settlement_agreement_-_execution_version.b-t_signed-c2_oag_signed.pdf&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;denied&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;this claim. I knew tether was not fully legit, but I wasn‚Äôt aware of really how fraudulent the organisations were.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The price action. The price action in Algorand has been shit. Part of that has been due to the accelerated vesting that occured once Algo hit its price target last year. Another common complaint that investors have is that Algorand is not focusing on marketing. However, in the past few weeks, we have seen a change from this. First the stunt Algorand Foundation pulled on Earth day. Now Algorand Foundation has partnered with the FIFA organisation for the upcoming men and women worldcup. Hopefully they would continue to take correct steps like this and positive price action would be observed. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyway, bear markets are the best time to accumulate and Algorand is one of the best, if not the best layer 1 solution. They have got lot of things which others are only promising to deliver and this seems like a good time to scoop up some. Not financial advise though and this could all be very risk as Bitcoin could continue to be in a free fall and keep on sucking all Alts dry. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

That&amp;amp;#39;s why now more than ever its crusial to stick to your strategy, make rational decisions and NOT fall for mind tricks and fallacies. And it&amp;amp;#39;s certainly not the time to abandon simple math!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We&amp;amp;#39;ve all heard of sunk cost fallacy, gambler&amp;amp;#39;s fallacy, survivorship bias, confirmation bias and the like.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now after seeing a bunch of bullshit twitter posts, 
I wanted to bring this one to your attention.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;DOT is 70% down from its ATH. Buy now it&amp;amp;#39;s the best risk/reward ratio you&amp;amp;#39;ll get ‚Äî can go only 30% down.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I don&amp;amp;#39;t have a problem with the DOT-buying part, I have a problem with this reasoning.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;1) No cryptocurrency is guaranteed to return to its all time high. It happened before. It may or may not happen in the future.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;2) There is always equal upside and downside potential. Always. From the moment you invest (even if the asset was one valued 3 times or 50 times more), the dollar value of your investment can go 30%, 70% or 90% up or down. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;So whenever you invest, it is still possible your $100 will turn into $50 or $10.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;3) Twitter and other social media is NOT where you seek financial advice.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyway, I hope you&amp;amp;#39;re doing fine. Buy, sell, do whatever you choose. Just make sure the decisions you make aren&amp;amp;#39;t based on false logic.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
