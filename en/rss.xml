But it&amp;amp;#39;s not. I firmly believe we will get better in the mid to long term.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But this is just reminding me of 2018 too much. Day after day, week after week, my portfolio is losing a few %. With no end in sight. And the reasons are pulled out of thin air. September slump, November shenanigans, Christmas shopping, you name it. Now in 2022, I&amp;amp;#39;m just waiting for the same ol&amp;amp;#39; sayings from 2018. Chinese new year, wall street bonuses, January to end, March madness, and whatever idiotic saying there was to explain something that cannot be explained.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now with the FED rates raised (and more rates raised foreseen), I just can&amp;amp;#39;t help but feel... defeated.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I didn&amp;amp;#39;t invest more than I&amp;amp;#39;m willing to lose. I will not suffer financially if I lose EVERYTHING I have in crypto. That said, does anyone here LIKE losing any money?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I know it&amp;amp;#39;s volatile. That&amp;amp;#39;s why I love crypto. But this seems like it has no end in sight. And it just smells like 2018 all over again. And I just fall into this slump of how I felt back then. 10-20% dump daily. Going on for days and weeks. BTC was down 80% from ATH. All other alts over 90% (yes, even ETH). It&amp;amp;#39;s terribly exhausting.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Maybe I&amp;amp;#39;ll feel better smack down in the middle of bear run. That way I know there&amp;amp;#39;s no other option but to buy/DCA and stake. But now... I&amp;amp;#39;m scared.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;EDIT: Thank you for the awards (really not necessary), kind words, words of re-assurance, people calling me female genitalia and whoever said to &amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;be scared more quietly&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;. That one made my day. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

If you are here for long term every correction is a huge opportunity we were asking for when market was extreme greed. I don’t know if it’s a bear market or not but I know it’s a good opportunity to buy low.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I try to never give investment/financial advice unless people directly ask for it, but of course when it comes to Bitcoin people are either fascinated or laugh it off. Is 0.28 still a number worth bringing up as an achievable goal for newbies?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yeah.. sure jan. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is such a horrible security practice that just doesnt need any explanation. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Definitely, nothing untoward can happen by entering your seed to login everytime.. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Oh wait.. they themselves prove how it could go horribly wrong.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Not only do you have to enter the seed, they are storing the seed in plaintext locally&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This horrendous security practice was noticed by user Nptacek. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The whole platform stinks tbh, if you go to their home page, its full of buy their shitcoin links instead of an actual social network. Decentralised social media networks like Mirror and GM already exist that do not have any token and can be used already. Mirror especially is growing in popularity as an alternative to Medium among crypto users. It doesnt have any token, and only uses Metamask to verify the authenticity of your account. For example Vitalik could verify himself with his ENS address. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Whereas DESO seems to be only interesting in pushing their token first and has a market cap of over $650m without even a functional product. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Why should I buy a token to use a decentralised social media network first?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Basically stocks become kind of a risky and uncertain assets while bonds become the opposite, safe haven, almost zero risk and guaranteed yield. That will eventually crash stocks/sp500 and so on. Understandably this means all huge institutional investors will take their money out of BTC. At best we are expecting another 2-3 to 4 year bear market before markets start to recover. BTC may as well go 10k under easily and stay there for a long time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On the other hand Jeff Booth and  Greg Floss may say that government can reduce money printing and improve bonds yields but that&amp;amp;#39;s just  temporary and eventually they will have to start printing lots of money again to avoid stock markets to crash because nobody wants that. Also they may say inflation is going to get worse and worse due to the money printing and the best bet against inflation is Bitcoin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But my opinion is that Bitcoin is not dependant on reddit users/bitcoin forums/youtube gurus etc. It&amp;amp;#39;s dependant on the big money! And big money is controlled mostly by people who consider BTC a very risky asset! (of course with the exceptions of Saylor, Cathie Wood and the early BTC Whales who have diamond hands for lifetime)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So I&amp;amp;#39;m thinking who exactly is going to put a lot of money in Bitcoin in a market crisis where stock are going down by 50% and more in a couple of weeks/months. Who is going to risk it? Also is US Government really able to prevent another mega stock market crash? Nasdaq Composite Index is currently at all time highs up around 600% from 2010!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All those unrealised gains, lost. Everything that was once beautiful flourishing green, is red like the blood of a slaughtered goat.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I considered selling some of my gains at the top, but I was too greedy. I wanted more. Had I taken some profits, I would&amp;amp;#39;ve had the opportunity to buy in at much lower prices.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;What am I going to do?&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m still HODLing.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; But I&amp;amp;#39;ve decided during the next bull run, I will take profit &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;(nothing massive, the initial investment or less)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; and hold those funds in wait for a significant dip. The dips do come and will come and I think it really benefits your mental health to be able to take some amount of profit.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“The ignorance of the majority is your opportunity.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There are corporations and nations adopting it. This is bigger than any sights I saw of Bitcoin’s potential of success ten years ago, so I’m even more excited about its future now than I was then buying the dips and subscribing to this model of though. So take advantage and buy while the world is ignorance. All this now means today is that you’re still plenty early.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When Bitcoin’s drops are only ten percent from its all time highs, that’s when you know you’ll be late ish and it’s returns long term will be no where near where it’s long term returns are today&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Having this constant paranoia and fear of sending crypto to wrong addresses, I decide to look up the address he sent to me on etherscan, and I find quite a large balance with many transactions. I make a joke to my friend about how rich he was, but he tells me that he has a 0 balance. That was when the alarm bells started going off in my mind. I ask him to take note of the first two and last two characters in his ethereum address, copy it, and then paste it to me. He tells me the address changed when it was pasted from the windows clipboard. To be double sure, I ask him to make up a random set of numbers and letters of length 42, then copy and paste it in our chat.The fake addressthat was pasted changed.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;My suspicions were right.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In short, his computer was infected by the colormania malware that targets the windows clipboard. This malware checks whether a copied text has a particular length that is common to some blockchains and replaces the text or address, in this case, with the attacker&amp;amp;#39;s address. So when you hit paste and click the send button, the address changes and the funds are sent to the attacker instead. We found evidence of the malware at the task manager&amp;amp;#39;s background processes. And lo and behold, we found colormania running in there. I had him download and install Malwarebytes, which found several threats on his system and cleared it. Now, the values of addressed copied onto the clipboard no longer changed when he pasted them. I guess the moral of this is to double check addresses whenever sending cryptocurrency.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Always stay paranoid&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is one of the attacker&amp;amp;#39;s ethereum address: 0x51e199f1ec3030B4610007C29ab3D272af91Dfd6&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Richard Heart, aka Richard J. Schueler, aka, J. Richard, aka James Hart is linked to a Panama criminal network which included corrupt lawyers and judges.
Heart also sold anti-aging cures in between roles as Spam King and Bitcoin thought leader.
Richard Heart, founder of controversial cryptocurrency project HEX (HEX), has been outed as a former internet scammer and ‘Spam King’.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://techtelegraph.co.uk/crypto-hex-founder-is-actually-notorious-criminal-spam-king/&quot;&amp;gt;https://techtelegraph.co.uk/crypto-hex-founder-is-actually-notorious-criminal-spam-king/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Heart now charades as a thought leader in the cryptocurrency space, but while Satoshi Nakamoto was working on Bitcoin, Heart was hocking anti-ageing remedies.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Methuselah Foundation, for which Heart apparently volunteered, is committed to extending the human lifespan and “making 90 the new 50”. The video below shows Heart in between his spells as Spam King and crypto thought leader.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://cryptotraderspro.com/hex-founder-outed-spam-king/&quot;&amp;gt;link&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The cryptocurrency’s official website even claims that the asset is “designed for 10,000x returns,” something that even the SEC would say fails their Howey test, which helps investors determine if an investment is too good to be true and may be a scam.
 &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newsbtc.com/news/why-this-developer-of-the-controversial-hex-cryptocurrency-accused-of-scam-left/&quot;&amp;gt;link&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Most recently, a Reddit user pointed out that 800 Ether tokens were withdrawn from the wallet used to store the proceeds from HEX token sale, and 770 Ether were sent to two crypto exchanges - Binance and Bitfinex.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/exit-scam-500-eth-from-hex-ico-wallet-liquidated/amp/&quot;&amp;gt;link &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The list goes on and on and on. All of the articles saying it isn&amp;amp;#39;t a scam are clearly paid for, the only SEO ranking against the coin is Reddit, luckily you can&amp;amp;#39;t pay for Reddit rankings. Hex even run a site saying they&amp;amp;#39;re not a scam, lmao imagine if any other coin did this? Massive red flags.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However, since joining this sub my Crypto portfolio is definitely performing a lot better than it was beforehand. Yes, this is largely due to this being a major hub for crypto news, but advice I’ve been given by others on here has definitely helped me out too. Here are some of the best pieces of advice I’ve been given:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;BTC/ETH should make up around 70% of your portfolio&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Staking as a method of passive income&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Earning free BAT through the Brave browser&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;How to set up a hard wallet, and why I should&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Importance of understanding Tokenomics&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;2 of my top 5 gainers this year were introduced to me through this sub (won’t name as this isn’t a shill post)&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This sub definitely isn’t all that bad, and there are some very smart people in here. What’s the best piece of advice you’ve been given on this sub?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;EDIT: Some great mentions in the comments that I feel should be highlighted in the main body (as I know some won’t bother to read the comments)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Don’t invest more than you can afford to lose&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I 10x&amp;amp;#39;d my money investing into ATOM, SYS, HOT, LUNA, LRC etc. and I was way over the moon. I thought I was fucking invincible... &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I was going around suggesting people to set stop limits, do not invest more money than you can afford and of course, I shilled for coins that I held. I had this baseless stupid confidence that comes with the money that I never had before.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then came 2022... I was talking with my friends about decent coins they can potentially invest in and the topic of leverage came up. We talked about the potential money I could earn, calculated the amount I&amp;amp;#39;d have if the coin I invested in mooned and then after dreaming about what I can do with the money I can potentially earn, it got to me... why not try out leverage on Binance and went right into 3x leverage. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I didn&amp;amp;#39;t even bother checking the interest rate, I forgot about all the principles I had with coin trading and borrowed the maximum amount and went all in. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I don&amp;amp;#39;t fucking know what got to me. Hype threads that talk about potential moon, people around me asking for advice, the money that I never had before... I&amp;amp;#39;d have held through the drop if this was just normal trading because I believe that it will always bounce back and maybe even go even further but with leverage... I cannot afford to hold. If whatever coin I buy drops even for a little bit I am left with no money and no way of earning what I lost back.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now, I sold all the coins I owned for BUSD and I am on the brink of liquidation at margin level of 1.14. The interest rate is piling up, I barely slept last few days and I am literally sweating due to anxiety. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I just wanted a place where I can vent about my stupidity. Thanks for reading... or not reading. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;*&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;tl;dr i am confident. i touch leverage. coin market goes boom. i am broke and fucked beyond measure. *&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;** point: don&amp;amp;#39;t touch leverage unless you have enough that you can use money as a toilet paper. **&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Staking on DeFi, Liquidity Pools, Yield Farming, DeFi Swaps can be headache dealing with even for intermediate crypto users let alone complete newbies. Additionally it&amp;amp;#39;s full of scammers, trying to scam vulnerable new users and drain their wallets.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In this line of thought i think that it&amp;amp;#39;s completely OK for anyone to use CeEx as long as he is comfortable with it. Using Centralized Exchange should not be a reason for criticism and blame. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Not your keys not your Crypto, sure, but isn&amp;amp;#39;t it better than no Crypto at all?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We often say &amp;amp;#39;&amp;amp;#39;moonboys never learn&amp;amp;quot;. Let me hit you with some facts:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Nov 2013. Bitcoin hits ATH of 1154$ and corrects to 227$ in Aug 2015. hitting new ATH Apr 2017.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Dec 2017. ATH of 19500$, corrects to 3300$ in Jan 2019. hitting new ATH Dec 2020.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Nov 2021. ATH of 69000$.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What have we learned? It takes around 2 years from ATH to hit bottom, and 2 more years to hit new ATH. And corrections are around 80%.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Retail and Industry are now heavily involved in cryptocurrency‘s, it went mainstream last year, The richest man in the world openly share the fact they HODL. I helped my mother set her account up last month! This is not the same space anymore.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;/u/Jxntb733&quot;&amp;gt;u/Jxntb733&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; is 2y old account and surely wasn&amp;amp;#39;t here in 2018. when McAfee said bubbles are mathematically impossible in this new financial paradigm. People also said Bitcoin is now too big to be a bubble. That&amp;amp;#39;s like the biggest red flag in bubbles, when people claim that something is too big to fail. You know, like Dot com bubble was too big to explode, 2008. housing market, and now crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyways, what&amp;amp;#39;s exactly different then 2018? People still use crypto for one and only purpuse: to watch it grow in fiat value. Also, different is that now we have modern day Tulip mania called NFT&amp;amp;#39;s, we have rupulls, awful memecoins, and more scams. I haven&amp;amp;#39;t seen bigger adoption then 4 years ago. Also, should I mention Tether printing usdt without any backing? Blockchain still haven&amp;amp;#39;t founded a single problem to solve since 2018. All I see is hype, new shitcoins, new NFTs, new scams, talks is still only about price, gains, profits. I&amp;amp;#39;m sorry but Bitcoin is no better then 5 years ago.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now, after this snap back to reality, I just want to say that&amp;amp;#39;s completely ok if Bitcoin hits 20k or even 10k before next rally to 100k in this decade. You just need to be rational with your money and patient. I belive in cryptocurrencies in long run. Stay safe and hydrated bros.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

And of course you guys are upvoting this.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That&amp;amp;#39;s garbage. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gapminder.org/answers/how-many-are-rich-and-how-many-are-poor/&quot;&amp;gt;A billion people have less than 1 USD a day&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. Those that have a bit more than that are not exactly rich either. There are millions of homeless people around the world, many of which don&amp;amp;#39;t have access to the internet to buy crypto - and none of which have money to do so. There are so, so many people in the world who cannot afford to buy enough food, pay rent, or other important commodities, and many more who can barely do so but have nothing left in their bank account at the end of the month. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Those people are definitely too poor to buy crypto&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sure, don&amp;amp;#39;t get me wrong, if you get by and only have a few bucks each month to gamble away, you&amp;amp;#39;re not too poor to buy crypto, you can just buy small amounts and it&amp;amp;#39;s fine. But saying &amp;amp;quot;Nobody is “too poor” to invest&amp;amp;quot;, as one of the commenters did, is just arrogant - and blatantly wrong.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Edit: please stop telling me that this is also true for other investments. Of course it is. My point is that people like to pretend while this is true for other investments, the barrier is so low for crypto that it isn&amp;amp;#39;t true for crypto. I&amp;amp;#39;m not saying crypto is more exclusive than other investments, I&amp;amp;#39;m saying it isn&amp;amp;#39;t really more inclusive&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Here are 5 top crypto strategies worth noting. Good Luck!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Day Trading&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;  - As a digital asset investor, you should be familiar with various resources and strategies. Basically, there are two types of trading strategies you can choose from. Active, which requires more time and attention and involves constant monitoring, and passive, which allows for a more hands-off approach.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Trend Tading&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; - One of the active strategies, trend trading, also sometimes known as position trading, is a tactic in which an investor will hold their position for a longer span of time, usually a few months. If you choose to be a trend trader, you need to keep up with directional trends and know how to take advantage of them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Scalping&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; - The last active strategy on our list is scalping, which focuses on small moves repeated over and over again and taking advantage of inefficiencies in the market such as gaps in liquidity. Scalpers open and close their positions in a short period of time, sometimes even in a matter of seconds.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;HODL&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; - If none of the active strategies seem like something you would be interested in, you might explore passive ones such as the buy and hold strategy. In this strategy, investors purchase a large sum of assets and hold it for a long time without paying attention to market fluctuations.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Index Investing&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; - Finishing off with another passive investment strategy, index investing focuses on buying ETFs, which you can purchase on centralized cryptocurrency exchanges. You can create a crypto index by creating a basket of all of your assets and then making a special token that will track their combined performance.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Stage 4: People are now confident that it will definitely be going lower and will always go lower, the crypto dream is dead and so is the stock market. Everything is ruined. Other times the market has gone down get referenced constantly. The phrase &amp;amp;#39;crypto winter&amp;amp;#39; starts being repeated frequently.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Stage 5: EVERY question gets answered with &amp;amp;#39;we don&amp;amp;#39;t know shit about fuck&amp;amp;#39;. Some people start commenting &amp;amp;#39;go outside and touch grass&amp;amp;#39; to every post no matter the context.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How did a fukin hamster was able to bit your average crypto investors ? What&amp;amp;#39; the secret ?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Just look at the reactions of most cryptonuts of this sub during the ongoing market carsh and you will find your answer.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A hamster can&amp;amp;#39;t read and so doesn&amp;amp;#39;t know anything about bull markets, bear markets or crab markets. Unlike humans their investment process is not emotionally hampered by the fear and greed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hamsters are not suceptible to FUD fear, uncertainty and doubt. They are not going to YOLO their lifesavings to buy a pupcum coin at ATH because of FOMO.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Unlike most of us hamsters don&amp;amp;#39;t buy high and sell low because of FOMO and fear.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Be like a hamster and free yourself from the emotions caused by regular checking charts and watching too much YouTube influencers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You know that having a good strategy and following it religiously is the only way that can do better than a fookin hamster.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Many of my colleagues, friends and others alike have told me they&amp;amp;#39;ve tried a ton of different apps to get into crypto and it&amp;amp;#39;s been difficult. The apps ask for a lot of info, there&amp;amp;#39;s a ton of charts, random numbers, obscure percentages, plenty of colorful logos... Even though I know exactly what they&amp;amp;#39;re referring to, it&amp;amp;#39;s overwhelming for them to hear me explain the fundamentals of private keys, public keys, liquidity pools, volatility, yield, hodling, DeFi, staking, gas fees, minting, tokens—among many others. We simply cannot expect wide-scale adoption for even one billion people if they need to know what all these mean.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Product designers in crypto have done a good job at translating the needs of the software engineers and the needs of their respective organizations, but only a few companies have focused on effortless user-friendly experiences. Some have come close ((which I do applaud them!)), but compare the design of popular crypto apps to that of popular apps in other categories; eg. Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, Messenger. These companies have honed their experience design to accommodate all types of people globally (regardless of their differences). Those who have no knowledge of how a story works, or how a message is sent, or how to find an album, can easily hop on to these apps and figure it out in seconds. This experience design has developed so strongly over the years that they&amp;amp;#39;ve found ways to keep user&amp;amp;#39;s eyes glued to their screens for hours on end. Some design aspects even become part of popular culture, like Tinder&amp;amp;#39;s swipe left or swipe right.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We&amp;amp;#39;re currently at peak &amp;amp;#39;hype&amp;amp;#39; levels with Web3 and DeFi. Even though I love the idea of it taking over, I don&amp;amp;#39;t believe it&amp;amp;#39;s ready for the scale we want it to be. We&amp;amp;#39;re going to need top-tier design strategies. Do consider that there are still people in the present day that struggle to do basic tasks on their computer or phone—and I&amp;amp;#39;m pretty sure we&amp;amp;#39;ve all met plenty before—we need to design for people like this in mind. I&amp;amp;#39;m an Android guy personally, but Apple has done exceptionally well in product design that flows throughout its ecosystem of apps and devices. It&amp;amp;#39;s straightforward and gets the job done. Yes there are questionable hiccups here and there, but for the most part, it&amp;amp;#39;s pretty seamless and it works for the masses. These are models we should follow.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Good design is beautiful but &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;great&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; design is invisible.
The moment a person has to pause &amp;amp;amp; search up how to do something in an app, that immediately decreases their interest &amp;amp;amp; their long-term retention. Invisible design shows that a user can get their tasks done without having to focus in on individual elements.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Essentially, I want to get to the point where I can suggest a friend, colleague or a family member a crypto app and I don&amp;amp;#39;t have to explain anything to them, they&amp;amp;#39;ll be able to figure everything out within minutes after downloading. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And for the note I like the simplified approach of Strike. It&amp;amp;#39;s visually bland but it succeeds its goal. It&amp;amp;#39;s had extreme success in El Salvador, where less fortunate communities use Bitcoin for daily transactions. Truly an app where no special prior knowledge is needed. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Open to your thoughts, please let me know if there&amp;amp;#39;s anything I missed or touched on in an odd way.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The fact is nobody knows what will happen. The market could continue to go sideways for months, or it could shoot back up or completely crash in an hour. Looking at former cycles doesn&amp;amp;#39;t help us all that much; nothing is guaranteed to repeat itself. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The sub is a great source of entertainment but it is the worst place for advice. People like to pretend they know what will happen - and I think some really think they know it and are telling that to themselves - because they read it in the stars (and call it technical analysis) or just look at some metrics that support their claims and ignore others. Don&amp;amp;#39;t believe them, nobody knows anything.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;tl;dr: nobody knows shit about fuck, don&amp;amp;#39;t believe anyone who pretends they do.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is common in smaller communities, but there are 4 million+ subscribers here. You’d expect posts on the frontpage would have a couple thousand upvotes instead of a few hundred each.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I dug into the numbers to check if it’s true.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;I exported our top 100 posts and compared the upvotes-to-comments ratio to subreddits that share our hobby of yolo-ing life savings because a stranger told us to&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That&amp;amp;#39;s Wallstreetbets and SuperStonk.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I scraped &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/bt09arh&quot;&amp;gt;data from 300 posts in the last 30 days&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; into a javascript object notation (JSON) file. Then I converted it into CSV format to find the headers that contained the info I needed: post title, upvote count, comment count, post type, flair, and a few others.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After that, it was just a matter of &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/ooakgfR&quot;&amp;gt;cleaning it up in Excel&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and making some pivot tables to combine data from all 3 subreddits.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Result 1: Users of Cryptocurrency give massively less upvotes than Wallstreetbets and SuperStonk&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And it’s not even close. Here’s a summary of all 300 posts I scraped:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;4,286,758&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;455,146&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;3.37&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;Wallstreetbets&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;11,449,899&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;2,170,981&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;23.98&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;SuperStonk&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;720,403&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;1,734,892&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;69,300&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;25.03&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/tbody&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/table&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;Table&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;formatting&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;brought&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;to&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;you&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;by&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://xl2reddit.github.io/&quot;&amp;gt;ExcelToReddit&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You are &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;612% more likely to get an upvote in Wallstreetbets&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; or Superstonk than on Cryptocurrency.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Other revealing stats are:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;We have 62% less subscribers than Wallstreetbets, but Cryptocurrency has 49% more comments&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Superstonk has 83% less subscribers, but they give 281% more upvotes than Cryptocurrency&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A high upvote-to-comment ratio means that there are more upvotes than comments. A &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;low ratio means users comment more&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; than upvote.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Result 2: If you look at SELFPOSTS ONLY, Cryptocurrency also gives way less upvotes than anywhere else&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Memes are allowed in both Wallstreetbets and SuperStonk which tend to be more upvote-heavy than comments.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you exclude those, this is what you get:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;table&amp;gt;&amp;lt;thead&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;th align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;th align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;Total Upvotes&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;th align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;Total Comments&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;th align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;Upvote-to-Comment Ratio&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/thead&amp;gt;&amp;lt;tbody&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;Cryptocurrency&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;325,455&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;115,203&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;2.83&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;Wallstreetbets&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;102,821&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;12,588&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;8.17&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;SuperStonk&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;392,629&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;19,136&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;20.52&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/tbody&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/table&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Your selfpost is still 189% more likely to get an upvote in Wallstreetbets, and 625% more likely in SuperStonk.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Result 3: We also give out less post appreciation awards than other subreddits&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Superstonk is way ahead at an insane 221 awards per post, then WSB is next with 65.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cryptocurrency is last with an average of 51 awards.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;table&amp;gt;&amp;lt;thead&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;th align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;th align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;# of Posts&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;th align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;Total Awards Given&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;th align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;Avg Awards per Post&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/thead&amp;gt;&amp;lt;tbody&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;Cryptocurrency&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;100&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;5,083&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;51&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;Wallstreetbets&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;100&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;6,459&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;65&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;SuperStonk&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;100&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;22,066&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;221&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/tbody&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/table&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This counts all awards: reddit gold, silver, helpful, facepalm, wholesome etc.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Conclusion/TLDR&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cryptocurrency is the Scrooge McDuck of upvotes. We like leaving comments a lot, but we don’t upvote the post we’re commenting on as often.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Why though?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But what caught my attention more than anything was all the people whining and complaining how they &amp;amp;#39;wished&amp;amp;#39; they had bought in when BTC was in the low 40s and how they had missed that glorious opportunity. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Well fellas... its time to put up or STFU cause that time is today. But judging by things around here I am guessing the modus operandi is going to be more and more whining, this time about how they &amp;amp;#39;wished&amp;amp;#39; they had sold. And then a couple of weeks or months from now when the market recovers (as it always does) we&amp;amp;#39;ll have the same people whining about how they missed that golden opportunity of buying low yet again.. no wonder we have that prophetic joke about buying high and selling low. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I think its about time to disrupt that problematic pattern of behavior.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
