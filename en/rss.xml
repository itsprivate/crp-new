&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After posting more than $3 billion of losses since its initial public offering in late July, Robinhood’s shares have plunged more than 80%, cutting its market capitalization to as low as $5.99 billion. The firm had $6.19 billion of cash and cash equivalents at the end of the first quarter. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Two words that describe this nicely:  Poetic Justice.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This company is SO worthless that it has a NEGATIVE value when you take out all its cash.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

That maximum damage is still yet to come.  Nobody on this sub or anywhere else for that matter actually knows where the price will go.  If it&amp;amp;#39;s so obvious that bitcoin is going below 10k, why aren&amp;amp;#39;t you shorting it right now?  Why haven&amp;amp;#39;t you sold everything you have?  Why aren&amp;amp;#39;t the people who are far more knowledgeable, experienced and invested than you dumping since it&amp;amp;#39;s so obvious that BTC is going to 10k?  Seems like an easy way to profit, since it&amp;amp;#39;s so certain, right?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s not.  We could have already hit bottom.  Truth is, nobody knows.  Even if we aren&amp;amp;#39;t at the bottom yet, here&amp;amp;#39;s the fate of 99% of investors on this sub:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; BTC drops further.  &amp;amp;quot;This isn&amp;amp;#39;t maximum damage yet.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; BTC drops further.  You don&amp;amp;#39;t buy because you&amp;amp;#39;re too afraid that if you do, it will dip more.  You&amp;amp;#39;re afraid that it&amp;amp;#39;s not the bottom yet.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; BTC drops to staggering lows, everyone is panicking, articles doomsaying the end of crypto are published, the suicide hotline is pinned.  Looks damn close to the bottom.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; You don&amp;amp;#39;t buy, because now you&amp;amp;#39;re afraid this is the end of crypto as we know it.  The rug has been pulled, everything is going to zero.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Crypto rallies and begins surging in price.  It multiples in value several times before you can react.  &amp;amp;quot;It&amp;amp;#39;s just a dead cat bounce&amp;amp;quot; you think, or some other stupid shit like that.  So you continue to be afraid, and you don&amp;amp;#39;t buy.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Crypto is up 5-10x from the bottom and you FOMO in on the way up.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Institutions dump on you again.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Once a big short starts to exit nobody wants to be the last guy out the door so other shorts pile in and since shorts close by buying suddenly you see big buying volume coming in. This is where people get in trouble because if you are not experienced with a bear market you may see this heavy buying and think “oh no I missed the bottom” and fomo in. Meanwhile the following week the short gets back from his tropical vacation and sees a nice 20% uptick on the back of dumb money retail and gets back to business. If the market suddenly rallies always ask yourself “has something fundamentally changed that would cause everyone to suddenly pile in here?”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The truth is that it will go lower until the inflation gets under control. I know is weird, the inflation should help crypto’s case not work against it but looking at the bigger picture will help understand the situation.    &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The FED at the moment is pumping the value of the USD by continuously raising interest rates and by that effect lowering the value of everything that is paired against the dollar. It’s not more complicated than that. Once inflation will be brought down to normal levels and the quantitive tightening will stop, then the other assets can catch a break and return to normal.    &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yes there is the option where they can’t control the inflation and people will lose faith in the dollar in which case everything will explode in value but honestly when one of the world’s biggest economy will go through hyperinflation, half of the other nations would be absolutely ruined. The Euro and GBP are burning to the ground at the moment and it’s making the USD more of a safe space than ever to have your money in.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So basically it’s a matter of economic stability more than Bitcoin’s price.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/kiyhmtfrpq591.png?width=413&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=f3ba7812ee2104c63d2bb2eb295dd0282c6a0f84&quot;&amp;gt; 6/15/22 - 69 down from 69 day &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So many comments on these subs at the end of 2021 and early &amp;amp;#39;22 from so many people wishing they had got in at a lower price. Well here is your opportunity.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You&amp;amp;#39;ll see many comments such as &amp;amp;#39;Don&amp;amp;#39;t catch a falling knife&amp;amp;#39;, or &amp;amp;#39;It&amp;amp;#39;s still dropping, and could drop to $10k or $5k, so wait until then&amp;amp;#39;, &amp;amp;#39;Don&amp;amp;#39;t be a fool buying now&amp;amp;#39;, &amp;amp;#39;Take your losses and run&amp;amp;#39;, &amp;amp;#39;Come back in later&amp;amp;#39;, etc. However, purchase small amounts often (or stack free satoshis from sites now offering more as the price drops), ignore the noise &amp;amp;amp; FUD, and stick to your &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;long term&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; plan.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Will you regret buying small amounts often in 10 or 20 years time when you look back to this year and see how many sats you stashed up?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;If Bitcoin goes to zero, it&amp;amp;#39;s not the end of the world and shouldn&amp;amp;#39;t be the end of your investments (diversify), and don&amp;amp;#39;t invest money you can&amp;amp;#39;t afford to lose.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;If Bitcoin goes to $100k, $500k, or more in the next 10 years, you won&amp;amp;#39;t regret it, and obtaining one bitcoin/BTC will become only obtainable by millionaires.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Remember most of us didn&amp;amp;#39;t get in early, but that doesn&amp;amp;#39;t necessarily mean you have missed out.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Happy Down 69 from 69 day&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Obligatory &amp;amp;quot;I&amp;amp;#39;ve been in the space for a while and seen a few things.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;First and foremost, people are exiting out of Tether. This isn&amp;amp;#39;t a normal retail exit. When someone exchanges USDT for USDC, for example, on an exchange, that&amp;amp;#39;s not a real exit of USDT. The chart below shows that since May 2022, there have been billions of USDT being exited into cash. In May, the market cap of Tether (i.e., the total supply) sat at $83B. Today, it sits at $70B. So there is $13B tether liquidated from the market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/mfrr64jdup591.png?width=1916&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=bcd64df8e693ca65f126f3980b7f06911b5a2413&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/mfrr64jdup591.png?width=1916&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=bcd64df8e693ca65f126f3980b7f06911b5a2413&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The problem with this $13B liquidation though, originates at the source of this &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://assets.ctfassets.net/vyse88cgwfbl/4EtXPBkmEPDNbIHNajz9vQ/bb4766acfe36f5af0c4e54a2694c8a31/tether-march-31-2021-reserves-breakdown.pdf&quot;&amp;gt;report published by Tether&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, stating that only 2.94% of its reserves are in cash. The pie chart in that document is a bit misleading -- it says 3.87%, but it is 3.87% of the 75.85% category of &amp;amp;quot;Cash &amp;amp;amp; Cash Equivalents &amp;amp;amp; Other Short Term Deposits &amp;amp;amp; Commercial Paper.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That report was published on March 31, 2021. At that time, the market cap of Tether was ~$62B (see chart below). 2.94% of that is $1.8B. We can also play out a second scenario: assume the cash reserves grew in tandem with the market cap. If that&amp;amp;#39;s the case, then at $83B, $2.4B would be in cash reserve.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/vju5zl19wp591.png?width=1916&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=a8c87c7a90edb13490d92c16b74f56c3aa9dd5e1&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/vju5zl19wp591.png?width=1916&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=a8c87c7a90edb13490d92c16b74f56c3aa9dd5e1&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Regardless of whether we take the $1.8B or $2.4B as true, those are both peanuts compared to the $13B liquidated from Tether in the past month. In fact, the liquidations would be 5.3x to 7.1x more than what Tether has in supposed cash reserves. To be able to account for this liquidation with actual cash, Tether would need to have 16% of its reserve in cash. I doubt it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So in my opinion, I now assume that Tether is dry of its cash reserves. This is where things start to get sticky. We can categorize their holdings into three categories: liquid, short-term, and long-term:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Liquid is basically cash (2.94%). These are things Tether can reach for to cover the cash people are asking for when they exit from Tether immediately. As I just talked about, my assumption is they&amp;amp;#39;re out of this.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Short-term is stuff they can potentially liquidate quickly (potentially at a penalty, so the value is not 1:1 necessarily) if they really need to, in order to cover the cash people are still asking for after they run out of liquid. We assume that 72.9% of Tether&amp;amp;#39;s supply (78.85% - 2.94%) can be categorized as this although &amp;amp;quot;short-term&amp;amp;quot; in this case is really subjective. Out of this 72.9%, I assume that USDT has already dipped into ~13% (16% - 2.94%). So approximately 60% is left over.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Long-term is everything else: 24.15% (100% - 75.85%). These are things that just can&amp;amp;#39;t really be liquidated easily except at extreme penalty. Also to note, out of the 24.15% we can safely assume the &amp;amp;quot;other investments&amp;amp;quot; category of 1.64% is probably useless and less than 1.64% now because 1) it includes investments in crypto, and 2) the crypto market has crashed. These could be illiquid investments into projects that don&amp;amp;#39;t have tokens on the secondary market yet, or they could be other cryptoassets, which probably will come at a significant premium if liquidated quickly (we don&amp;amp;#39;t know how much of these investments are liquid or illiquid, but either way we can say that it&amp;amp;#39;s fairly useless in this market). If Tether needs to tap into the long-term category, it&amp;amp;#39;s already pretty much game over.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And the name of the game is bank run. Bank run on an unsustainable model destroyed Luna/Terra, and bank run can destroy Tether as well. For those that don&amp;amp;#39;t know, a bank run happens when people all run to the bank to cash out at the same time. The bank doesn&amp;amp;#39;t have enough cash to give to everyone, which causes more panic and more people demanding to cash out. Ultimately, trust in the currency is lost, and people start cashing out at lower market value, tumbling the value of the currency into oblivion.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The bank run for Tether would begin as what looks like normal withdrawals, which can be covered by its liquid assets. This would be a 1:1 exchange. Based on my back-of-the-napkin math explained above, I believe the liquid assets are exhausted. Now Tether is tapping into its short-term assets. Some of these may come at a slight cost to liquidate (market volatility, penalties, etc.). This would not be a 1:1 exchange, so Tether needs to liquidate a bit extra to cover everyone who&amp;amp;#39;s asking for a dollar. I don&amp;amp;#39;t believe the short-term assets are all exhausted yet, so Tether can continue to carry this charade for a bit longer. In the event that people start to liquidate more USDT, then Tether will exhaust its short-term assets and have to tap into its long-term assets. If the flag hasn&amp;amp;#39;t been raised up to this point, it&amp;amp;#39;s certainly full mast now. The long-term assets are hard to immediately liquidate without penalties or market impact. Anyway, you see the picture.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With the cash reserve at Tether exhausted, I believe it marks the beginning of a potential bank run. In the recent 2018 crash, you can see that the confidence in Tether barely faltered (barely noticeable the amount being . In fact, the printing of Tether continues at a much more rapid pace moving forward. The market was still dependent on Tether.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/c7ost7ekzp591.png?width=1892&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=581de5fcaca690244273ec0426a8b702efc41792&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/c7ost7ekzp591.png?width=1892&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=581de5fcaca690244273ec0426a8b702efc41792&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But in May 2022, the severe liquidation of Tether began. That&amp;amp;#39;s the steep drop at the end of the blue line. With the crash of UST and the depegging of algorithmic stablecoins, I think the industry trust and sentiment towards stablecoins in general has faltered. And for good reason--taking a look at USDT, we can see that it has not recovered its peg to $1 since May 10 (see image below), which is right around the time that the major liquidations of USDT began.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/z16n8xhz1q591.png?width=1510&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=803bc5e6e4ae62405c313afe3992f08f92bd38b7&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/z16n8xhz1q591.png?width=1510&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=803bc5e6e4ae62405c313afe3992f08f92bd38b7&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The bear market in crypto, combined with all this news around big players like Luna/Terra, Celsius, and (potentially) 3AC collapsing, combined with all of the macro signals that indicate a recession (inflation, fed interest rate hikes, global war, food shortages, etc) are pushing people to get out of risky assets. As a result, we see the price of crypto dropping. And the circulation of USDT along with it. So people aren&amp;amp;#39;t just exiting cryptos into stablecoins; they&amp;amp;#39;re exiting USDT as well.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They are exiting USDT and either going into fiat or liquidating into other assets like USDC. You can see the chart for USDC market cap below, which started printing the same day that USDT collapsed, and has been growing in circulation ever since.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/vpe7uhap2q591.png?width=1518&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=c490b647446d1593ebe4d2870a51d94ca958e1bc&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/vpe7uhap2q591.png?width=1518&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=c490b647446d1593ebe4d2870a51d94ca958e1bc&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I think this is at least some indicator that people aren&amp;amp;#39;t just exiting crypto altogether, but also the trust and, ultimately, dependence, on USDT is waning. Following this current trajectory, I think there are a couple of scenarios that could result:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;USDT remains pegged to $1.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;USDT depegs from the dollar very quickly due to a bank run from lack of confidence in USDT. This would ultimately result in the collapse of USDT. This depeg would likely put significant stress on the market.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;USDT doesn&amp;amp;#39;t immediately depeg from the dollar, but dependence on USDT wanes, such that eventually once USDT does depeg, it doesn&amp;amp;#39;t affect the market very significantly.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And this is where my bias sets in. I don&amp;amp;#39;t wish harm or financial difficulty on anyone, and I mean no ill will to the Tether team. But I do hope that Tether also gets wiped during this crash. I think part of Tether&amp;amp;#39;s demise is already baked into the market, and evidence of this is demonstrated throughout this piece. On a more philosophical tone, Tether&amp;amp;#39;s demise is one that, I believe, is necessary for web3 to continue to grow in a healthy and sustainable manner. This market has been brutal to the unsustainable models, and I hope that Tether is no exception. It is a symbol of a broken system, and a collective delusion of the market that indicate that the market itself isn&amp;amp;#39;t ready to be taken seriously.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I predict that this will lead to a even higher sell-off because of the &amp;amp;quot;mental value&amp;amp;quot; of that price border. Same goes for ETH which is about to go below 1k.
I predict that once BTC falls below the 20k it will quickly drop down to at least 18k if not even lower and everything else will drop even harder.
I am looking for a good entry point but I guess we will have the whole year to &amp;amp;quot;buy the dip&amp;amp;quot; haha. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What do you guys think? How low will we crash before we see somewhat stable prices again?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Welcome to your monthly no-shill data dump: Here&amp;amp;#39;s the fourth monthly report for the 2022 Top Ten Experiment featuring &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BTC, ETH, BNB, SOL, ADA, USDC, XRP, LUNA, DOT, and AVAX.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;tl;dr&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;What&amp;amp;#39;s this all about?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven&amp;amp;#39;t sold or traded, reporting monthly for over four years. Did the same in 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;(including why in the world I would include stablecoins)&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;here&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Learn more about the new features in the 2022 Top Ten Experiment&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2022/&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;here&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;May Highlights:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; All coins in red, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;LUNA&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; implodes, loses nearly -100%.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;New features:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://np.reddit.com/r/cryptex/&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;TCAP&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; Total Crypto Market Cap token takes overall lead the Top Ten approach in our friendly competition&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Month Five – Down -66%&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/t8jmmdovyo591.png?width=949&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=bc765ddd7416b45e763ce2d71f03161bf9cc213b&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/t8jmmdovyo591.png?width=949&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=bc765ddd7416b45e763ce2d71f03161bf9cc213b&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The 2022 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Portfolio is &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BTC, ETH, BNB, Solana, ADA, USDC, XRP, LUNA, DOT, AVAX.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;May highlights for the 2022 Top Ten Portfolio:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Terra/Luna meltdown cuts 2022 Top Ten Portfolio value over half in one month.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;No winners this month and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;LUNA&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; falls -100%, unprecedented during the 4.5 year lifespan of of the Experiments&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;May Ranking and Dropouts&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here’s a look at the movement in the ranks five months into the 2022 Top Ten Index Fund Experiment:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/81ghgw7xyo591.png?width=409&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=f896b55c5ae6ace884d8bed0912669a34976e027&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/81ghgw7xyo591.png?width=409&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=f896b55c5ae6ace884d8bed0912669a34976e027&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;AVAX&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Luna&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; have dropped out of the Top Ten, replaced by &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BUSD&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;DOGE&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; (such wow).  &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Luna fell more than two hundred positions in the rankings in May.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For context, since January 2018 no other coin that has started the year in the Top Ten has fallen more than Luna.  Second place would be &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;NEM&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; from the 2018 Top Ten, ranked #88 as of the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-53&quot;&amp;gt;latest update&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;May Winners and Losers&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;May Winners&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; –  None. For the second month in a row, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BNB&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; (-22%) fell the least.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;May Losers&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; –  All of the Top Ten cryptos.  &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Luna&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; (-100%) had the worst performing month in the 4.5 year history of the Top Ten Experiments.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Overall Update: Terra/Luna implode, BTC best performer, BNB in second place&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In one month, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;LUNA&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; went from best performing crypto in the 2022 Top Ten Portfolio to -100%. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In terms of individual performance, this is completely without precedent: since starting the Top Ten Experiments in &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/&quot;&amp;gt;January 2018&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, no other crypto has imploded this quickly.  Yes, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;NEM&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Dash&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; from the 2018 Top Ten are down bad (both around -95%), but this has been a slow bleed over 4.5 years.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A Top Ten crypto like &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Luna&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; going to zero practically overnight is a first for the Experiments.  The initial $100 invested in &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Luna&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; just five months ago is worth $0 today.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Bitcoin&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, down -36% this year, is the best performing of the Top Ten.  &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BNB&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; (-41%) is second place, followed by &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;ETH&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; (-51%).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2022:&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/loos1y16zo591.png?width=333&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=2c37b6ddf610883a7a658804aff37d5caa15e3a0&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/loos1y16zo591.png?width=333&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=2c37b6ddf610883a7a658804aff37d5caa15e3a0&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After dropping $214 in April, the 2022 Top Ten Portfolio lost another $420 in May.  The initial $1000 investment on New Year’s Day 2022 is now worth &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$342&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, down two-thirds of its value just five months ago.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here’s a visual summary of the progress so far:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/uszxe608zo591.png?width=223&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=eeb5e6433acc3858168ceb617d7735119e8f1ae2&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/uszxe608zo591.png?width=223&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=eeb5e6433acc3858168ceb617d7735119e8f1ae2&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The 2022 Top Ten Cryptos are still the worst performing of the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/&quot;&amp;gt;five Portfolios&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Factoring in USDC Gains&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;New feature this year&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; – In past Experiment years, I have not included stablecoin gains in the monthly reports. These days, there are opportunities to earn ROI using stables alone. I figured this would be especially interesting this year, depending on how the crypto market performs. My goal of this little side quest will be to beat the ROI of as many of the non-stablecoin cryptos in the Experiment as possible.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I started the year using the most straightforward strategies, moving the $100 around to get bonuses (BlockFi then Nexo).  &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-4&quot;&amp;gt;Last month,&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; I decided to do something a bit more interesting.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My choice?  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Convert the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;USDC&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; to &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;UST&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, then deposit the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;UST&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; on Anchor.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Seemed like a good idea at the time.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Chasing that sweet, sweet, 18% yield.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;UST&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; is now worth $1.60.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here’s a table of the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;USDC&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; side mission so far this year. I’m down -99% in May, and -99% overall.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/s09t48c9zo591.png?width=793&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=68dbd3ca3d8cc3debce998a7e6c93f8cc605b96c&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/s09t48c9zo591.png?width=793&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=68dbd3ca3d8cc3debce998a7e6c93f8cc605b96c&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Oof.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;2022 Top Ten Portfolio vs. Total Crypto Market Cap Token (TCAP)&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Another new feature this year&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; – The first Top Ten Crypto Experiment was started on 1 January 2018 in an attempt to &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;capture the gains of the entire market&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. Much has changed in the last 4.5 years, including innovative Decentralized Finance (DeFi) projects that have created index tokens to capture segments of the crypto market (DeFi, the Metaverse, Blue Chips, etc.) instead of manually buying coins and tokens, like I do for my Experiments.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A project of particular interest to the Top Ten Experiments is the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Total Crypto Market Cap&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; (&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://cryptex.finance/&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;TCAP&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;) &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;token,&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; created by &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://np.reddit.com/r/cryptex/&quot;&amp;gt;Cryptex&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, which tracks the entire crypto market – exactly what my Top Ten Portfolios have been trying to recreate from the start.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I thought it would be interesting to compare my homemade 2022 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment to &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;TCAP&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; for a bit of a friendly competition. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here’s the question I’ll be tracking this year: &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;would I have been better off with $1,000 of TCAP instead of going through the effort of creating a homemade $1,000 Top Ten Index Fund?&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;May:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Both the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;TCAP&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; token and the 2022 Top Ten Portfolio fell significantly this month, but the damage to the Top Ten portfolio was more severe: the 2022 Top Ten dropped -55% in May and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;TCAP&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; fell -36%&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;TCAP&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; snapshot June 1st: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/7950qdbbzo591.png?width=511&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=49732f5eb282a8bdaf030f7f400b417b61236eac&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/7950qdbbzo591.png?width=511&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=49732f5eb282a8bdaf030f7f400b417b61236eac&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The May monthly victory goes to the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;TCAP&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Overall:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; The 2022 Top Ten Portfolio is currently worth $342 (-66% from January 1st, 2022) which places it below &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;TCAP’s&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; $460 (-54% from January 1st, 2022) value.  &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;TCAP&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; takes the overall lead as well.  Visual below:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/0i9rpwlczo591.png?width=844&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=71dc2fe0fc8cd3532a00f16f0f7ed5a58dd31b52&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/0i9rpwlczo591.png?width=844&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=71dc2fe0fc8cd3532a00f16f0f7ed5a58dd31b52&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Bitcoin Dominance:&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;BitDom continued to increase this month, ending May at 46.1%. For context, there hasn’t been much movement on this metric so far in 2022. Chart below:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/0gb67imdzo591.png?width=582&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=ff05ec2a56cb835c716b9be546aae28cb7279c6c&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/0gb67imdzo591.png?width=582&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=ff05ec2a56cb835c716b9be546aae28cb7279c6c&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For those just getting into crypto, it’s worth paying attention to the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Bitcoin&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; dominance figure, as it signals the appetite for altcoins vs. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BTC.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So, where do we stand if we combine five years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-53&quot;&amp;gt;2018 Top Ten Experiment:&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; down -32% (total value $683)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;2019 Top Ten Experiment: up +238% (total value $3,376)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;2020 Top Ten Experiment: up +381% (total value $4,808) &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;(best performing portfolio)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;2021 Top Ten Experiment: up +99% (total value $$1,991)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-5&quot;&amp;gt;2022 Top Ten Experiment:&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; down -66% (total value $342)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Taking the five portfolios together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom bottom &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;bottom&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; line: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;After five annual $1k investments ($5,000 total) in the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; the combined portfolios are worth &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$11,200.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;That’s up +124%&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; on the combined portfolios.  The peak  for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;November 2021’s all time high&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; of &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;+533%&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.  Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020 for those who do better with visuals:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/k4erhi1fzo591.png?width=600&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=35bd94e0daac509d823e78d91cbf5704f699c1c2&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/k4erhi1fzo591.png?width=600&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=35bd94e0daac509d823e78d91cbf5704f699c1c2&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In summary: &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;That’s a +124% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for five straight years&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Comparison to S&amp;amp;amp;P 500&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I’m also tracking the S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 as part of my Experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/la11hypgzo591.png?width=538&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=c651426b4c19e1e5d890049cc89c2a7013187719&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/la11hypgzo591.png?width=538&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=c651426b4c19e1e5d890049cc89c2a7013187719&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 is down -14% so far in 2022, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on New Year’s Day would be worth $860 had it been redirected to the S&amp;amp;amp;P.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;$1000 investment in S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1,530 today&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;$1000 investment in S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1,640 today&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;$1000 investment in S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,270 today&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;$1000 investment in S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,090 today&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;$1000 investment in S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $860 today&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Taken together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom bottom &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;bottom&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; line for a similar approach with the S&amp;amp;amp;P: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;After five $1,000 investments into an S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 my portfolio would be worth $6,390.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That is up &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;+28%&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/&quot;&amp;gt;since January 2018&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; compared to a &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;+124%&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The visual below shows a comparison on ROI between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&amp;amp;amp;P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/k2hexloizo591.png?width=575&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=3e35005821435df2905e118967c7c256ca852507&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/k2hexloizo591.png?width=575&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=3e35005821435df2905e118967c7c256ca852507&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Conclusion:&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you so much for sticking around so long. For those just getting into crypto, I hope these reports will help prepare you for the highs and lows that await on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, go with the flow, think long term, and truly don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose, and most importantly, try to enjoy the ride. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A reporting note: I’ll focus on 2022 Top Ten Portfolio reports + one other portfolio on a rotating basis this year, so expect only two reports from me per month.  May’s extended report is on the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio, which you can access &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-53&quot;&amp;gt;here&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.  You can check out the latest &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-38&quot;&amp;gt;2019 Top Ten&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-27&quot;&amp;gt;2020 Top Ten&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, and &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-16&quot;&amp;gt;2021 Top Ten&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; reports as well.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

That is highly unlikely. Here is why...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It takes on average 18-24 months for the inflationary results of monetary / economic policy to play out in the and appear in the real economy. The same is true for the reverse. Raising interest rates and balance sheet roll off will take time, a lot of time... and we&amp;amp;#39;ve only just gotten started!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If history is any guide, inflation is here to stay for the next several years. The Fed is so far behind the curve that it will take years to tame inflation... just like in the late 70&amp;amp;#39;s / early 80&amp;amp;#39;s. Back then, Paul Volker raised interest rates to obscene levels in the 15-19% range. Even then, it took years for inflation to cool down. Of course, it caused a massive recession and unemployment too, i.e. stagflation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also, the Fed won&amp;amp;#39;t be able to raise interest rates anywhere near what Volker did. The cost to service the national debt would be too high. We&amp;amp;#39;re already paying $420 billion dollars a year to service the debt, that&amp;amp;#39;s almost 9% of the entire federal budget. Do you really think we could afford it to consume 20-25% of the federal budget? No way.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If the Fed raises rates above 3%, it will actually be losing money as it will be paying more on interest to the banks on excess reserves than it brings in through its balance sheet. That is a big no no.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There is really only one way to fight inflation in a post-QE environment, and it&amp;amp;#39;s not raising interest rates, it&amp;amp;#39;s by accelerating the balance sheet roll off.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;By accelerating the balance sheet roll off, the Fed will literally remove money from circulation. However, currently they&amp;amp;#39;re only letting $45B per month roll off, and $90B per month by the end of summer. That isn&amp;amp;#39;t anywhere near enough, it needs to be at least $300-400 billion per month because the Fed has a $9 Trillion balance sheet.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Instead the Fed is going to let inflation run hot for the next couple years or longer so get used to it.  Inflation is currently sitting at 8.6% YOY. It will probably reach 10% by the end of summer, and higher by the end of 2022. Now imagine it stays at 10% throughout next year... that&amp;amp;#39;s 20% over 2 years. That&amp;amp;#39;s when the real pain starts.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Let&amp;amp;#39;s be nice to eachother. Some of us are going thru a pretty hard time right now. What benefit does it bring you to attack an innocent (probably a noob) crypto enthusiast? You really need the minor ego boost THAT badly? Were not eachothers enemies.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The same ones calling banks and hedge funds evil are probably a lot of the same ones laughing as they kick the fallen while they&amp;amp;#39;re down.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And don&amp;amp;#39;t trust information without double checking. Even my information. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The OP of the post below forgot to do that.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/vc1z3j/why_are_so_many_of_you_people_hodling_nomatter/&quot;&amp;gt;https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/vc1z3j/why_are_so_many_of_you_people_hodling_nomatter/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Giving some inaccurate information, and some bad advice on timing the market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Nobody knows what&amp;amp;#39;s going to happen, so don&amp;amp;#39;t try to time the market, unless you&amp;amp;#39;re ready to gamble.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s a much more complex picture than OP was trying to paint.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So don&amp;amp;#39;t pull out everything, or go all in on shorts. Pull out only what you&amp;amp;#39;re not comfortable having out there.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But don&amp;amp;#39;t try to bet on the direction of the market. Instead strategize for multiple potential scenarios.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;1- OP is inaccurately describing how the Fed reduces its balance sheet.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;The Fed is going to sell another $45 billion in assets in July, and another $45B in August. Then, they will increase the rate to $95 BILLION EVERY MONTH starting in September.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That&amp;amp;#39;s simply not true. The Fed isn&amp;amp;#39;t doing a selloff, it&amp;amp;#39;s doing a runoff. It&amp;amp;#39;s simply gonna let part of its balance sheet runoff and let bonds reach maturity.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They are doing that by simply not re-investing some of the bonds that come to maturity.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Evidence: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20220504b.htm&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20220504b.htm&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stlouisfed.org/open-vault/2022/may/how-will-fed-reduce-balance-sheet&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.stlouisfed.org/open-vault/2022/may/how-will-fed-reduce-balance-sheet&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;2- &amp;amp;quot;The fed meeting is tomorrow and its going to be a .75 basis point hike&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;OP didn&amp;amp;#39;t provide any evidence on how he already knows this. The Fed haven&amp;amp;#39;t announced anything yet.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Just because everyone expects it to be .75, doesn&amp;amp;#39;t mean it will be.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In fact, since everyone seems to expect a .75, that would increase the likelihood that the selloff for the last few days, might be already pricing this in.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;3- Last time we starting having QT was in October 2017.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is back when Janet Yellen started to reduce the balance sheet by $650 Billion.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Remember what happened to Crypto in October 2017, and the following couple months?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m definitely not saying the same will happen. Conditions were different. And QT went on for several months, where Bitcoin started to dive again. I&amp;amp;#39;m just saying QT alone isn&amp;amp;#39;t an automatic guarantee of anything for crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Things have to be put into context.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But more importantly, policies on QT have changed since then.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;2017 didn&amp;amp;#39;t have the result expected, and they eventually had to pull to plug on their QT.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This time around there&amp;amp;#39;s a couple of policies to safeguard from that happening, with some safety switches. Banks will be able to have liquidity when needed, and the New York Fed can setup unscheduled domestic repurchase agreements.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;4- OP claims that there is &amp;amp;quot;An almost perfect correlation between crypto and the Nasdaq&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That&amp;amp;#39;s not entirely accurate.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While there has been a recent increase in correlation, it has never been a 1:1, nor near perfect, nor above 0.9 in statistical correlation to stocks.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/r39d2rme3n591.jpg?width=1198&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=2e15f051e0149f1058c1894b613da5162c73f58e&quot;&amp;gt;In 2022 Nasdaq 100 correlation peaked at 0.7&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/o1h7oqyh3n591.jpg?width=1830&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=f5c002b076a4187494959afe807f65a686032d56&quot;&amp;gt;0.75 correlation peak with the S&amp;amp;amp;P 500&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;0.8 and above is generally considered &amp;amp;quot;strong correlation&amp;amp;quot;. But we&amp;amp;#39;ve only reached around 0.7 with stocks. At 0.5 you have a moderate correlation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A short term spike from around 0.5 to 0.7 isn&amp;amp;#39;t exactly an &amp;amp;quot;almost perfect correlation&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That&amp;amp;#39;s a little bit of an exaggeration.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;5-&amp;amp;quot;And when both the stock market and the housing market get tumultuous, risk assest get sold first. That is what you are starting to see.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We are starting to see a tumultuous housing market?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s a red hot housing market right now. It might crash. Maybe next month. Maybe next decade. But we don&amp;amp;#39;t know that.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also, Bitcoin has been selling off since November of last year. When the stock market was still reaching new highs month after month. We already entered a bear market before stocks started to tank.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We&amp;amp;#39;ve seen mixed information about this.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Earlier this year, on the day stocks dropped into correction, Bitcoin went up.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/3h13rb7d4n591.jpg?width=1335&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=ce3d1fc4552473ed2512b7eb72173d9aaed73488&quot;&amp;gt;Bitcoin vs S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 on the day stocks officially entered \&amp;amp;quot;correction\&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then it went on to go in a mini bull run from $35K to $47K when the war broke out in Ukraine, while stocks were tanking.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/fvgi7g4k4n591.jpg?width=1330&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=494db109a610bcbbe44abbbde21a5d0ce48e796b&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/fvgi7g4k4n591.jpg?width=1330&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=494db109a610bcbbe44abbbde21a5d0ce48e796b&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When Chinese markets tanked between the end of 2015 and the beginning of 2016, and the stock market in the US went into a little panic and dipped into correction, Bitcoin went from around $200 to around $400.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On the other side of that, Bitcoin crashed with the rest of the world during the covid crash.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So the correlation isn&amp;amp;#39;t always consistent or guaranteed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s not a sure fire thing you can rely on.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;6- At the end of the day, the picture is more complicated than that. Never trust anyone who tells you things will definitely go worse, or definitely go better.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;No one really knows.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Keep in mind, markets are based on emotions more than fundamentals. So they can always do something irrational.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But the fundamentals aren&amp;amp;#39;t even that crystal clear.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We are in a bear market, and stocks are heading into recession.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But at the same time, we have conflicting data.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We had negative GDP in the US, in big part because of the big jump in trade deficit. Which came from the after effects of covid restrictions, and supply chain clogs.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But now the bottlenecks in the main US ports have dropped by nearly 40%. So it&amp;amp;#39;s not guaranteed that GDP will be negative again next quarter.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also, unemployment is at a historic low. And at the same time, 2022 had some of the highest wage increases in over 10 years.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Consumer spending has been up 2.7% despite inflation. And even inflation adjusted, it&amp;amp;#39;s still up 0.7%.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;OPEC has started to increase its output, and is set to increase its output in July by another 400K barrels a day. Possibly more if they reach an agreement with the G7.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That could help quell both inflation and supply chain problems.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So the outlook is a little more complex.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If it was a sure thing, we&amp;amp;#39;d all be millionaires.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I considered dumping everything into crypto. Taking out leverage. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But I didn&amp;amp;#39;t because this sub would have posts from vets saying - dont do that. Warning that crypto winters are coooold and hard. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So I DCAed in. I avoided alt coins. I didnt spend more than I can afford to lose. I diversified into energy stocks. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now its the end of the world - and I feel fine! No leverage so my crypto can sit there. I have cash so I dont need to panic sell. Im actually getting ready to buy when we truly hit the bottom! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So thanks to all the gloomy bastards who spent the last two years warning to be careful - I was ready for this shit show because of you.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Why not spend a little more time paying attention to the economy in the short-term, so you can make proactive decisions about your investments? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here&amp;amp;#39;s a bit of reality for all you genius apes.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The fed meeting is tomorrow and its going to be a .75 basis point hike.  First time since 1994.  Some of this is already baked into markets (I&amp;amp;#39;m assuming you&amp;amp;#39;ve realized by now that your stocks are down almost 10% and crypto is down 30% since Friday), but there is always more room to drop and more pain to come. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A lot more.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When JP pulls a switcheroo from .5 to .75 a mere 36 hours before the Fed meeting, you had better bed your ass that he&amp;amp;#39;ll open up the doors for more hikes at .75.  And he should.  A CPI at 8.6 is bonkers with a base funds rate of 1.5%.  It&amp;amp;#39;s borderline economic catastrophe.  Since the invention of the dollar, rate hikes have only successfully brought down inflation once they got within 2.5% of the inflation rate.  Get your calculator out bc that means if the inflation rate were to stay at 8.7 (yea right) it would take 6 more rate hikes to get us in the functional range. When he says that &amp;amp;quot;we are now considering .75 rate hikes in July and September, possibly higher&amp;amp;quot; you had better believe people are going to trade whatever they can for cold hard cash.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And that&amp;amp;#39;s not all.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You&amp;amp;#39;ve probably heard of Quantitative &amp;amp;quot;Easing&amp;amp;quot;.  That&amp;amp;#39;s how the Fed &amp;amp;quot;prints&amp;amp;quot; money into existence. They create the money on a magic computer and use it to purchase treasuries and mortgage-backed securities (those bundles of mortgages you heard Christian Bale and Steve Carrell talking so much about in The Big Short).  The Fed bought 3 boatloads of this stuff in 2008 (these purchases are referred to as the &amp;amp;quot;bailouts&amp;amp;quot;), and up to now they&amp;amp;#39;ve got about $8,500,000,000,000 worth.  That&amp;amp;#39;s trillion, with a T. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now we get to play a new game.  Quantitative &amp;amp;quot;Tightening&amp;amp;quot;.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Starting tomorrow (Wednesday for anyone late to the party), the Fed will sell $45,000,000,000 in assets onto the open market.  That&amp;amp;#39;s going to be a whole lot of pressure on markets to stay up and we all know people aren&amp;amp;#39;t exactly buying-hand-over-fist right now.  Their purpose is to bring markets down.  That, by definition, is fighting inflation.  Remember: price up = bad.  Price down = good.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But the QT fun doesn&amp;amp;#39;t end there.  The Fed is going to sell another $45 billion in assets in July, and another $45B in August.  Then, they will increase the rate to $95 BILLION EVERY MONTH starting in September.  At that rate of monthly selling they won&amp;amp;#39;t run out of MBS for 7.5  years.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Let&amp;amp;#39;s talk about those mortgage-backed securities for a second. Those bundles of thousands of mortgages we call MBS start out when you buy a house. Or when your cousin buys a condo to rent on Airbnb.  Remember when you finally closed on your house and 2 days later you received a letter saying that your loan was purchased by another lender?  &amp;amp;quot;Underwriting&amp;amp;quot; is your lender making sure there is a buyer ready and willing to buy this loan the moment you close on the property.  That&amp;amp;#39;s why you get the notice right away.  As you were figuring out to whom you should make your mortgage payment that new lender was bundling your loan with many others to sell yet again to a bigger bank.  The bundle grows each time and at some point they refer to them as MBS, and for some reason they are considered much more secure than individual mortgages.  They are given ratings like A, BB, CCC, etc.  Picture Ryan Gosling playing jenga.  Now when the biggest MBS customer not only stops buying but starts dumping MBS onto the market, you can imagine the demand for these bundles of joy will shift.  Soon smaller banks can&amp;amp;#39;t sell to bigger banks as easily as before. And eventually not at all.  This past Friday the market for MBS actually hit &amp;amp;quot;zero bids&amp;amp;quot; for the first time since 2008 (you might have seen a tweet from the actual Michael Burry).  As loans become harder to sell, will also become harder to write.  And we know what that will do to the housing market.  Remember: price down = good.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now you&amp;amp;#39;re getting it.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Lastly, because my legs are asleep, you need to understand that most of the money that came into crypto since 2017 was not from people here on reddit.  Many of them do not share your diamond hands conviction, and their crypto investment doesn&amp;amp;#39;t represent an &amp;amp;quot;inflation hedge&amp;amp;quot;.  It represents the riskiest thing they&amp;amp;#39;ve ever done with their money.  Ever. Big risk = big reward.  And when both the stock market and the housing market get tumultuous, risk assest get sold first.  That is what you are starting to see. An almost perfect correlation between crypto and the Nasdaq, just where the swings in crypto gains and losses are exaggerated. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Unfortunately we are probably one or two cycles away from certain cryptos being seen and used like the scarce resource inflation hedge that they really are.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So here you are, with all this new knowledge and a bag of Shitcoin Potpourri.  And there is a train coming tomorrow that will last until at least through September.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Good luck!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

It’s going to look like a cold winter’s night, the trees will look dead, snow will cover the entire expanse and there will be a fear that it will be impossible for Bitcoin to ever reach the highs it once had. Until then, buckle up, this failed “inflation hedge” idea isn’t hedging anybody from shit. I’m looking at next year and 2024 as the new bloom. Now we are in the entertainment phase, watching shitcoins and scammy exchanges get rekt, because all they were selling were hopes and dreams.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The relative strength index (RSI) is a momentum indicator used in technical analysis that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions in the price of a stock or other asset. An asset is usually considered overbought when the RSI is above 70% and oversold when it is below 30%.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The RSI will rise as the number and size of positive closes increase, and it will fall as the number and size of losses increase. The second part of the calculation smooths the result, so the RSI will only near 100 or 0 in a strongly trending market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Going on the Weekly charts only, as this is a very long term outlook. Not even the Daily provides this broad of a perspective.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/7fibhwd15i591.png?width=1443&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=ce1699b5f5d0fe1d4545cf78942f03b722ba05d0&quot;&amp;gt;BTC Weekly&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In 2011, just two years after the birth of Bitcoin, the weekly RSI was at 21. The price of bitcoin was $2.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In January 2015, it hit 27. Price was $154.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In December 2019, it hit 29. Price was $3150.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These levels are all textbook oversold values. In the past, every single time it hit these condition levels, it went back to 50 points over the next ~6 months, and hovered around that price for most of that time. After that, it has never again returned to those prices.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Right now, it is at 26, and this is the most oversold it has been in 11 years. I am buying for the next six months. Merry Christmas.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I don&amp;amp;#39;t know how that&amp;amp;#39;s handled, but it&amp;amp;#39;s getting close to the level where they are supposed to post more collateral...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In other news...Michael Saylor posted this on twitter, “MicroStrategy has a $205M term loan and needs to maintain $410M as collateral. MSTR has 115,109 BTC that it can pledge. If the price of BTC falls below $3,562 the company could post some other collateral”.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
