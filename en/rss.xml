&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Many have that misconception here that staking is that cool &amp;amp;quot;passive income&amp;amp;quot; that makes you money while you sleep. But you really won&amp;amp;#39;t make much money at all. It&amp;amp;#39;s actually an amount you can just ignore. Personally I staked and committed ALGO to governance (the possibly simplest staking coin), still I did not got any amount that may be worth the time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Obviously it&amp;amp;#39;s always nice to get some bonus and as it&amp;amp;#39;s free money you should definitely take it. But don&amp;amp;#39;t think that you will become rich due to it. Staking is just a way to expand your fortune, not change it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Since March 11, Ether has climbed by roughly 24%, while Bitcoin has increased by about 16%.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The enthusiasm around a planned software upgrade that promises to minimize the blockchain&amp;amp;#39;s carbon footprint while also improving the network&amp;amp;#39;s scalability and efficiency is driving the Ether gains. The next significant, ambitious milestone for the Ethereum network is expected to attract millions of additional users.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As far as I can tell, the merge, which is Ethereum&amp;amp;#39;s transition from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake blockchain, has been greatly anticipated and may be the network&amp;amp;#39;s most significant development since its founding in 2015.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I believe the price of ETH will skyrocket since all transactions formerly carried out with USDT BEAN and other stablecoins, as well as other cryptocurrencies, can and will be carried out on the ETH network. Definitely the next big thing in the crypto realm, and I&amp;amp;#39;m looking forward to seeing it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

While it does seem like its more oriented towards stablecoin regulation, there are some interesting takeaways for defi too.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;First, they aim to bring stablecoins under regulation, so it can be used as a form of payment! This is massive for the entire crypto space! Imagine if you can spend USDC and possibly GBP stables straight from your wallet on e-commerce websites, travels, and even instore shopping? It could be a game changer for crypto adoption. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Stablecoins to be brought within regulation paving their way for use in the UK as a recognised form of payment.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On DeFi: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The UK government will explore ways of enhancing the competitiveness of the UK tax system to encourage further development of the cryptoasset market in the UK. It will review how DeFi loans – where holders of cryptoassets lend them out for a return – are treated for tax purposes&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Treating defi loans has been tricky, with some countries like Sweden even considering defi loans as a capital gains tax event. (For example, if you borrow stables from crypto, it is treated as if you sold the crypto. This is by far the worst treatment). Friendly regulations here could grow the crypto market in the country, as users can take loans from defi protocols without it being considered as a tax event. This in turn could spur the economy, as the money borrowed from defi can be used in regular economic activity. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak said: It’s my ambition to make the UK a global hub for cryptoasset technology, and the measures we’ve outlined today will help to ensure firms can invest, innovate and scale up in this country.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Overall, the move seem positive and the full proposal is much awaited! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Something that moves 20% [overnight] does not feel like a currency. It is a vehicle to perpetrate fraud&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To this&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/31/bitcoin-goldman-is-close-to-offering-bitcoin-to-its-richest-clients.html&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/31/bitcoin-goldman-is-close-to-offering-bitcoin-to-its-richest-clients.html&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;We are working closely with teams across the firm to explore ways to offer thoughtful and appropriate access to the ecosystem for private wealth clients&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;There are also a large contingent of clients who feel like we’re sitting at the dawn of a new Internet in some ways and are looking for ways to participate in this space&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;We’re still in the very nascent stages of this ecosystem; But I think it’s fairly safe to expect it will be part of our future.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So from a vehicle for fraudsters to the dawn of a new internet that their wealthiest clients cant wait to invest in. And these are the people we are supposed to trust to invest our money huh?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What a mug I am. Had been building up my BTC for seven years and lost it in a few minutes&amp;amp;#39; utter stupidity. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Amazing to hear Trezor was using MailChimp.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;More amazed that I fell for it: I thought I was savvy. Clearly not. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sad times, frens. I have become a Normie McNocoiner. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;:-(&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: yes I entered my keys, because I&amp;amp;#39;m a twat&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit 2: a lot of people saying they&amp;amp;#39;d never fall for it. I hope they&amp;amp;#39;re right. At the time I had not slept enough, was a bit hungover and was distracted. These are the times when you&amp;amp;#39;re vulnerable to doing stupid shit. Clearly I am the mong, but never rest on your laurels.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It can happen to anyone. You&amp;amp;#39;re tired, arguing with your gf, distracted, etc... nobody is perfect. He lost everything. I can&amp;amp;#39;t afford that. Shit gives me nightmares.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;ve been intending to buy a Trezor for some time now, but I keep hesitating. I&amp;amp;#39;ve been so nervous about the whole thing. What if I lose my seed phrase? I live n NYC, someone breaks into my apartment, a fire, collapse, etc.. call me paranoid.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now that Coinbase One offers insurance, I&amp;amp;#39;m not even going to worry about cold storage. I sleep better this way. I don&amp;amp;#39;t care about all the &amp;amp;quot;not your keys not your coins&amp;amp;quot; arguments. I have a legally enforceable contract with Coinbase now that I pay for.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;True, it&amp;amp;#39;s price is kinda steep at $30 a month, but to me it&amp;amp;#39;s worth it. It comes with no trading fees which sweetens the pie. Also comes with &amp;amp;quot;priority&amp;amp;quot; customer support, which I tested and only had to wait 2 minutes before I was speaking to a live agent.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So yeah, fuck that. I&amp;amp;#39;m just too paranoid. If US gov ever looks like it&amp;amp;#39;s on the verge of collapse, then yeah, I might put it in cold storage before I bounce out of the country. Until them I rest easy with my coins insured on an exchange.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Stablecoins are a huge part of the defi infrastructure, and whoever controls stablecoin market stands to gain the most adoption in the space. This is why commercial banks and even central banks are interested in the crypto space so much - there is a ton of money to be made. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;UST has been making headlines in recent months, both positive and negative. It&amp;amp;#39;s market cap has grown to several billions in a short time, and recently has been buying up billions worth BTC to backstop their stablecoin. However it has not gone without criticism and concern, many have pointed out how it is less of an algorithmic stablecoin now and more of an asset backed stablecoin. In reply, Terranauts have maintained that the ends justify the means - the stated goal of Terra is to be the most widely adopted stablecoin. Whether it is purely algorithimic or asset backed is dependent on how the market evolves. If the market feels it is risky for $20 bn worth stablecoins to be just backed by algorithm, then Terra team will ensure the demands of the market are met. With UST, many users were uncomfortable that it is unbacked by assets, and hence they came up with a proposal to buy bitcoins. A comparison can be made with a space flight programme - the goal is to reach space. Whether it uses an internal combustion engine or pivots a few years later to electric ion thrusters doesnt change the goal. Similarly, the only goal of Terra is to be the largest stablecoin in terms of adoption. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Earlier this year, the founder of Maker DAO (DAI stablecoin) called UST a &amp;amp;quot;solid ponzi&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/6neert82s8r81.jpg?width=2274&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=b4017b735a9c143ebcee4363da91276a05b8197c&quot;&amp;gt;Rune: \&amp;amp;quot;UST and MIM are solid ponzis\&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In return, UST teamed up with another stablecoin Frax to announce a Curve 4-pool as a competitor to replace 3-pool.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/t8pvbscds8r81.jpg?width=1346&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=ce4a70d6eab1e854350420ea3c4efe06a105c524&quot;&amp;gt;Curve 4-pool launched with UST and Frax&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;What is a curve pool?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Curve is the DEX with the highest TVL for stablecoins, and curve pools provide deep liquidity for stablecoin swaps. For example if you are swapping 1m USDC to DAI, you will find a better rate on Curve compared to other swaps like Uniswap. Curve wars have been going on for a while now, with several protocols looking to capture Curve emissions. Together with Convex (CVX), DAOs are able to gain userbase by directing incentives to pool participants. If Curve is the king of Defi, Convex can be regarded as the King maker. CRV+CVX combo can direct large portions of defi markets and are primitive protocols behind the defi infrastructure. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Curve 3-pool has been the standard stablecoin liquidity pool across defi till now. Many protocols utilise the 3-pool for their liquidity requirements. Now, UST and Frax are looking to disrupt this. Terra with Frax along with additional partners like Redacted Cartel control a huge portion of the CVX supply. With this, they are able to direct emissions towards the 4-pool, thus they will able to sustain a higer APY for 4-pool over 3-pool and move liquidity from 3-pool towards the new 4-pool. For instance, if the 3-pool has 1.5% APY and 4-pool is able to sustain 5% APY due to their control over CVX, a lot of liquidity from 3pool will migrate to 4pool. Currently, 3pool has around $3.5 BN worth liquidity that is going to be incentivized to move to 4-pool.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;What does it mean for DAI?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To put it shortly, a war has been declared on DAI. 4-pool excludes DAI, so if a lot of liquidity from 3-pool moves towards 4-pool, the liquidity of DAI will drop drastically. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/6m7rw60nv8r81.jpg?width=1308&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=d582977937d7916486992c84260425971adec58a&quot;&amp;gt;DAI liquidity could drop dramatically. &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Currently, there is no incentive to provide any liquidity to the 3-pool. With incentives on 4pool, we could see a lot of the TVL migrate. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/r8z7egpgu8r81.jpg?width=1316&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=ff4f22b66b540c2b9e8a420e7b3ac49c3572dcb6&quot;&amp;gt;Do Kwon: The goal is to starve 3pool. &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While Maker DAI has been publicly attacking UST and Terra, Terra have been working behind the scenes to make their move and have partnered with influential protocols like Frax and Redacted Cartel. And it is a bold one. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Dethroning 3-pool isnt as easy as most of defi liquidity is based on 3pool currently. However USD+Frax DAOs control a big chunk of CRV and CVX so they will definitely give it their best shot. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/z14aj4hju8r81.jpg?width=1320&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=4e173236f93c40cca408453f8c538560e1ff34bf&quot;&amp;gt;DAI liquidity on most DEX is just a few millions. &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Everyone is now interested to see what will DAI&amp;amp;#39;s next move will be!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

So in case you were there in 2015 and held all this time you would be rich, but most of us didn&amp;amp;#39;t invest back then and most of us would probably sell a lot of it by now.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;So with this mentality, they would say the key is in HODLING.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Simply choose quality projects, invest money in them and wait a few years for wealth.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So lets take a look at&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/20171217/&quot;&amp;gt;2017.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you invested  in top15 coins in 2017 and compare some of those coins to today’s price you would be at loss. And those are good projects.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Coins like:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BCH that was $1,862.88 and now is $375.23&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;LTC that was $318.72 and now is $126.40&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;IOTA that was $3.93 and now is $0.8997&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;DASH that was $1,105.92 and now is $130.23&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Huge loss.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So with this example we can see that not taking profits is a &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;mistake?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In essence, it could be said that it all depends on the time you invested, but just HODLING without taking profits can be fatal. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Of course, with blue chips like BTC and ETH there are no mistakes and people who were patient now don&amp;amp;#39;t have to worry about money for the rest of their lives.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This being said, I am holding some coins for a long term. I am not against holding, I am just saying that holding mentality is not everything and that taking profits is a right thing to do.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;hr/&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;hr/&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rroftv/safemoon_giving_old_holders_mere_hours_warning/&quot;&amp;gt;A catch up if necessary&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;hr/&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;hr/&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On December 29th at 16:00 UTC, Safemoon implemented a 100% tax to discourage arbitrage trading, and announced this just 1.5 hours previously and only on limited social media channels.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;If you bought, sold or transferred Safemoon after this date&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, your tokens were taken from you and sent to the Liquidity Pool, where they have since been &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://bscscan.com/token/0x9adc6fb78cefa07e13e9294f150c1e8c1dd566c0?a=0xcd198be08a33cbe2172f3be45cdb431e060076bc#tokenAnalytics&quot;&amp;gt;withdrawn several times&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; (Look at the big spike that started on December 29th, these vipers knew what they were doing and withdrew straight away).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The legality of this is still under review, and after ignoring it for months and months, the folks over at &amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://np.reddit.com/r/SafemoonCase&quot;&amp;gt;SafeMoonCase&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; jumped on the back of an existing lawsuit for Safemoon (alleging a pump &amp;amp;amp; dump scheme) and submitted a new class-action lawsuit, demanding Safemoon return the stolen tokens, and giving them the standard 14 days to respond. Safemoon did respond on the 13th day, but only with a generic &amp;amp;quot;We&amp;amp;#39;re looking in to this&amp;amp;quot;, with no indication of urgency, timescales or how it will happen.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;hr/&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;hr/&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thankfully, the blockchain is public and with a little sleuthing I have discovered an easy and verifiable way to tally up all of the stolen funds. And yes, I&amp;amp;#39;m using &amp;amp;quot;stolen&amp;amp;quot; here because I believe that the act of ruthlessly taxing transactions at 100% constitutes theft.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;First, you find a site that will let you query the Binance Smart Chain. I found one that lets me query using SQL, which is a language I have some experience in. And now I&amp;amp;#39;m going to show you how to do it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If we look at a simple &amp;amp;quot;taxed&amp;amp;quot; transaction hash, we get this:  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;hr/&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://bscscan.com/tx/0x3a67b4b12ae60ac6cbc6c18e58ff69499059ba5da111e7009560e6f5239f8758&quot;&amp;gt;This transaction for 990 million Safemoon, worth approx $1,000 at time of transfer, was taxed 100%&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can see the &amp;amp;quot;output&amp;amp;quot; of this wallet-to-wallet transaction was 0.0000001 Safemoon. To find the input is a little trickier, you need to look at the raw transaction data, which is this:  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;Function: transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount)

MethodID: 0xa9059cbb
[0]:  000000000000000000000000c8ff694f4aed464e78123701b0c6cd6ef4b3b54c
[1]:  0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000dbe14ef8f2d8773  
&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;See that second part of the bracket? The value is stored as a uint256 figure (Hex), so you need to convert it to Decimal, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://codebeautify.org/hex-decimal-converter&quot;&amp;gt;which is the second line (ending 8773)&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. You must input &amp;amp;quot;dbe14ef8f2d8773&amp;amp;quot;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This returns &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;990251987199952800&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, which is missing the decimal place. Divide it by 1000000000 (1 with 9 zeroes) and that finally returns 990251987.199952  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And there you have it. The input of the transaction, or the Safemoon that was attempted to be sent, was 990,251,987, approximately $1,094, and the Safemoon Developers stole this by enacting an unethical 100% tax. You can get the transaction value &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/safemoon/historical-data/&quot;&amp;gt;by looking at historical Safemoon V1 prices on CoinMarketCap&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;hr/&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;hr/&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So now we want to get &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;EVERY&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; transaction that was stolen. That&amp;amp;#39;s easy enough. You create a query that looks to get &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;ALL&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; transactions on the S&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://bscscan.com/token/0x8076c74c5e3f5852037f31ff0093eeb8c8add8d3&quot;&amp;gt;afemoon V1 contract&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;AFTER&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; 2021-12-29 16:00, where the MethodID of the transaction is &amp;amp;quot;transfer&amp;amp;quot; (this is people attempting to move Safemoon from one wallet to another), and where the transaction was successful (I.e, it didn&amp;amp;#39;t fail due to low BNB for gas)  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This gives us a whopping 44,718 lines. But 9,233 of these transactions were whitelisted and actually &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;not subject to the 100% tax!&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; (It&amp;amp;#39;s still unclear why so many wallets appear to be whitelisted)  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;However, the other 35,485 transactions since the 29th December 2021 were taxed at a 100% rate, and here&amp;amp;#39;s what Safemoon collected:&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;3.93 TRILLION Safemoon V1 tokens&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Worth approximately $6,309,371 at time of transfer&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;hr/&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;hr/&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;ve got some more stats you may find interesting:  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The largest amount of tokens taxed in one go was on the 7th March 2022 where &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;over 210 BILLION tokens were taxed&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, at an approximate value of $105,737. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://bscscan.com/tx/0xd5822cfe0713a815ba2251e4a018321da9f9b81a3d3cd675f32d40ac5f5d9c03&quot;&amp;gt;Here is the transaction.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The largest value of tokens taxed in one go was $171,337, where 85 BILLION tokens were taxed on the 31st December 2021, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://bscscan.com/tx/0xf22e2e4ddddef9059b41ed51507178f7062c529c410600769f539e0277dbfbd2&quot;&amp;gt;Happy New Years to that poor bastard&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;In just these two transactions, Safemoon developers stole over $277,000.&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The most tax taken in one day was from 3,090 different wallets, on the 31st December, worth 625 Billion Safemoon, valued at $1,259,035 - not bad for a day&amp;amp;#39;s work.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;hr/&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;hr/&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyone want a reminder of the opinion of the Safemoon community to those who lost all their money via tax?&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/s28y63/according_to_the_safemoon_army_if_you_do_not/&quot;&amp;gt; Luckily, I documented it here&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; so you can see what the &amp;amp;quot;Safemoon Family&amp;amp;quot; thinks about people who didn&amp;amp;#39;t check every single facet of Social media before sending a fucking transaction.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In my opinion, the actions of both the Safemoon development team and the community that praises them and fiercely opposes all criticism is frankly disgusting.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;hr/&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;hr/&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;But wait, there&amp;amp;#39;s more!&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;JUST&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; the &amp;amp;quot;Transfer&amp;amp;quot; transactions, I&amp;amp;#39;m still yet to uncover purchases, sales or token swaps, which were also taxed at 100%. I will either update this post if I can figure it out tonight, or create a new one in the future.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As a closing statement, I just want to say that I hope the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rgrdlaw.com/cases-safemoon-llc-class-action-lawsuit.html&quot;&amp;gt;Class Action Lawsuit&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; fucks the Safemoon devs. This shit is worse than Bitconnect in my opinion, this is not just misleading investors (which they are due in court for), it&amp;amp;#39;s straight up theft too. I hope jailtime is doled out.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;But even then I have my doubts that it will change the minds of the Safemoon faithful&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;More than 90 lawmakers voted in favor of the proposal, according to documents seen by CoinDesk.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The proposals are intended to extend anti-money laundering (AML) requirements that apply to conventional payments over EUR 1,000 ($1,114) to the crypto sector. They also scrap the floor for crypto payments, so payers and recipients of even the smallest crypto transactions would need to be identified, including for transactions with unhosted or self-hosted wallets. Further measures under discussion could see unregulated crypto exchanges cut off from the conventional financial system.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;National governments said in December they wanted to scrap the EUR 1,000 threshold for crypto, on the basis that digital payments can easily circumvent the limit, and to include private wallets that aren’t operated by regulated crypto asset providers.
This is trash, truth be told. We need Web3 platforms like Point Network to focus more on privacy so that we will see how this type of rule works. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Members of the center-right European People&amp;amp;#39;s Party (EPP) opposed many of the more controversial changes, condemning what they called a “de facto ban of self-hosted wallets.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This write up will contain information about &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;where we are in the world&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;role Bitcoin will play&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; in it, and most fun - &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Price Predictions!&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; I&amp;amp;#39;ve spent over 1000 hours trying to wrap my head around this revolution. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Let&amp;amp;#39;s begin.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Internet has changed the world forever in such a small period of time. People forget the internet became a global sensation only in the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;1990s&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, and look how far it&amp;amp;#39;s come.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The entire &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;WORLD&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; now runs on the internet, and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;WILL&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; continue to run on the internet.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We are currently living in &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;The Exponential Age&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; at this point in history. Technology is evolving the world at a rate faster than ever before in HISTORY. Simply put, the world is moving at light speed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Shown in the graph below, the internet is the fastest developing idea/product in the entire world.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/cranvt6775r81.jpg?width=823&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=8ad30bdb8abaf44bbbba9e27180f497a50976908&quot;&amp;gt;The Exponential Age&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As a comparison, the distance of time between the creation of the Light Bulb and invention of the Internet is approximately &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;143 years apart.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; The difference between the creation and Internet and Automated Self Driving Cars (FSD) is only is only approximately &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;30 years apart.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Please let that sink in how complex it is to create AI vehicles that humans can trust to bring them to their needed destinations. Only 50 years before that we never could have even dream how to build such an idea.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;That one idea is only one of millions of innovations that&amp;amp;#39;s happened in the past couple decades.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The internet has exponentially been solving problems since inception. Examples such as Social Media, Smart Phones, Artificial Intelligence have given the world a new way to connect, and forever interact with the digital world at large.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We are at a stage in technology where the internet has a literal voice. The internet is becoming an everyday citizen of the world. Check out &amp;amp;quot;Sophia&amp;amp;quot; the robot!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/7z9x1kle75r81.png?width=711&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=50386a1c133ca4a5401936256940193d8bd40212&quot;&amp;gt;Sophia!&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now that we&amp;amp;#39;ve explained The Exponential Age, where does &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Bitcoin&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; fit in?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitcoin was created by an &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;unknown person&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; who went by the name &amp;amp;quot;Satoshi Nakamoto&amp;amp;quot; on January 3rd, 2009.  &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Satoshi&amp;amp;#39;s vision&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; was to create the first EVER proper form of &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Digital Money.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; This Digital Money needed to have a fixed supply, be secure, and permissionless. With &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Bitcoin&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, there is not a  single person in the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;world&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; that has the power to turn the system off, alter or block a transaction, or alter the max supply of this new currency.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;System never turns off&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;: Digital Money that runs 24/7 for the rest of Human and AI&amp;amp;#39;s total existence.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Be Secure&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;: It is impossible to exploit the network, change the network, or devalue the network.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Fixed Supply&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;: It is mathematically impossible to devalue the money against itself. There is no inflation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Dec. 13, 2010,&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Satoshi officially resigned from working on Bitcoin and handed the project off to the world to complete. Bitcoin&amp;amp;#39;s core values had already been set, and it was up to the world to keep it safe, secure, and forever running.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Fast forward to today, Bitcoin is running flawlessly, and is absolutely thriving in adoption. Nobody knows who Satoshi is today, or if he&amp;amp;#39;s even alive.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Currently, Bitcoin usage is growing at an exponential rate, as information about it and it’s ease of access is taking the world by storm. Check out this chart displaying how the Bitcoin adoption is growing at the same speed as the adoption of the Internet. We&amp;amp;#39;ve already hit a $50,000 BTC in 2021!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/jz8ygjrf85r81.png?width=742&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=16f2cf261ab4ca05369b9bba49f476ba1bd05553&quot;&amp;gt;Internet Adoption VS 2020 BTC Price&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We can also see the Bitcoin number of Active Addresses (Users/Wallets) increasing exponentially as the price rises (bringing more attention to the asset)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/13wptisk85r81.png?width=750&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=0bef9acec8c845d93d742583340dd88876a4ba45&quot;&amp;gt;Active Users vs BTC Price&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adoption is moving fast. But why does the world even need Bitcoin anyways?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The world technically &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;revolves&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; around Money. Money and economic incentives drive the world to be forever evolving space, as well as allow us to earn resources needed to live. Currently, the entire world is being plagued by money that is being devalued, assets that are being inflated, and people who are losing faith in the current system. People are getting desperate, they’re looking for an alternative, it’s getting bad.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitcoin is the solution to these peoples problem, and very fast are many starting to notice. If you&amp;amp;#39;re reading this in 2022, check how &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;EARLY&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; we are, and how exponential we are about to grow. Congratulations to all BTC holders out there. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/qn8z2e3r95r81.png?width=649&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=1a6b9c383aff593ff1505f1e98f1ffa344e2904c&quot;&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s about to get crazy.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Billionaires are buying it, country’s are adopting it as an official currency, the US government is accepting it for tax payments, and the world is trying to go greener to acquire it. The list goes on. This is all happening within a short decade. The demand for Bitcoin will only continue to accelerate from here. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The toothpaste cannot be put back in the tube. Bitcoin is taking the world by surprise and there is no stopping it. The world’s finally taking advantage of this fair, secure, and incorruptible money. The world is learning to store its wealth on the Bitcoin network. It is a &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;black hole&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; sucking up the world&amp;amp;#39;s corrupt, controlling, and unlimited supply of Government money. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;People are taking back control of what hard earned money is all about.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Bitcoin is digital gold, it is financial freedom, and it is the future of economic energy.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Theoretically, because Government money has an unlimited supply, the price of Dollars per Bitcoin can go to infinity when compared to it as Bitcoin has a max supply. So why do we want to get in early?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The reality is, governments cannot stop printing money. It is impossible to stop printing money, and with Bitcoin having a forever fixed supply of 21 million coins, it mathematically will 100% continue to rise in value against a currency that has a maximum supply of infinity, assuming there is demand for Bitcoin. (The strongest currency)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Read what I said above again. The price of Bitcoin is literally going to &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;infinity&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; against the dollar. Bitcoin is number go up technology against ALL currencies of the world.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/u8rv3xvm65r81.png?width=1246&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=9fdb5e06b8c92c8bda06e2400b5cc03a9095a86d&quot;&amp;gt;USD vs BTC over time&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Year after year, dollars are purchasing less, and Bitcoins are purchasing more. Bitcoin is exponentially increasing in purchasing power. Bitcoin mathematically is the strongest currency in the world. It is a perfect place to store long term wealth, and exchange economic value with another entity.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The question that lead many of us down the Bitcoin rabbit hole is, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;how high can Bitcoin price go?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;In Short, the price per Bitcoin valued against the Dollar should be anywhere between $500,000 and $4,600,000.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That&amp;amp;#39;s right, Bitcoin is EASILY going to 1 MILLION DOLLARS a coin by 2030. We are so early. The world has a lot of money in it. The world&amp;amp;#39;s money is beginning to fly into Bitcoin as we speak.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/12r5kf7xd5r81.png?width=1309&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=a3c412f2e88af206e218bf174a03eb32c53f71a3&quot;&amp;gt;Public Companies holding BTC&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The chart above will show us that Public Companies are beginning to HORDE Bitcoin, as they see it as an essential asset to hold on the balance sheet of their business. Many of these companies are taking Bitcoins off the market, and they will NEVER return or be resold for dollars.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitcoin is the easiest asset to maintain, and the greatest asset to hold over a long period of time. Everyone is making a lot of money off this. Everyone needs a piece of it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The kicker is, we are going into a transformational time in history. Inflation rates are at record highs, reaching 10% a year in most of the world. (This is conservative) &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Global BOND market is worth approximately $100T. All this money placed in bonds is literally LOSING investors money. If inflation is at 10%, and you are earning 2% on your bonds, you are &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;safely&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; losing 8% a year on your investment. The math is that simple, and it is that sad.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We can now say at least 30T of these bonds are smart enough to notice within the next couple years that the money placed inside them need a new home, the whole Crypto industry and Bitcoin itself is that black hole that is going to suck up a large portion of it. (Crypto Industry is currently only worth $2.5T at the time of writing this)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;With all this money coming, and adoption growing exponentially, what prices per Bitcoin could we expect?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Maybe this is something for you to study yourself, but I&amp;amp;#39;ll give you an idea of models and ideas to study to get you on the right track.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;These Price Projections, Models, and MATH have been provided by&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;James from InvestAnswers&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;. Check him out on YouTube!&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClgJyzwGs-GyaNxUHcLZrkg&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClgJyzwGs-GyaNxUHcLZrkg&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Price Projections by 2030&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Metcalfes Law: $11M per BTC&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Stock to Flow: $9.5M per BTC&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Fidelity and ARKK Invest PP: $1M&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Average of all the models: $4.6M&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Expected Case: $1.9M&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I like to give conservatives price predictions for BTC. Realistically, any of these could be correct. The math just works, it&amp;amp;#39;s not hopium, it&amp;amp;#39;s not inaccurate, this is REALISTIC.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;I expect a $1M Bitcoin by 2030, and I have put my money where my mouth is.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The question is, should you invest? Yes. NFA!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Take a leap of faith, this is all very possible, and will likely happen.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/hjq549o0j5r81.png?width=535&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e74c8107fbf7f7ec2450bf3330b9d62439813a6f&quot;&amp;gt;A leap of faith!&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Keep in mind, Purchasing Power of $1M in 2030 will not be $1M. This is true because of how inflationary the dollar is. See below what happens when BTC = $1M a coin with varies inflation rates. This is why we need sound money that does not devalue against itself. (Bitcoin if you haven&amp;amp;#39;t understood that yet)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/np1lcfgri5r81.png?width=912&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=754b0ea12aea22c8fadc2ca8892b2de47b8d56ce&quot;&amp;gt;Chart from InvestAnswers&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Get ready to see Bitcoin being accepted as payments at all your local stores, and sent between all your friends. It&amp;amp;#39;s only up from here. Bitcoin and Crypto as an industry is a 50X opportunity from here over the next decade or two. This $2.5T asset class is going to $100T. (Similar to the Stock Market and Real Estate total market)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Study hard, study often, pick the right assets, and enjoy the gains.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The question is: &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;WHEN MOON?&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Stack your bags, do your DD, and happy investing!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Again, NFA!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/997hxwx2g5r81.png?width=784&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=63a993d3425629ee6e9be7588e7fe471c0dcbd5c&quot;&amp;gt;Bitcoin in El Salvador&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I am not able to stash some money from my paychecks so I can invest while the market was in a bear market...to be fair, right now I am losing money on a monthly basis. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Luckily I had some emergency funds ready, but that budget is almost gone because of the high gas, heat and food prices in my country. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My portfolio is not looking that good, but I am happy with my picks and I am sure I will get some serious returns on that investment in the longterm. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I don&amp;amp;#39;t want to sell, but if this keeps up, I will have to...and I don&amp;amp;#39;t like that idea at all. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Market experienced a brief dive before recovering to an even higher cap amid EU aggressive new regulations on private wallets.
This shows how bullish the market is as it grows more and more even tho so many bad news (federal interest rate hike and upcoming US crypto regulations) recently hit the market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;ETH briefly reached 3500$ today before retreating to 3480$. Almost every major coin is gaining.
Near gained more than 20%, Graph 14%, Flow and Aave both more than 13% and Terra and Tezos and Arweave and SOL more than 10%!!!
A fantastic day for cryptomarket indeed!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fantom also recovered more than 10% and now is at 1.67$. and people were saying it is dead. A truly remarkable recovery from previous dive to 1$.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Enjoy everyone . You deserve it and more.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: apparently ban is a rather strong and inaccurate definition and I apologize for using it. First of all it is not yet in full effect and needs confirmation from other bodies of European union. And it is more like mandatory KYC for using private wallets.
I thank those who pointed it out.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When I was young my father left and my whole family became homeless. For the past 5 years I have lived in my car and worked at the lowest paying dead end jobs.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Right now I don&amp;amp;#39;t have a job. You may ask why and the reason is when you are working a dead end job that won&amp;amp;#39;t give you a raise you make more money quitting and taking a few weeks to find a job paying $1 more per hour.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I can make enough to afford an apartment but because the rent price means they require 3X rent as your income... I don&amp;amp;#39;t make enough for that.... So I can&amp;amp;#39;t get an apartment.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I have worked and quit and worked and quit and repeat.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Right now My goal is to save up $30,000 and invest it in Bitcoin. That means if Bitcoin becomes 500K then I&amp;amp;#39;ll have $300,000... And I can retire with that in the Philippines.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I can theoretically save $15000 in a year working while living in my car so I plan on investing ALL of it in Bitcoin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
