&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Could it be the Russia invasion of Ukraine coming to an end? XRP winning the court case against SEC? Bitcoin being declared as part of a big company&amp;amp;#39;s balance sheet? Or could we have to wait as long as the next bitcoin halving in 2024?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The reason is most centralised exchanges don’t allow you to withdraw XMR under fake technical reasons. Meanwhile, XMR deposits are always welcome and available.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Later, users of other cryptos recognised they can’t withdraw their funds due to fake power of liquidity. Although anonymous cryptos are affected first, some time other types of crypto were touched.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This insane situation is made possible because large centralised exchanges trend to have fake liquidity at all. That’s because their economical nature is to generate profit dependent on your buy/sell operations: no buy/sell leads to no profit. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And because crypto exchanges are not properly regulated as traditional asset exchanges, they practice to simply generate inexistent “paper” coins. You can easily trade these coins but if you try to withdraw them, you fail.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Most corrupt exchanges in that sense of “paper” coins are Binance, Huobi and Poloniex. Please don’t use that exchanges at all in the future and prepare to migrate from them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On April 18 2022, just try to withdraw all your crypto from all centralised exchanges and hence check whether exchanges of your choice do trade “paper” coins or not. If so, you can’t withdraw. Blacklist that exchanges and broadcast them to all your friends in all social media.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is extremely easy experiment, just perform your own test!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you ask where to migrate from Binance, Huobi and Poloniex, consider the following list:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s never a good idea to talk anything finance with friends and family if it&amp;amp;#39;s something outside of very general subjects.

But as much as I hate to admit it, I&amp;amp;#39;m bored.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Everything is predictable,  I know Bitcoins gonna be crabbing till it breaks 50K, and even then it&amp;amp;#39;s only luck if we can sustain the profit takers and push to another all-time high. I&amp;amp;#39;m not invested enough to be happy when BTC reaches a new all-time high, but I&amp;amp;#39;m also not sad if BTC crashes to 20K.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So how did you guys who managed to go through multiple bear markets stay in the &amp;amp;quot;game&amp;amp;quot;. I would be pleased to learn some tips should you have any.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: I forgot to mention that I have a life outside of crypto and it&amp;amp;#39;s one of the reasons I&amp;amp;#39;m bored, I find it hard to come back to crypto and do some research on new coins, tech, etc. I don&amp;amp;#39;t feel motivated at all, so all these comments about &amp;amp;quot;getting a life&amp;amp;quot; isn&amp;amp;#39;t helping.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Pipelining – or more precisely, diffusion pipelining – is an improvement to the consensus layer that facilitates faster block propagation. It enables even greater gains in headroom, which will enable further increases to Cardano’s performance and competitiveness.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Pipelining is just one of the pillars supporting Cardano’s scaling this year. Combined, all these changes will lead Cardano to a position where it is faster than its competitors, and a highly competitive platform for decentralized finance (DeFi) this year.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Expect June to be a month of innovation and change for the Cardano ecosystem.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You see, as long as you lose money, its all fun and games. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But when the average guys finds a way to make just a little more than what the government allows them to make, they have to be shut down using the entire force of the regulatoooors who want to protect you from earning more than what banks allow you. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The 7% rate offered by Celsius or Blockfi isnt even inflation beating, in the era of &amp;amp;gt; 8% CPI. But you cant earn that unless you are accredited.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Monero&amp;amp;#39;s obfuscated ledger has enabled a number of  exchanges to misrepresent their reserves, and sell XMR that they don&amp;amp;#39;t actually have, knowing that all too many of us will never withdraw, and no one can see onchain the evidence of their misdeeds.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Well that all changes in 4 days. We&amp;amp;#39;re busy pulling liquidity off exchanges, to force the issue. Already a number of exchanges have frozen XMR withdraws.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Personally I&amp;amp;#39;ve got a little side pot ready to go on the 18th. When the tide goes out, we&amp;amp;#39;ll see which exchanges serve their customers, and which exchanges abuse their customers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Of course there were the standard answers like buy a car, go on holiday etc. but in a class of 20 students aged 13-17 there were 3 who said they would buy cryptocurrency, with one naming bitcoin specifically. I was really surprised to see that so I asked them about it after class and I was shocked by their knowledge. I assumed they&amp;amp;#39;d all love SHIB or whatever coin Jake Paul is shilling now but they knew about shitcoins, staking and different exchanges. Obviously they&amp;amp;#39;re all too young to invest at the moment but they said they were always trying to convince their parents to do so on their behalf.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Long story short, it gave me a lot of faith that crypto knowledge and adoption among the younger generation is much higher than I previously thought.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Even as careful as I am it seems that my email I have been using for the last 15 years has been found on an auction block on the dark web.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Low and behold the culprit is &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://robinhood.com/&quot;&amp;gt;r&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;obinhood. I literally used them for 2 months, realized I did not like the platform, then the GME and AMC bullshit and the shady practices with the hedge fund, then the wallet bullshit where you couldn&amp;amp;#39;t sell your crypto. After all that it just made me hate them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Luckily before I got this heads up I had already began converting my accounts into a different email and I regularly update my passwords. This was by chance that i did the new email. Very happy I did&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;if I didn&amp;amp;#39;t have enough reasons to not like RH this is the icing on the cake.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fuck robinhood. Update your passwords, get a new email and stay away from this shit show.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;People are already getting notices asking to explain their crypto activity, and being asked to submit all evidence including all your bank statements from several past years. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The govt is asking you to explain all your crypto activities and track all your wallets. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These activities are an illegal exercise conducted by the government where the centralised exchanges are playing along, violating the right to privacy of citizens. The law protects people against unauthorised searches and seizures, without any warrant. Users of CEX are not performing any illegal activity, and there is no probable cause to effect seizure of everyone&amp;amp;#39;s data. Yet the CEX have happily turned over people&amp;amp;#39;s data to the government, who is now coming after crypto traders. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is possible that one or two users may engage in illegal activity, but that does not allow the government to seize everyone&amp;amp;#39;s data under suspicion. These are draconian violations of privacy.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

And that very understandable no human would like to see weeks of very red bleeding and every attempt of relief completly fail. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At such situations where everyone is just so sad that they can&amp;amp;#39;t even watch the charts anymore or even talk about Crypto. That&amp;amp;#39;s when you know we are truely in some bearish sentiment. But a bearish sentiment is probably the best thing, as the bears become very overconfident that everything is under control but in Crypto nothing every is in anyone&amp;amp;#39;s hands.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also looking at the history the past big bull runs started after everyone was not even thinking about a pump but just about a further dumb. One thing to akwys remember is that a bear run only happens when we can not imagine it going down any day soon and a bulk run happens when we can not imagine it going up any time soon.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now this is probably going on with every major Centralized exchange due to the fact that people are greedy and will take advantage of any opportunity to make more money. what  options do we have?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I have some stuff on Conbase and am planning on moving it to a non-custodial wallet this week, I had planned to leave it in Conbase to be able to sell easily but with the way the past couple of months have gone I&amp;amp;#39;m just going to hold it for a while. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A recent example is the supposed &amp;amp;quot;delay&amp;amp;quot; in Ethereum&amp;amp;#39;s merge. You can&amp;amp;#39;t delay something that never had an agreed upon date. Rather then saying it how is, with Ethereum devs getting closer to a finalized date for the merge, misleading titles get upvoted by people seeking confirmation bias rather then trying to understand what is actually going on in the development process. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It applies to Cardano the same way it applies to Ethereum and any other project. You&amp;amp;#39;ll never succeed in crypto if you keep trying to prove your biases right and refuse to see things for what they actually are.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When prices started dropping I realized I was checking the charts quite a lot. It was the last thing I did before going to sleep and the first thing I did when I woke up. The prices going down were nagging at me a lot more than I anticipated at first.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I decided to take out my initial investment and some extra profits if I wanted to go on a vacation with some friends. Since I did that, I barely check the charts anymore and to be honest I feel no stress at all when prices drop.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This made me wonder how many of you their mental health truly stays unaffected by the prices dropping and truly invested only what you can &amp;amp;#39;afford&amp;amp;#39; to lose?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit 1: I’m trying to reply to everyone but damn you all are going hard with the replies!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit 2: I agree “afford” to lose is a really ambiguous and weird term. That’s why I put it between brackets!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

It offers numerous services to cryptocurrency investors and other market players. According to DeFi LIama, the total locked-in value (TVL) in DeFi protocols today is $209.2 billion. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;From lending and borrowing to yield farming, from high APY staking protocols to margin trading, DeFi is ultimately transforming into one of the most desirable, go-to solutions for private investors, institutions, crypto VCs and retailers. With so many new, alternative value propositions being architected on almost a daily basis, DeFi is set to become the quintessential disruptor of 21st century finance. Due to its importance, this post will touch on an aspect of DeFi, which is lending. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cryptocurrency trading and speculation is at the heart of cryptocurrency lending. There is a high demand for cryptocurrency borrowing because hedge funds and a number of investors have found that they can make money by betting leveraged on tokens and crypto derivatives. Because these players can make significant amounts with their trading strategies, they can afford to pay intermediaries high rates for borrowing cryptocurrency. And today often a large number of investors and traders trade their assets in pair to stablecoins like Binance USD, Teather, USD Coin. These payments, net of profits, go to regular crypto investors in the form of returns that far exceed what they would get from bank deposits. Defi lending platforms aim to offer crypto loans in a trustless manner, i.e., without intermediaries. A borrower can directly take a loan through the decentralized platform. Among all of the decentralized applications (DApps), Defi has the highest lending growth rate and is the most prevalent contributor for locking crypto assets. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the past few years, the marketplace has seen even more valuable and innovative decentralized lending platforms. The ability to lend and borrow assets among completely open applications has created a fundamental breakthrough for the future of finance and cryptocurrency.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here are some of the topmost decentralized lending platforms you should know about.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;1. Aave&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is an open-source and one of the most popular Defi lending protocols launched in 2020. It is a non-custodial liquidity protocol for earning interests on deposit and borrowing assets. This platform allows lenders to deposit cryptocurrencies in a pool and receive an equivalent amount of aTokens. Aave algorithmically adjusts interest rates depending on demand and supply. It indicates that the more the user holds aTokens, the better the interest amount.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If users are looking to use the Aave protocol, users first deposit the chosen asset and amount. Shortly after, the lender will earn passive income based on the market borrowing demand. Additionally, depositing assets allows consumers the ability to borrow by using the deposited assets as collateral. The interest you earn by depositing funds may help offset the interest rate users accumulate by borrowing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/ja8uolr5a9t81.png?width=2880&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e7a711330665be2c031cdfd2876b5755ed0cd52b&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/ja8uolr5a9t81.png?width=2880&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e7a711330665be2c031cdfd2876b5755ed0cd52b&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Aave offers users many advantages. Financial protocols boast transparency, and that benefits many users. When it comes to lending and borrowing, everything is clear and straightforward, even for those new to the cryptocurrency market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You don&amp;amp;#39;t have to think about the processes we see in traditional systems that don&amp;amp;#39;t allow access to their processes. They use your funds in a way that benefits them, but they don&amp;amp;#39;t want to share the profits with you. However, Aave exposes your processes to your community so you know everything that&amp;amp;#39;s going on in the network.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some features of Aave:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;1) Aave is an open-source project&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The good thing about open source code is that many people look at it and work tirelessly to keep it free of vulnerabilities.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;2) Variety of credit pools&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can choose from 10 markets, each offering a different APY and a selection of different coins.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;3) Aave does not store cryptocurrencies&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This benefit is great for investors who worry about hackers. Because the protocol uses a &amp;amp;quot;non-storage&amp;amp;quot; approach to its transactions, users are safe. Even if a cybercriminal breaks into the network, he/she cannot steal the cryptocurrency because there is nothing to steal.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;4) Aave protocol is a private&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Like other decentralized protocols, Aave does not require KYC / AML (know your customer and anti-money laundering) filings. The platforms do not work with intermediaries. Thus, all of these processes become unnecessary. Users who keep their privacy above all else can invest in the platform without compromising themselves.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;2. Alchemix&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Alchemix is a DeFi loan-based platform that uses a new method to provide loans that “pay themselves back over time.” Users deposit DAI into a smart contract. In exchange, users receive a token that represents the deposit’s future yield farming potential. The token used through Alchemix is known as alUSD, which can be transmuted for DAI within the Alchemix platform and traded on a given DeFi exchange.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Once funds are deposited, the funds are used to generate income, which will eventually automatically repay the user&amp;amp;#39;s debt . However, there are several ways in which the user can manage their credit:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Option 1: leave their deposit to earn income all the time, allowing them to periodically withdraw the collateral on the loan.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Option 2: Repay the loan early using alUSD or DAI, allowing them to remove the collateral&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Option 3: liquidate their loan using some of their collateral to pay off the loan and allow them to withdraw what&amp;amp;#39;s left.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/ka1tsx87a9t81.png?width=2880&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=a91fd31a92344396486ffa624efbaa5c5c3adff1&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/ka1tsx87a9t81.png?width=2880&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=a91fd31a92344396486ffa624efbaa5c5c3adff1&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;V1 provided users with a single source of income limiting repayment options. Alchemix version 2 is continually expanding the range of yield options available, making it a key lego in the DeFi stack. If a new app comes along that offers competitive returns, we will be able to quickly capture it, which will be mutually beneficial for both us and the protocol we integrate.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In addition, v2 gives users the ability to determine in detail which yield strategies support their loans, allowing them to create their own yield aggregators on top of Alchemix. More conservative investors can choose safer and more stable yield options, while more aggressive investors may prefer to take more risk by choosing other, less established options with highly variable rates.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some Theses and Features of Alchemix Finance: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;1) Alchemix Synthetic Stablecoin (alUSD)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When users deposit DAI into the Alchemix platform, they receive alUSD in return. As per security measures on the platform, there are limits in place on the amount of alUSD that can be minted from DAI assets.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;2) Vaults&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At the heart of the Alchemix Finance protocol are the vaults, operating through smart contracts. At the moment there are 4 vaults with stablecoins. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;3) Pegging mechanism for synthetic tokens&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All harvested yield flows through the Transmuter, which helps maintain a guaranteed redemption of 1:1 for alUSD and DAI. Moreover, users can choose to stake the synthetic stablecoin in the Transmuter, which will automatically convert yield into the base asset (DAI). When staked, alUSD acts like a bond, eventually maturing into a base asset. When users decide to withdraw their converted DAI, the protocol burns an equivalent amount of the Alchemix stablecoin, alUSD.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;4) Alchemix DAO&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Alchemix decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is a community of enthusiasts working collaboratively to grow and develop the Alchemix ecosystem. The DAO also receives funding through the yield generated through the Alchemix protocol, split between the treasury funds. Whereas the treasury fund is responsible for covering the finances of operations, the Alchemix DAO focuses its funding on development. However, any movement of funds is subject to governance from the DAO. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;3. WOWswap&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;WOWswap is a fully community-owned protocol based on a simple idea: liquidity providers can create a liquidity pool, and traders can borrow these funds to buy up to 5 times more tokens. It is built on Ethereum, Solana, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Binance Smart Chain, IoTeX, Polygon and HECO Chain. Protocol fees, interest rates for lenders and borrowers, liquidation ratios and other settings are decided by holders of WOW tokens — our governance token. Making a WOW swap is as easy as making a regular swap on Uniswap or Pancakeswap — extra capital will be automatically borrowed from the liquidity pool.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When a trader opens a leveraged trading position (long or short), the trader takes a loan from the liquidity pool at a current Hourly Interest Rate (HIR). Therefore, to make leveraged trading possible Liquidity Providers (LP) need to maintain enough liquidity in liquidity pools. Anyone can become a liquidity provider by supplying liquidity to the liquidity pools.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/bidfz9v8a9t81.png?width=2880&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=feef161a9900abcaa9690523e824fdc7ba01fc27&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/bidfz9v8a9t81.png?width=2880&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=feef161a9900abcaa9690523e824fdc7ba01fc27&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Into the second half of 2021, WOWswap had already accomplished much of its initial roadmap, including a liquidation bot, instant governance, a recruitment smart contract, enabled leveraged short swaps, and worked out a DAO governance model. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As a way of maximum capitalization of yields, the platform launched an effective yield aggregator that would allow yield farmers to farm rewards on other DeFi protocols. This is because just a handful of pool tokens are active, while over 75% of the rest remain inactive.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For the platform to improve efficiency around the yield aggregator, the platform will take in rewards from more than one protocol. As a matter of fact, the platform favors highly secure protocols as a means of ensuring funds are protected from cyber terrorists. Remember, DeFi protocols have lost around $14 million to hackers within the last year. Hence, security is paramount to any trading protocol.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The development team found it ideal to allow yield farmers to lend a percentage of their dormant assets and reap more rewards. Thereby, boosting the APY from 10% or 15% to 50%. This implies that traders on WOWswap will gain 50% more in APR compared to other leverage trading protocols.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Besides, the protocol also plans to allow users to burn their tokens and gain rewards.  By executing a successful leverage position on the platform, traders will pay a fee that will automatically represent their vote in community governance. While the fees were currently held in the treasury, presently, they are staked to allow for decentralized voting. Meanwhile, the rest of the tokens are distributed to holders of xWOW.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;WOWswap has a number of features and advantages over competitors:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;1) Successful audit by Hacken&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These audit results showed that there were no critical points in the original smart contract they released and highlighted a few more measures that they took to decrease their already low risks to the barest minimum.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;2) Over 200+ coins for making deals &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Lend your coins to traders and receive reward in the form of interest payments of their trades and also you can open long and short positions yourself using leverage up to 5x. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;3) WOWswap Alerts&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;High APY Alerts, that alert WOWswap users when any of the tokens in the lending pool accumulates 20, 50, or 100% profits. This helps get insights on the most profitable pools to lend to.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;4) WOW Governance Model&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Governance is a mechanism, through which holders of WOW-token can change important protocol’s parameters, as well as submit and accept WOW improvement proposals. Everyone, who participates in the Governance, receives Governance rewards, which calculated as a percentage of the protocol’s total revenue.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;5) xWOW token&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;xWOW token is used for voting and Governance reward distribution. Governance rewards are distributed proportionally among all xWOW holders. Staking by itself is sufficient to get Governance rewards, no actual voting is required.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Conclusion&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This detailed discussion shows that DeFi lending has a high potential to reshape the entire financial system. DeFi lending being involved with the intriguing technology truly has vast opportunities to revolutionize the global financial landscape.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
