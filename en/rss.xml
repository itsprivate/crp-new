&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So what does this c#ck head do…….creates Luna 2.0. This is a regulators wet dream. The optics on this whole thing are so incredibly bad.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To ALL of the exchanges out there who listed this token……you fucked up. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Not only do the regulators have hard on for flogs like Do Kwon, but you are in their crosshairs even more now. Exchanges literally listed the exit pump token for Do Kwon’s initial ponzi. Utterly psychotic. Like how can they be so stupid.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Exchanges should have denied the listing of Luna 2.0. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is why we are so far away from full scale adoption. It’s bullshit like this and maybe it’s time for the regs to come in and clean this bullshit up. A lot of people lost a lot of money in the last couple of weeks, Do Kwon is causing more and more damage every day he is active in the crypto asset class.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

While people still invest in bitcoin hoping to cash out for fiat, you can be sure bitcoin will not decouple from fiat currency, and you&amp;amp;#39;ll see the &amp;amp;quot;value&amp;amp;quot; of it move with other markets tied to fiat (although we all know the real value is priceless)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We know the central banking system is collapsing. The ship is sinking and they cannot keep it afloat much longer. Decades of manipulation and Bipolar policy has damaged fiat beyond repair. It&amp;amp;#39;s going to zero, as it has in many areas of the world already. When you buy bitcoin you should understand you&amp;amp;#39;re betting against the central banks. You&amp;amp;#39;re betting against fiat currency altogether. You&amp;amp;#39;re expressing your desire to see this decentralized monetary system become the standard, so you should expect to have to hold for a decade or several decades to see the vision come true. Once the fiat currency system finally collapses for good (and it will) your Bitcoin will be the only life raft you have. It will be the only life raft anyone has, and then you&amp;amp;#39;ll see everything else valued in satoshis. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Do you think the world is going back to trading physical gold when fiat finally collapses? I don&amp;amp;#39;t think so. In today&amp;amp;#39;s world technology is important and convenience. The world will choose bitcoin when central banking dies. Get on the boat and don&amp;amp;#39;t sell your bitcoin for any shitcoins especially the ultimate shitcoin USD.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You know what does go to the moon? Layoffs, interest rates, political and social strife, corruption, disease, death. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That&amp;amp;#39;s what to prepare for. Have a safety net of some kind. Do you have savings for if you or your partner(s) get laid off? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What do you do if the place you&amp;amp;#39;re renting gets sold off to cover some landlord&amp;amp;#39;s margin, and the new buyer raises your rents past what you can afford?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Do you have skills and network and savings to survive if suddenly your luck goes worse for 3-6 months?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If not, that&amp;amp;#39;s where to focus. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Learn from the past. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I do not know what is going to make me rich, but I am dam good at seeing what is not going to make me rich.   Luna isn&amp;amp;#39;t one of them.    I&amp;amp;#39;m sure it will go up and give some sense to people that there is still hope.  Hey, some may even be able to make 10x before it goes through it&amp;amp;#39;s final crash shortly after but you can do the same thing with shitcoins.  So other than trying to time that risky market, you really aren&amp;amp;#39;t going anywhere sticking around with Luna.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I know die hard Luna fans don&amp;amp;#39;t want to hear it but
It&amp;amp;#39;s a nose hair away from reaching official shitcoin status.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;ll try and do a super quick catch up with no added fluff.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Safemoon has a &amp;amp;quot;locked&amp;amp;quot; liquidity pool, meaning they can&amp;amp;#39;t just withdraw the BNB or Safemoon tokens. It&amp;amp;#39;s locked til 2025.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s one of several LP&amp;amp;#39;s, which aren&amp;amp;#39;t locked.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;They moved from V1 token to V2, with a new unaudited contract&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The moving process is widely considered a honeypot, with investor losses tallying over $5m due to being taxed 100% if you don&amp;amp;#39;t move in exactly the right way.&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/uigey5/4899739_a_complete_view_of_the_safemoon_v1_100/&quot;&amp;gt;(see previous post)&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;hr/&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So May 11th was a very perilous time for Safemoon holders. Amidst the deepening bear market and failure of the Mandala launch (&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/STK65dO&quot;&amp;gt;$17 bucks in 24hr volume&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;), Safemoon&amp;amp;#39;s token price had dropped 48% in week to make a new low on the 11th of just $0.000289 per token (a 98% loss from the V1 ATH of $0.014 - price adjusted for V2)  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Safemoon LLC posted this statement;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/923316772227153957/974075451888767046/FSgkCRvWQAEDySj.jpg?width=1618&amp;amp;amp;height=910&quot;&amp;gt;In connection with the migration of SFMV1 to SFMV2, SafeMoon is seeking to migrate BNB held in LPs associated with SFMV1 into LPs associated with SFMV2. In connection with that migration, SafeMoon may from time to time acquire SFMV2 in the open market, subject to market conditions and other factors.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All of a sudden, Safemoon pumped 274% in a few hours.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;What the fuck happened there?&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You know that locked Liquidity pool? That&amp;amp;#39;s only half the story. There are many other unlocked LP&amp;amp;#39;s, and the Safemoon developers have been dipping their dirty little hands in and scooping out the liquidity.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Let&amp;amp;#39;s be clear here.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;SAFEMOON LLC ARE THE CUSTODIANS OF THESE FUNDS, THEY DO NOT OWN THESE TOKENS&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Safemoon LLC, and other Cryptocurrency tokens (in the DeFi space or otherwise) get funds like this:  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Pre-sale - selling minted tokens directly for ETH, BNB etc.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Selling tokens minted throughout the token&amp;amp;#39;s life&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Collecting fees etc.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With Safemoon LLC, they held a &amp;amp;quot;&amp;amp;quot;&amp;amp;quot;Fair Launch&amp;amp;quot;&amp;amp;quot;&amp;amp;quot; where tokens were not advertised in any capacity and yet they managed to secure thousands of dollars worth of BNB. They also have the famed 10% buy and 10% sell tax, where a portion of fees are allocated to devs. Other than that, they have no other ways to accumulate funds.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Apart from the liquidity pool.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When people buy and sell Safemoon, it&amp;amp;#39;s done through the liquidity pool which contains a pairing of tokens. X Safemoon per 1 BNB, which dictates the price. Those tokens come from the community. They are not Safemoon LLC&amp;amp;#39;s tokens. When Safemoon sells Mike 1,000,000 Safemoon tokens, and then Mike sells those tokens for 1 BNB to someone else, Safemoon LLC doesn&amp;amp;#39;t own that 1,000,000 Safemoon or the 1 BNB.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;hr/&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;Within minutes of posting the above on Twitter &amp;amp;amp; Discord, Safemoon LLC started dumping V1 tokens by the trillions.&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here is one such transaction, the wallet ending in 76bc is known as the &amp;amp;quot;CFO wallet&amp;amp;quot; (and since Safemoon has no CFO any more, it&amp;amp;#39;s John Karony the CEO)  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://bscscan.com/tx/0x1bdf563996ead8cc0c915d109f91ac96e3798b5b4c07b801d279944a76432b91&quot;&amp;gt;In this transaction, 2.4 Trillion V1 Tokens were swapped for 883 BNB worth $276.8K.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In total, this wallet extracted 37 Trillion V1 tokens and 22,894 BNB from the unlocked V1 Liquidity pool, in addition to &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://bscscan.com/tx/0x79ce08720b3ab4507bd036a43a2c2f9274eb2156dc3d0622647746ada9defd80&quot;&amp;gt;withdrawing 2,296 BNB from a Binance Hot Wallet&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That&amp;amp;#39;s 25,190 BNB.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;$7,896,480&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And what was done with this BNB? Minutes after accumulating $8 Million bucks of investors money, Safemoon LLC bought  7,965,639,635 Safemoon V2 tokens on the open market, spiking the price up nearly 4x over, which of course...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/mvBBDMa.png&quot;&amp;gt;A whale immediately took advantage of and thanked John &amp;amp;amp; Co. for the exit liquidity.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The problem here is that Safemoon LLC neglected to move the LP in a proper manner. They could have just withdrawn the BNB &amp;amp;amp; V1 tokens, burned the V1 as they&amp;amp;#39;re obsolete, then simply deposited the BNB in the V2 Liquidity Pool.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Instead, the CEO chose to buy V2 tokens on the open market - inflating the price of the asset, while securing almost 8 Billion V2 tokens for himself. The CEO has therefore enriched himself at the holders expense.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://np.reddit.com/r/SafeMoon/comments/unr2is/believe_in_john_believe_in_his_team_i_told_you/&quot;&amp;gt;And yet, all over Twitter, Reddit &amp;amp;amp; Discord, folks are praising him for &amp;amp;quot;4D Chess&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;WARNING: Link will melt your brain&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. Their CEO has enriched himself using money that should be meant for the liquidity pool, provided exit liquidity for a whale and opened themselves up to even more legal action. And they are thanking him for it.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/84tbhiiiauz81.jpg?width=1024&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=9adb13d58c9a8a782a5b60811c85235ff1dd6f0b&quot;&amp;gt;Oh, and he clearly has no intention of returning it to all the poor people who lost their funds on the ruthless 100% tax.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Insane.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

If you haven&amp;amp;#39;t already, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/lawrencewintermeyer/2022/05/25/from-hero-to-zero-how-terra-was-toppled-in-cryptos-darkest-hour/?sh=685a29e389e2&quot;&amp;gt;here&amp;amp;#39;s how it went down&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;: Luna plummeted 100% after its stable coin depegged from $1.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It appears that UST/LUNA was attacked, but how did this happen? Well… maybe if you hadn&amp;amp;#39;t declared to the world how to precisely implode your coin and told billionaires to &amp;amp;quot;try it&amp;amp;quot;, then maybe this wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t have happened LOL.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But here’s the interesting part… &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Immediately after LUNA&amp;amp;#39;s downfall, there was a &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://i.redd.it/f1rvti5wury81.jpg&quot;&amp;gt;post&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; claiming that Blackrock and Citadel had borrowed 100k BTC and exchanged 25k for UST which dried up most of its liquidity. After that, it&amp;amp;#39;s thought they threw the remaining 75k on the market, causing Luna to implode.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This was a pure profit play if a short was opened at the top. Do Kwon (CEO) (probably) fell for the 25k BTC trade bait and accidentally was responsible for his currency&amp;amp;#39;s fate. Again this is just theory.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The process is fairly easy and will cost you surprisingly little, the entire process cost me only 15 ALGOs and I could still withdraw most of that out of the wallet I created for this project. I decided to use Algorand for this due to it&amp;amp;#39;s ease of use and low fees.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Step one: The Wallet&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Create a Pera Wallet and transfer around 15 ALGO into it. (around $5.00 USD)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Pera wallet is available on Android and IOS, you can also use any other ALGO wallet you prefer.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Step Two: Creating the Algorand Standard Asset&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Head on over to &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://algodesk.io&quot;&amp;gt;algodesk.io&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and connect said wallet.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;click on the top right button labeled &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;create asset,&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; you will get the following box pop up. fill in the required information and confirm the transaction on you wallet. (this fee I believe is around 1 ALGO)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;For this example I decided to create the shittiest shit coin I could think of so its called ButtCoinASA in honor of&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/Buttcoin&quot;&amp;gt;r/Buttcoin&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/08a2w3mpgw191.png?width=955&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=9ca17782da4c0bc41ef1e7f3f51a8b7c7f5d3283&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/08a2w3mpgw191.png?width=955&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=9ca17782da4c0bc41ef1e7f3f51a8b7c7f5d3283&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Congratulations, you are now the proud owner of your very own ALGO ASA&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Step Three: Providing Liquidity&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So now you have this new asset in your wallet but its not really known to the world, what to do?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Visit Algorands best DEX called &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://tinyman.org&quot;&amp;gt;tinyman.org&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; then follow the steps below.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;connect wallet&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;click on the tab labeled &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;pool&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;click create pair&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;select Algo and (your new ASA), you&amp;amp;#39;ll have to search for it and click on the box labeled &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;hide unverified assets&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/p8seesx5jw191.png?width=785&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=dc79bdbee1136fccac25bae73ab6a4836c73b5ec&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/p8seesx5jw191.png?width=785&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=dc79bdbee1136fccac25bae73ab6a4836c73b5ec&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;now add as much ALGO and your ASA as you want (this will give it your initial value, if you add 1 ALGO and one ButtCoin then 1 ALGO = 1 Butt)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Congrats, your ShitCoin now has some value&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;wait about thirty minutes and then head on over to &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://tinychart.org&quot;&amp;gt;tinychart.org&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/gtfprjtvjw191.png?width=1659&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=bb7c84a5705bb8362f47036c486d855fe3109d08&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/gtfprjtvjw191.png?width=1659&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=bb7c84a5705bb8362f47036c486d855fe3109d08&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;and look, your ShitCoin is now listed and shows a value.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Step Four: Be A Millionaire&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;that&amp;amp;#39;s it&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Your done.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You are now a Millionaire *&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;on paper&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So I created ButtCoinASA and I hold all one billion of them so if you multiply 1,000,000,000 x $0.0019 + 1.9 million dollars!!!!!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;sure I cant cash it out because it only has $3.00 worth of liquidity but it does look like green on that chart to me so I&amp;amp;#39;ll take it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So there you have it boys and girls, you are now the owner of your very own bonafied Shit Coin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What can you do with it? well what ever you&amp;amp;#39;d like to&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;share it with friends&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;give it to strangers&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;start some sort of reward system for your kids&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;if your competent maybe even turn it into an actual project with some real uses and make some money&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;the sky is the limit&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Edit: This is a shitcoin and I&amp;amp;#39;m giving it away by the thousands, please do not provide liquidity I don&amp;amp;#39;t want to be responsible for people losing their money.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

And even made Crypto to their preferred alternative asset currently. That comes just four years after JP Morgan told investors in 2018 that Bitcoin is going to zero and that they should not buy more.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Just another example for the real metric over short term price action. Banks and highly anti-crypto companies changing their opinion about it completly from its &amp;amp;quot;worthless&amp;amp;quot; to &amp;amp;quot;we are buying the dip&amp;amp;quot;. Even in bear markets they are still standing in crypto, Crypto is not just a shortterm profit maker for them they believe in it for real.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I mean if even once anti-crypto people highly believe in Crypto during a bear market even after the current UST crash then Crypto is definitely not going anywhere, we are taking more and more people on our side. That&amp;amp;#39;s the real mass adoption.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some I have been holding for a few years. All the way up, and all the way back down. Hindsight is a bitch, but we all know that, and I&amp;amp;#39;m sure we all learned lessons over this last year about taking profits.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
