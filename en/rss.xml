I am not able to stash some money from my paychecks so I can invest while the market was in a bear market...to be fair, right now I am losing money on a monthly basis. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Luckily I had some emergency funds ready, but that budget is almost gone because of the high gas, heat and food prices in my country. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My portfolio is not looking that good, but I am happy with my picks and I am sure I will get some serious returns on that investment in the longterm. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I don&amp;amp;#39;t want to sell, but if this keeps up, I will have to...and I don&amp;amp;#39;t like that idea at all. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Market experienced a brief dive before recovering to an even higher cap amid EU aggressive new regulations on private wallets.
This shows how bullish the market is as it grows more and more even tho so many bad news (federal interest rate hike and upcoming US crypto regulations) recently hit the market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;ETH briefly reached 3500$ today before retreating to 3480$. Almost every major coin is gaining.
Near gained more than 20%, Graph 14%, Flow and Aave both more than 13% and Terra and Tezos and Arweave and SOL more than 10%!!!
A fantastic day for cryptomarket indeed!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fantom also recovered more than 10% and now is at 1.67$. and people were saying it is dead. A truly remarkable recovery from previous dive to 1$.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Enjoy everyone . You deserve it and more.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: apparently ban is a rather strong and inaccurate definition and I apologize for using it. First of all it is not yet in full effect and needs confirmation from other bodies of European union. And it is more like mandatory KYC for using private wallets.
I thank those who pointed it out.
Cheerz&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When I was young my father left and my whole family became homeless. For the past 5 years I have lived in my car and worked at the lowest paying dead end jobs.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Right now I don&amp;amp;#39;t have a job. You may ask why and the reason is when you are working a dead end job that won&amp;amp;#39;t give you a raise you make more money quitting and taking a few weeks to find a job paying $1 more per hour.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I can make enough to afford an apartment but because the rent price means they require 3X rent as your income... I don&amp;amp;#39;t make enough for that.... So I can&amp;amp;#39;t get an apartment.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I have worked and quit and worked and quit and repeat.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Right now My goal is to save up $30,000 and invest it in Bitcoin. That means if Bitcoin becomes 500K then I&amp;amp;#39;ll have $300,000... And I can retire with that in the Philippines.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I can theoretically save $15000 in a year working while living in my car so I plan on investing ALL of it in Bitcoin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Scientists from the University of Sussex in the UK have built quantum systems with 13 million qubits, which was sufficient enough to break the cryptographic algorithm (SHA-256) that secures the Bitcoin blockchain within the space of 24 hours.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The ability to break the encryption protecting the Bitcoin network allows researchers to catch transactions and reroute coins into their own wallet.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As noted by Mark Webber, lead researcher on the project, advances in quantum computing are inevitably rendering modern encryption redundant, it was a mistake to assume that information encrypted today would remain secure tomorrow.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

This is for good reason, he admits. He sees scammers making millions while he himself earned only a fraction on dogecoin. Dogecoin is consistently in the top 20 of all crypto currencies. The meme-coin was founded as a joke, but gained popularity for many different reasons. In the bull market of 2021, the coin rose from $0.01 to $0.74, an increase of over 7400%.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Marcus didn&amp;amp;#39;t get rich&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In particular, Elon &amp;amp;quot;dogefather&amp;amp;quot; Musk contributed to these increases. With tweets and rumors, he made sure that almost everyone was taken in by the currency. In this kind of action there are always winners and losers. So during this period, many people got rich from DOGE, but people also lost money. Billy Markus never really made himself rich with his creation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/54x0rzltuxq81.png?width=554&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=fcd32e4ccd644830ba88f6cce9ef9a42c2ac8436&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/54x0rzltuxq81.png?width=554&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=fcd32e4ccd644830ba88f6cce9ef9a42c2ac8436&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#39;Of course I&amp;amp;#39;m salty!&amp;amp;#39;&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;People always say I&amp;amp;#39;m salty,&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot; Markus tweeted. &amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Of course I&amp;amp;#39;m salty! I made $3000 from a crypto with a market capitalization of $80 billion. Watching scammers make millions and strangers attack me all day. Who wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t be salty?&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;I&amp;amp;#39;m not saying I&amp;amp;#39;m struggling, I&amp;amp;#39;ve always been fine, except when I sold my crypto in 2015 to pay the rent. I&amp;amp;#39;m just giving context to why so many things are so extra annoying; why it&amp;amp;#39;s annoying that &amp;amp;#39;entitled bastards&amp;amp;#39; 8 years later say I should make them richer.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#39;Create a dogecoin 2&amp;amp;#39;&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So Marcus finds it hard that people hold him accountable for their portfolio, even though he himself had sold his crypto in 2015. A Twitter user shot in an idea to create &amp;amp;#39;dogecoin 2&amp;amp;#39; to make millions, but that is not possible according to Markus.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Yes, for the individual holder there will be solutions, but an industry has been massacred and the EU once more gave up the possibility to take a leading role in cutting edge technology in favour of massive over-regulation.   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The interesting thing is also, as many people in other threats stated that the problem would be old bas**s clinging to power or boomers not understanding crypto/blockchain. Fact is, leading politicians, in this case, were for example Paul Tang (ok he is 54), but also a renowned economist from Spain Ernest Urtasun (40) and even a POC  Assita Kanko (42). The problem here are not old white males at least, the conservative PPE voted against all together but are socialists, social democrats, left-wing liberals and greens... a sad truth but a truth nonetheless&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Please see the table below for detailed results of the final vote for the shady compromise on the law that doomed the crypto industry in the EU:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Would media conglomerates push a &amp;amp;quot;bad for the environment&amp;amp;quot; narrative if it didn&amp;amp;#39;t serve some kind of purpose? These are the same people who continue to refute climate change because the owners profit from oil extraction. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Proof of stake is not a true iteration on proof of work because it removes market externalities from the system. In proof of stake, there are no miners. The rich don&amp;amp;#39;t actually have to spend any money to profit, they just stake it. The person who holds the most coins holds all the power. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In pow, miners have to spend money to buy new equipment and maintain it. Thus, their fortunes are used in the economy, creating a system that sustains itself by forcing those who maintain it to actually spend the asset they&amp;amp;#39;re maintaining. This is not true of proof of stake, which actually encourages people to not use the currency at all. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I hear all kinds of pros for proof of stake, but I&amp;amp;#39;ve never had someone directly refute the argument against it, that it does not have market externalities and thus is not a sustainable economic system. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I would love to hear some comments to that point specifically. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;By debasing Proof of Work, the type of cryptocurrencies that can actually threaten world governments&amp;amp;#39; control over the monetary supply, they push crypto users to the less viable proof of stake chains. It also represents a classic divide and conquer tactic. Creating the division in philosophies between crypto users takes the target off the backs of controlling governments that are only trying to preserve their power in terms of monetary supply and the movement of funds.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: I&amp;amp;#39;m not disputing energy use is bad for the environment. But, driving cars is bad for the environment, watching tv is bad for the environment, washing dishes.. you get the point. Im saying the government and media don&amp;amp;#39;t care about the environment except when it sells a narrative, and I&amp;amp;#39;m saying that I think PoW is worth spending energy on, and I&amp;amp;#39;m saying if there were an alternative that used less energy I&amp;amp;#39;d be all for it, but I don&amp;amp;#39;t think PoS is a viable alternative that achieves what PoW achieves, economically speaking.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Using Gold , they are sidestepping sanctions. Yet I cannot find any chatter of how gold is being used to side step sanctions, by the usual talking heads like Elizabeth Warren who tried to make a case that crypto could be used by Russia. She even brought out some Act in Congress agains this.. but Russia is actually using gold, and she is silent as a mouse on this issue. Does she love her gold jewellery so much that she cannot bear to see it being linked with the enemy using it for nefarious purposes?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They just want to make a worst case scenario for everything related with crypto, and are willing to disregard what is actually happening. Where is the &amp;amp;quot;Protect Gold From Enemies&amp;amp;quot; Act ?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Russia has not used crypto whatsoever, yet hundreds of articles and forums were keenly discussing just the possibility. In many places you couldn&amp;amp;#39;t reason with the mob that Russia cant use crypto given they cannot even access liquid exchanges that are all based out of the West. No one cared, everyone used it as an occasion to smear crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now that Russia&amp;amp;#39;s government is using gold, all of these people are silent. It is fine to use gold ,but if they use crypto then they will raise their voices? The levels of hypocrisy are off the charts.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On the POW ban, that failed to pass by a small margin. On today&amp;amp;#39;s vote regarding the crack down on unhosted wallets and privacy, it passed by a thin margin because we didn&amp;amp;#39;t take action like last time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Please read the related threads (like Patrick Hansen, Unstoppable Finance, Coinbase, etc. on Twitter), there&amp;amp;#39;s still time to make a difference in subsequent steps before the law is finalized and enacted.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We need to come together in these crucial votes to tip the balance towards privacy, independence, liberty, justice, freedom. If we do nothing, tyranny and centralization of power will keep growing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

It&amp;amp;#39;s the same with Bluetooth or most of technology itself. Consumers  stop caring or trying to figure out how most things work once it starts working for then or provide utility.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto has hopes of solving many problems but people aren&amp;amp;#39;t able to wrap their minds around it (Nfts made it even harder). On top of that most of crypto is hard. Part of the reason most people are still using exchanges to store crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Of course none of it would matter if it is possible for it to be conveniently part of peoples life and is solving problems.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We should stop explaining how things work to the average Joe and force him to into investing instead we need utility for the world to see.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Seeing coins like SHIB, DOGE in the past has only encouraged these people in their thinking that they can make a lot of money off of these coins, when the reality is that those 2 were only 2 among thousands of coins that got lucky. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Investing should be done with a purpose, otherwise it becomes pure gambling and you&amp;amp;#39;ll likely fail. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That purpose could be Bitcoin as a means of decentralization, as a means of inflation hedge, or just as a currency that&amp;amp;#39;s easy to transfer. As long as you know what you support in your coin, you have a purpose in it that you believe. Which is what investing is, not closing your eyes and picking a coin. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Not only you won&amp;amp;#39;t be rich, but you&amp;amp;#39;ll also lose your money in these coins. Only people getting rich will be those controlling the coin with their bags that are ready to sell. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But of course, there still are those projects with purpose and that can change the market, but you&amp;amp;#39;ll need a lot of time on your hands to find those new ones.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There are many examples but the process of ordering an Uber/Lyft is one where the concept is very simple and understandable (hailing a cab) but may be difficult to explain to someone 30 years ago as so much technology has built on top of itself to allow it. (High speed internet, smart phones, apps, GPS, etc.)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What simple task today will be done in a completely new fashion in 2-3 decades as the technology infrastructure of crypto/blockchain continues to be built out?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They never want to target cases or companies that are difficult, challenging, or embarrassing. They’re an agency that polices broken windows on the street level and rarely goes to the penthouse floors!         &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They contact blockchain businesses that are holding token sales and force them to close and refund investors. They claim to “maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation” but play nice to big corporations, while employees take very high paying private sector jobs after working there!            &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They shells out billions and billions of fines each year but a large number of those fines go to big banks, some of the most evil companies on earth!!        &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Their enforcement division is measured by only two metrics, the number of cases filed and the monetary penalties - more than half of SEC employees are made up of enforcement personnel and examination staff - they need serious reallocation of their resources! Enough is enough!! Gary you might have taught that MIT class but you have no business &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;‘regulating’&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; the future of global finance!        &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TLDR; &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The SEC is a useless government body that does NOTHING to actually protect investors&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, only favors big business, and should stay the HELL away from cryptocurrencies.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

These blockchain-based monetizations of the gaming experience are effectively play-to-earn crypto games. Players play to gain prizes rather than to win, which is what sets them apart from typical games. The ability to compensate players for their time and effort is, unsurprisingly, at the root of the quick rise in popularity of these play-to-earn games, often known as GameFi.

The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency has seen a spike in interest this year ahead of a widely anticipated shift to a proof-of-stake (PoS) model. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;ETH price has surged over 20% in the past two weeks, and was trading at around $3,400- close to breaking even for the year. Daily volumes have also steadily risen, averaging at roughly $20 billion over the past week.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;BTC price also shot up to 2022 highs this week, and was trading around $47,000. But while volumes did increase, they were substantially lower than the massive amounts of liquidity seen in 2021. Still, the world’s largest cryptocurrency commanded over 40% of total crypto market capitalization.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But the latest crypto rally has also seen several altcoins vastly outperform BTC, while notching record highs in market capitalization. A similar scenario was observed during the start of the 2021 rally, which had eventually challenged BTC’s dominance.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And so the question is will &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://getblock.io/nodes/eth/?utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;amp;utm_campaign=promo&quot;&amp;gt;ETH&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; lead the next Bull Run?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you’re interested in going anywhere, it’ll cost you about 40% more than this time last year just to fill up your gas tank. And that’s only the tip of the iceberg…&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
