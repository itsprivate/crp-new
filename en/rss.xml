The reason is most centralised exchanges don’t allow you to withdraw XMR under fake technical reasons. Meanwhile, XMR deposits are always welcome and available.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Later, users of other cryptos recognised they can’t withdraw their funds due to fake power of liquidity. Although anonymous cryptos are affected first, some time other types of crypto were touched.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This insane situation is made possible because large centralised exchanges trend to have fake liquidity at all. That’s because their economical nature is to generate profit dependent on your buy/sell operations: no buy/sell leads to no profit. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And because crypto exchanges are not properly regulated as traditional asset exchanges, they practice to simply generate inexistent “paper” coins. You can easily trade these coins but if you try to withdraw them, you fail.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Most corrupt exchanges in that sense of “paper” coins are Binance, Huobi and Poloniex. Please don’t use that exchanges at all in the future and prepare to migrate from them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On April 18 2022, just try to withdraw all your crypto from all centralised exchanges and hence check whether exchanges of your choice do trade “paper” coins or not. If so, you can’t withdraw. Blacklist that exchanges and broadcast them to all your friends in all social media.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is extremely easy experiment, just perform your own test!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you ask where to migrate from Binance, Huobi and Poloniex, consider the following list:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://kycnot.me&quot;&amp;gt;https://kycnot.me&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Upd. XMR/BTC &amp;amp;gt; 0.006, as Monero community is the most active in April 18 event.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Upd. UTC 15:18 XMR 0.0065 @ $256. Make your XMR withdrawals from centralised exchanges on a per week basis! It works!!!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;hr/&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzbBi0agLNg&quot;&amp;gt;I UNCOVERED A BILLION DOLLAR FRAUD&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;hr/&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To summarise the actions of John Karony, the CEO:  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Enacted the 100% tax honeypot, covered by myself &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/tuumsi/safemoons_v1_100_tax_results_in_the_theft_of/&quot;&amp;gt;here&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, but the major story &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;as &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;though&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;tens&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;of&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;millions&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;of&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;dollars&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;stolen&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;isn&amp;amp;#39;t&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;a&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;big&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;story&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; is that he had a deal with the Crypto Exchange Bitmart, who ran their own version of Safemoon&amp;amp;#39;s &amp;amp;quot;tokenomics&amp;amp;quot; (10% buy and sell tax) - so what they would do is redistribute 5% to holders themselves, and then send 5% of transactions to Karony which Karony was supposed to add to the liquidity pool.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;Except he did not&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He appears to have kept it.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;hr/&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So what this means is that all the people that have gone blue in the face telling us that John was cleaning house, getting rid of all the bad apples.. well he was just as crooked as the rest of them. Truly a den of thieves.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Birds of a feather flock together&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What&amp;amp;#39;s mad is laying it all out...  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Kyle&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; who copy-pasted the contract kept withdrawing from the Liquidity Pool even while claiming you couldn&amp;amp;#39;t and that Safemoon was &amp;amp;quot;rugpull resistant&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Thomas&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; who lied about his Ripple job offer, lied about his development credentials and continually siphoned funds from the liquidity pool into his own wallet&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;John&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; who constantly claims Safemoon is the evolution, sets up dodgy deals with Bitmart and creates the V1-&amp;amp;gt;V2 honeypot&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It just goes on and on. Every week a new stone is unturned and people find more and more filth and scum.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But it just slides off the back of the criminally-deluded Safemoon Army. Today has seen three wallets sell $500,000 between them, and we&amp;amp;#39;re only a few hours after the wallet released. The whales are not happy about this, but the casual holders?  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here are some quotes from their sub...  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Buy the DIP, Safemoon to the moon, if you sell you, then you is a low life. LOL Dimond hands baby. We will be rich in 5 years. People fud bitcoin and look where we at 10 years later. Buy the Dip and you will be rich in 5+ years.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;1 billion volume is coming...We will be on all major exchanges soon. Love these tasty dips.   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Just watched, it&amp;amp;#39;s bad on so many levels. But he&amp;amp;#39;s at least good at editing. He makes a lot of arguments but fail to provide any proof.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;MY DUDE HE LITERALLY GAVE YOU THE BLOCKCHAIN TRANSACTION HASHES IN THE VIDEO MY DUUUUUUUUDE.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Video is pure conjecture and open-ended opinions that leads the watcher (by the nose) to form an opinion off of nothing; but it sounds good.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He&amp;amp;#39;s just after clicks and is trying to profit from spreading fud about safemoon for his own financial gain and popularity, nothing more  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I made my mind last year. I have a goal to achieve and every new wave of fud and dip that comes after is only a great way for me to buy more.   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is the biggest heads-in-sand moment I&amp;amp;#39;ve ever witnessed. When will they wake up? When John is in jail? When Safemoon is 0.00000000000000001? Or is that just another great buying OP? Fuck a rubber duck.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I’m in the same spot.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here’s my situation&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Used a bot for a long time, tax/gains to report. Have to report cost basis on tokens that are too cheap. Have 500k+ transactions, max size csv exports &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Lots of tokens for a period were small decimal project for ex: 0.00000001. Softwares can’t keep up or report on these size transactions. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Can’t import or Exports csv &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Nothing seems to be able to do it right, platforms can’t keep up.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I’m not able to import all required transactions. Definitely some terrible stuff going on this year. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Basically get audit protection. We’re screwed. Report your final numbers and pray.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;——-&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: Thank you &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/u/ChiTownBob&quot;&amp;gt;/u/ChiTownBob&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; for the sound solid advice below. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;TLDR - Import the max CSV sizes, don’t use coin tracker if you’re in this similar situation, Report end capital gains and losses, audit protection. Form 8949 as mentioned in the comments let’s you summarize, steps in comments.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But when TED CRUZ basically says the same thing, the crypto community says he has an ulterior motive, or they worry aloud about how this transformative technology (whose original mission statement was to separate money from State) is, heaven forbid, becoming political.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If this community is this irritated by little ol&amp;amp;#39; Ted Cruz, then I&amp;amp;#39;m afraid our sense of cohesion is in for a real bumpy ride ahead...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;[edit: As a rule, given any two parties with opinions regarding wealth redistribution, one should always expect the one who is least supportive to be the first to embrace a confiscation resistant technology like Bitcoin. So, in America, you should expect the Libertarians to support it first, followed by the Right, and eventually parts of the Left.]&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Horrendous fees to do literally anything with crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Still so complicated to deal with and risks of accidentally losing your money.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hodling, diamond hands, rockets etc.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“Unregulated” - ok, if that’s even really true, is that so great? See above re scams.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Using fiat remains by far easier and more secure. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And last but not least, just losing money unless you’re lucky to have been ACTUALLY early (you are no longer early) or strike on a pump and dump early and get out at the right time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cruz had words for everyone from Justin Trudeau and Elizabeth Warren to even the Chinese Communist Party for opposing Bitcoin because of a desire to control the financial freedom and civil liberties of people.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;One of the reasons im Bullish on Bitcoin and on crypto is because it is decentralized and not controllable&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He then proceeded to read the now infamous letter from the Nunchuk bitcoin wallet company to the Canadian Government that said they are unable to freeze accounts because that is how decentralization works.  &amp;amp;quot;When the Canadian dollar becomes worthless, we will be here to serve you, too&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://mobile.twitter.com/tedcruz/status/1497031845984227328&quot;&amp;gt;https://mobile.twitter.com/tedcruz/status/1497031845984227328&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While politicians will always use any tool to get back at the opposition, it is important to remember that Bitcoin isnt Anti or Pro anyone. Lets try to not get swept off by partisan politics.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yes I said economic collapse, I know some of you might think I&amp;amp;#39;m crazy for believing that the world&amp;amp;#39;s trusted governments are steering us in the wrong direction but I believe it&amp;amp;#39;s true.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Take Bitcoin for example, this thing could really take off. I know it&amp;amp;#39;s not very well regarded now and many believe it&amp;amp;#39;s only for illegal activities but if you look beyond that it could have real uses as a hedge against inflation.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There is also another newer crypto called Ethereum, this could possibly change the way the world works.   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Look into these if you get a Chance, I know it sounds crazy but this magic internet money is the future.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I run a motorcycle workshop dealing with usually fairly large job such as race bike conversions, crash damage etc and I recently took the jump to accepting BTC payments. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I launched this on my website along with the Facebook and Twitter pages. I also have added it to my invoices and even mention it as a payment mention to anyway who asks over the phone/in person. I have a 10% discount for any invoice paid in Bitcoin for the first 10 customers. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It’s been 6 months now and every time without fail it is “I’ll pay by card please”. Not one person has shown any interest in Bitcoin or cryptocurrency in general. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It’s strange because in the circles I’m in (including this sub), crypto is a part of every day life and it’s easy to think this carries over to the general public.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For now at least I think we are still so far away from mainstream adoption. Especially with my usual customer stereotype - 40’s and somewhat successful. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I’ll keep trying and see how it goes. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Maybe I need to start accepting doge and get to work fixing scooters instead!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

In it, OP claims that he &amp;amp;quot;accumulated his wealth&amp;amp;quot; by combing through the vast sea of microcap shitcoins on CoinGecko and picking winners.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Don&amp;amp;#39;t listen to him.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;First, even if a project meets all 7 of his criteria, there&amp;amp;#39;s still not a &amp;amp;quot;good chance&amp;amp;quot; that it will become valuable. There are tons of well-intentioned projects that go absolutely nowhere. And if we have anything like the bear market of 2018, then it&amp;amp;#39;s probably going to zero.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Second, OP is lying about his success. Just 16 days ago, he made &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.unddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ttnetb/whats_going_on_with_move2earn_coins_how_do_you/&quot;&amp;gt;this post&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; asking how to find tokens before they pump:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I try to get in early, but it&amp;amp;#39;s so hard to find these gems. Anyone have a technique? I&amp;amp;#39;m baffled that people are making 100x on a regular basis. Here I&amp;amp;#39;m crying in my 5% gain per year coins :(&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Maybe one day I&amp;amp;#39;ll get lucky too, but so far I&amp;amp;#39;ve been hitting flat liners. One thing I heard is that people look into rank 1000-5000 market cap coins. But those seem so risky. What red flags are people looking at, and what are signs of healthy projects? I think doxxed teams are probably a good sign these days after all the scams. Anything else?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/YQtVQoI.jpg&quot;&amp;gt;Screenshot from Google cache&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So we&amp;amp;#39;re to believe that by some magic, he went from having zero success to amassing wealth through shitcoins, all over the course of 16 days. Incredible.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Stop upvoting this hopium, guys. Don&amp;amp;#39;t invest into microcaps expecting to make any serious returns, especially with the market the way it is right now.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Let me just start of that his story is anecdotal and not based on any evidence, but let’s just give it the benefit of the doubt.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;——&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Being early is everything in crypto&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That’s not entirely true. Of course everyone wants a time machine so they can buy Bitcoin back in 2009/2010/2011, but what’s the point if being early if you would not have held until 2021/2022? Remember pizza guy?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A lot of people who were early sold early too. When Bitcoin was $1k or even $100 for example. But I don’t blame them, because profit = profit. Anyway, being early is good but &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;certainly&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; not “everything”.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;so it baffles me that people buy top 50 coins and expect to get rich. These generally have 2-3x potential at best in any reasonable investor timeframe, while lowcaps have 100-500x potential.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Incorrect. If FTM (#46 on Coingecko) had the marketcap of DOGE (#12 on Coingecko), the upside would be 544%. Even if ATOM (#23 on Coingecko) had the marketcap of ADA (#8 on Coingecko), the upside would be 330%. And let’s not forget that the crypto market is relatively new: Bitcoin exists for only 13 years. Cryptocurrency in general has a lot of grow potential.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also, OP has a narrow definition of “reasonable investor timeframe”. What does that even mean? People expecting quick gains, chasing pumps or waiting for their coin to x100 often get burned. Besides, lowcaps may have 100-500x potential, but are very volatile and even though the price may go up fast… it can dump real fast too. High/mid marketcaps are a more stable and safer choice.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;But it&amp;amp;#39;s so risky!&amp;amp;quot; you may object. Well, here&amp;amp;#39;s the thing: that risk can be managed by looking at some key factors before you invest in a project:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;OP then continues by writing down some rules. These are good guidelines to pick a solid project with a good use case, and avoid things like a pump and dump.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If your inquiry survived all 7 points, congratulations! You&amp;amp;#39;re &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;early&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; in a project that has a good chance of becoming very valuable.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Exactly. “A good chance.” We only hear of success stories and generally don’t hear about the times people who failed to pick a project that did a x100.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To finish this rant, I would like to get rid of the assumption that a good project or a doxxed team does not automatically mean that the price is going to x100. There are a LOT of very good and solid (low marketcap) projects that never got in the top marketcap rankings for years.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Summary&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I have been following this developing story on Twitter about a user that lost $650K yesterday due to the following phishing method with others coming forward claiming that the same has also happened to them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Background&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When you create a wallet using MetaMask on an iPhone, the app will create a JSON containing your wallet, this is stored on your device.  Most users use iCloud to automatically backup their phone and app data, but unbeknown to many users, MetaMask include this file as part of the backup.  From a google search, this isn&amp;amp;#39;t new, it was discovered in 2019, but MetaMask have today acknowledged (addressed) it &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://nitter.net/MetaMask&quot;&amp;gt;HERE&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; after a number of users were targeted resulting in lost funds.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/zwx26nnww4u81.png?width=744&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=46e5360122bdbed0ef700bee43cab95cbfc5ec25&quot;&amp;gt;MetaMask iCloud Backup&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Phishing Method&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For the user that lost $650K, it appears to be a very sophisticated attack. They fell victim as follows...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The malicious attacker requested several password resets against their AppleID/iCloud generating several emails to their account.  From there, they using a spoofed caller id to call the victim and claimed that they were from Apple and calling about suspicious activity on their account.  They asked them to generate their MFA one time pass to confirm that they were the account owner.   The hacker used this to reset the password and take control of the Apple account.  From there, they were able to restore from a backup and drain the wallet of all funds. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And people calling this price range as a bear market makes me fucking bullish. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;True bear market would be below $10k, you guys need to go back in time and see what is actually rational. 40k is still extremely bullish. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So, stop being a negative Nancy and try to appreciate dips and corrections. If you truly believe in BTC, you&amp;amp;#39;d be stacking out of your minds. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

These generally have 2-3x potential at best in any reasonable investor timeframe, while lowcaps have 100-500x potential. Of course you buy lowcaps.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;But it&amp;amp;#39;s so risky!&amp;amp;quot; you may object. Well, here&amp;amp;#39;s the thing: that risk can be managed by looking at some key factors before you invest in a project:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Is the team doxed? If yes, continue&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Is the initial distribution reasonable and transparent? If yes, continue&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Does the project belong to a category with one valuable project at the top and several smaller ones? If yes, continue. The move2earn category is a good example. stepn is at the top (don&amp;amp;#39;t invest in that) with several interesting lowcaps (invest in the unique ones)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Does the project have differentiating attributes? If yes, continue. If it&amp;amp;#39;s just a fork, stop now.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Does the project have an active non-price-chat community on Telegram and other socials? If yes, continue&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Is the project solving hard problems? If yes, continue&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Is the &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;fully diluted&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; market cap below $15M? If yes, continue&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If your inquiry survived all 7 points, congratulations! You&amp;amp;#39;re &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;early&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; in a project that has a good chance of becoming very valuable.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Reasonably unique lowcap projects tend to do 20-200x. Make sure you formulate an exit plan and stick to it. Not taking profit keeps you poor.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Lowcaps are risky, yes, but risk can be managed. I made my wealth by putting a decent chunk of money into a handful of projects fitting the 7 bullet points, and I recommend everyone giving it a shot.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Good luck!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

But this past conference, it just really felt weak and ineffective.  Many of the guests really just wanted to talk about their company, or their book, or whatever project they were working on, and just kind of rambled on it.  Far too much talk about crypto in general, and not really much about Bitcoin itself.  Not a lot of macroeconomic analysis and commentary.  Even the star-studded panel with Serena Williams/Aaron Rodgers/Odell Beckham Jr. was pretty cringey and awkward for a lot of it.  Cynthia Lummis was really ramble-bamble-ish.  Even the panel with Adam Back got stuck in the weeds with no roadmap out.  And to top it all off, the Bull was missing his Balls.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Last year, the 2021 conference had the WTF Happened in 1971 guys, Lawrence Lepard and a bunch of just really good, articulate presentations about economics and Bitcoin itself.  This year it really kind of ran off track, IMO.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is a visual orderbook and shows where resting (limit) orders are, the brighter the white the higher value the order is, the more blue to colour the lower the blue.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
As most of you will know most of the &amp;amp;#39;whales&amp;amp;#39; trade on bitfinex, and this specific pictures I&amp;amp;#39;ve sent are from the bitfinex orderbooks. The same whale who purchased over 1600 coins from the prices between 37.5k down to 34.5 has taken profit from 45k-48k and has now successfully rebought between 43.8k-40k. This type of orders are referred to as &amp;amp;#39;Iceberg orders&amp;amp;#39;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While this does not mean that the market is going to pump immediately because 1 big player is buying, I am just sharing this information as I know a lot of people on this sub always go on about &amp;amp;#39;whale manipulation&amp;amp;#39; so instead of speculating about what whales do using TA, here you can see what they&amp;amp;#39;re actually doing.   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

It&amp;amp;#39;s pretty annoying when you&amp;amp;#39;re trying to move a small amount of crypto and/or anything Ethereum-based from one exchange to another (CEX or DEX) and you&amp;amp;#39;re prompted to pay a fee that feels just ridiculous. 
My first suggestion to anyone trying to minimize the fees would be to check out the withdrawal/network fees for XLM (Stellar Lumens) on their exchange. 
While every exchange will be a bit different, here&amp;amp;#39;s how much it would cost for me to withdraw the Top 15 coins (incl. stablecoins, except for BUSD) from a CEX (KuCoin) right now:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;BTC: 0.0005 BTC (~$20.25)
ETH: 0.00625 ETH (~$18.98)
USDT: 35 USDT ($35)
BNB: 0.01 BNB (~$4.17)
USDC: 15 USDC ($15)
XRP: 0.25 XRP (~$0.20)
SOL: 0.01 SOL (~$1.01)
ADA: 1 ADA (~$0.95)
LUNA: 0.05 LUNA (~$4.02)
AVAX: 0.01 AVAX (~$0.77)
DOGE: 20 DOGE (~$2.94)
DOT: 0.1 DOT (~$1.83)
UST: 2 UST ($2)
SHIB: 1,100,000 SHIB (~$28.42)
WBTC: 0.0007 WBTC (~$28.35)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;XRP is the cheapest here at a pretty modest $0.20 withdrawl fee. Not too shabby.
Now, as someone who is also a fan of NANO, I had to check that one too:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;XNO (NANO): 0.02 XNO (~$0.04)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Okay, 4 pennies is pretty damn cheap so what&amp;amp;#39;s the big deal? Why XLM? Well...:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;XLM: 0.02 XLM (~$0.0041)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It costs &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;less than half of a single penny&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; to withdraw my XLM from KuCoin. To compare, I&amp;amp;#39;d pay over &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;10 times more money&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; to withdraw NANO instead. On top of that, XLM is a tradable currency at a &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;lot&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; more exchanges than NANO.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I tested this out by sending 10.5 XLM (~$2.10) from Coinbase Pro to Binance.US to KuCoin, then BACK to Coinbase Pro. All 3 CEX withdrawls cost me a grand total of 0.03 XLM (~$0.006), leaving me with 10.47 XLM (~$2.094). Still not even a &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;single penny&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; in fees.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Of course, trading fees exist and vary from exchange to exchange. Some have free currency conversion, some don&amp;amp;#39;t. So swapping from your preferred currency to XLM and back might cost a small amount of money, but it will still &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;very likely&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; be cheaper than withdrawing the original currency itself.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If any of you have a strategy like this that you use, or one that&amp;amp;#39;s even better, I&amp;amp;#39;d love to hear it! 
And of course, be sure to do your own research before trying this.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

We have clearly been on a continuous downtrend for the past 6 months which has been a little depressing and bitcoin is over 30% down from this point 1 year ago. What can get us out of this? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Could it be the Russia invasion of Ukraine coming to an end? XRP winning the court case against SEC? Bitcoin being declared as part of a big company&amp;amp;#39;s balance sheet? Or could we have to wait as long as the next bitcoin halving in 2024?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Personally I think the war plus inflation is probably the biggest thing holding us back right now!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
