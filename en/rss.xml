This alone accounts for a huge % of borrowing on Solana, and now this position is under a liquidation threat. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The whale is not closing their position. In most protocols like Compound, or AAVE, Maker etc, this will result in an onchain liquidation. Infact we have seen many such large liquidations on AAVE And Maker recently, and everything has worked as expected. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However such a large liquidation in an illiquid market and unstable network like Solana is likely to have vastly damaging consequences. Solana network has already gone down and halted half a dozen time. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Solend team explains what could happen to the network:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This  could cause chaos, putting a strain on the Solana network. Liquidators  would be especially active and spamming the liquidate function, which  has been known to be a factor causing Solana to go down in the past.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Letting a liquidation of this size to happen on-chain is extremely risky.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;  DEX liquidity isn’t deep enough to handle a sale of this size and could  cause cascading effects. Additionally, liquidators will be incentivized  to spam the network in an effort to win very lucrative liquidations.  This has been known to cause load issues for Solana in the past which  would exacerbate the problems at hand.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So to prevent this, they are proposing to literally steal the user&amp;amp;#39;s funds and execute OTC trades:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Grant  emergency power to Solend Labs to temporarily take over the whale’s  account so the liquidation can be executed OTC and avoid pushing Solana  to its limits. This would be done via a smart contract upgrade.  Emergency powers will be revoked once the whale’s account reaches a safe  level.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When shit starts to implode, all the true colors of decentralization comes out. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These shitty protocol are run by fly by night cowboys who learnt basics of economics during the bull run. They put their users are risk by running terrible protocols that do not think about all the edge cases...because who cares about risks right?! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And during signs of distress, they resolve to seize user funds.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Everyone has essentially written it off as something between gambling and a scam, with phrases like “greater fools” echoing from thread to thread. There isn’t even a hint of rhetoric resembling open discourse about the crypto space in the comments.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I’m wondering how we arrived at such a divisive place, if we should be worried that the rhetoric is becoming overwhelmingly negative and polarized, and if Reddit is analogous main stream sentiment. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Part of what gives anything value is the belief that it has value. As amazing as the theory and tech side of crypto is, with its potential to revolutionize and disrupt archaic systems, if people simply emotionally decide it’s worthless, then it could become a self fulfilling prophecy of sorts.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Curious what this community thinks about this.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Fair enough, that&amp;amp;#39;s usually the case.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But combined with this relative &amp;amp;quot;calm&amp;amp;quot; amongst people in the crypto sphere as of yet, what we&amp;amp;#39;re also seeing is altcoins holding the line in an unprecedented way. I thought it was just a few coins like LINK and ADA who were doing well. But I was just made aware of the fact that out of the top 100 on CMC, only 10 and 5 coins have &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;worse&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; performing 7-day metrics than BTC and ETH respectively. Yes, you read that right. In this gigantic downturn, when BTC just broke it&amp;amp;#39;s previous ATH which has never happened before, a time when there should be absolute doubt and panic, only 10 (!!!) coins have a worse 7-day performance than btc. This is unprecedented.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What I&amp;amp;#39;m also reading a lot of, and a good point someone else made whose name I forgot, is that BTC and ETH are crashing because that&amp;amp;#39;s where all the liquidations happen.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I don&amp;amp;#39;t know about you, but BTC could drop another 70%, and so could all my alts, but the time for selling has been long gone, and in fact, even if BTC dropped another 70%, I would be buying. Not BTC, but more alts. Because the ones I have, I have no doubt about their future, so why wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t I? Fucking bargain! It&amp;amp;#39;s kinda funny because earlier I actually caught myself being irritated at LINK because it wasn&amp;amp;#39;t dropping as hard as BTC, preventing me to scoop them up cheaper.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My point is, this crash doesn&amp;amp;#39;t seem to be caused by doubtful panic like all the times before. We know what we have. And we&amp;amp;#39;re not going to part with it. And given all this I just don&amp;amp;#39;t feel that the thesis, that we need this whole sub to panic in order to find a bottom, to hold this time around. I&amp;amp;#39;ve been here  since 2013 (I know, anecdotal), but something feels different. I don&amp;amp;#39;t see myself suddenly start panicking if btc drops another 50%, you? The doubt and fear that we had all previous crashes is pretty much gone. This is just shitty liquidations happening, and who knows when they might stop.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now of course, naysayers might say that this very post is proof of the fact that we&amp;amp;#39;re not near a bottom yet. Fair enough. But that doesn&amp;amp;#39;t change the very different situation we seem to find ourselves in as described above this time around.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I’ve not invested a sum that I cannot afford to lose and it’s not like my livelihood will come under risk because of this crash.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But I do feel scared being in my first crypto bear market. I do not plan on selling and have moved my coins from exchanges. Yet I feel scared. For the first time seeing those price drops literally scares me.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I’m not planning on getting out but I’ve learned some hard lessons like take profits on your alts and don’t get greedy. And also never be married to a position.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Previous bear market survivors did you feel the same during your first bear market?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also other people in a similar position to me keep strong.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Fewer people are buying the dip on this sub.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Fewer people are imploring others to just hodl.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Fewer people are making hyper passionate posts / replies about the technology and how much they dislike banks.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Therefore, after selling ALL of the BTC I bought for around $7k in 2020 for $39k in 2021, I have started to buy again.  I&amp;amp;#39;ve been waiting for fewer &amp;amp;quot;buy the dip&amp;amp;quot; &amp;amp;quot;hodl&amp;amp;quot; and I ❤️ BTC posts.  This signifies to me that folks are very afraid.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m feeling very greedy.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But... I&amp;amp;#39;m also being cautious.  It is quite possible for BTC to move down to around $10k again.  For instance, if this drawback parallels the high of previous bull markets, $12k is in sight.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However, I cannot time a bottom.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;No one can pick a bottom.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I can only smell fear.  I buy when I smell fear. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However, part of me feels like people are not afraid enough.... There are LESS posts about buying at these prices here on this sub... I do believe we will eventually get to a point where there will be none.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Until then, I&amp;amp;#39;ll keep NIBBLING.  Little chunks (5% of my total BTC bankroll at a time).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I am a big fan of taking profits and regularly skimming the cream from the top of my portfolio.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Let&amp;amp;#39;s do a little thought experiment. Suppose you were a super unlucky bastard and bought 1 BTC at $20,000 back in the 2017/2018 cycle. BTC goes parabolic during a pandemic and hits $67,000. What&amp;amp;#39;s so bad with selling 10% for example? or 20% of your entire stack?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I bet some people will say &amp;amp;#39;but it&amp;amp;#39;s impossible to time the market and to hit the exact top&amp;amp;#39;. OK sure, it&amp;amp;#39;s very difficult. But BTC was over $50,000 from the 5th of October 2021 to the 10th of December 2021. That&amp;amp;#39;s two months to make that decision. Two months is a looong time. And it was above 60k for over a month. If someone sold 10% of their 1 BTC during that time (without hitting the exact top at all) they&amp;amp;#39;d still have 0.9 BTC remaining in their wallet and around $5000-6000 dollars in their pocket. You just put that into a stablecoin and keep it for later. Patience is a virtue. And timing the market is not that very hard really. The moment everyone in your family, at work, on the news and every celebrity is talking about it. When people talk about crypto during Saturday Night Live you know this is the time to get the hell out of the crypto space. When your grandma asks you about the magic internet money that&amp;amp;#39;s your signal to get the hell out. ASAP.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now comes June 2022. BTC is under $20k again. You can use that $5000 and buy another 0.25 BTC for practically free. Now you have 1.15 BTC for the next cycle and you can keep it to retire or whatever. Assuming that you&amp;amp;#39;ve never DCA&amp;amp;#39;d in the last 4-5 years you still have 1.15 BTC in your pocket. Now you can sell 0.15 BTC during the next cycle to skim profits again when BTC hits $100,000 for example. And you&amp;amp;#39;ll still have your initial 1 BTC safe in your wallet for your retirement. Now you can put down a deposit for your first house with that $25,000. Or buy a car, or go for a nice long holiday. Whatever. Anything you want.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But be aware that taking profits does feel bad sometimes, especially when prices continue to go up. And I know this from my personal experience, I felt really bad when I sold my ETH at $1400, $1700, and again at $2500 marks. Because it went over $4000 later. But you know what? I&amp;amp;#39;ve still made over 450% in profits. And now ETH dropped below $1k. I can either keep my 450% profit in stablecoins or I can buy 4.5 more ETH than I had before from my 450% profit that I&amp;amp;#39;ve skimmed. Now, it doesn&amp;amp;#39;t feel so bad anymore. I hope you get my point. Sure it would be nice to sell at $4k and make 900% or 1400% profit but like I said it&amp;amp;#39;s very hard to predict the market and hit the exact top. So why not just chill and skim some profits from time to time?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TAKE PROFIT NEXT TIME PEOPLE it&amp;amp;#39;s not that hard.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I don’t think crypto will go up a reasonable amount while the stock market is losing value. We could very well be on our way to $10k here in the next month or two. Ethereum at $500 is a very reasonable price target abs Bitcoin at $10,000.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Don’t invest in alt coins. You’ll be able to get them at pennies on the dollar. This summer will not be kind to crypto. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I hope I’m wrong and this post will make crypto change course but I doubt it. This is the time when real money is made. Time to average down and lower your cost basis greatly. Be safe out there people!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When crypto is declared dead and nobody argues, that&amp;amp;#39;s a good time to buy.  Sounds crazy but that&amp;amp;#39;s what capitulation is.  Wait until you have resigned yourself to looking at your stupid boss&amp;amp;#39;s face for the rest of your life.  Wait until you haven&amp;amp;#39;t checked this sub or charts for months.  Wait until your friends brag about the 3% returns they&amp;amp;#39;re getting from their savings accounts at the bank.  That&amp;amp;#39;s what a bottom looks like.  That&amp;amp;#39;s when you pick yourself up and start rebuilding.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

So why even spend the whole day looking at the charts?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I know that now it’s the perfect time for accumulating, but you can keep with your weekly/monthly DCA without spending your whole day at crypto charts. Mental Health is vital, and especially when you’re losing huge amounts of money. Everybody will be talking now about Bitcoin falling below the previous market cycle top, but you will thank yourself later if you take a break from social media and crypto charts.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TLDR: Go out with your family/friends and enjoy this summer, I promise when you come back crypto won’t be gone. Focus on your mental health in these hard times and keep doing your DCA in BTC/ETH.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitcoin mining profitability has plummeted by more than 75% from the market peak. It is now at its lowest level since October 2020, and any sell-off from here might drive it back into 2017 territory.

I understand that you can use a cold storage to protect your crypto, just as you can use paper cash to protect your cash. But at some point you will need to make a transfer and use an exchange or a bank and your crypto or money can be locked out. What is the difference then?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;2 - People say that CBDCs will give more power to governemnts. In most countries if you get your social security or similar blocked by the governemnt you can&amp;amp;#39;t do anything in the financial system, so I believe governments already have all the power they need to block your financial life. And I would rather put my money on a CBDC than on a project such as Terraluna or similar. What&amp;amp;#39;s the advantage of crypto or stablecoins here?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;3 - Transactions fees are enourmous for Bitcoin and Etherium, sometimes even more expensive than using a traditional bank. Fintechs can offer international transfers, regardless of the amount being transferred for a flat fee. What&amp;amp;#39;s the advantage of crypto in this regard?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;4 - Store of value. Nothing with the extreme volatily of Bitcoin, Etherium, etc can be considered a good store of value. A store of value implies low volatility and an asset that at least keep up with inflation. I often see people comparing the rise of Bitcoin price vs the loss of value of the US dollar and other currencies. This is a fallacy. Bitcoin gained value since its invention but it doesn&amp;amp;#39;t mean that if you bought it a month ago as a store of value it did its job. Crypto in general are looking more like shares than a store of value. It goes up and it goes down, to make money you either time it right or hold it for decades. What am I missing here?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;5 - Exchanges get hacked or go bust and there is no one to turn to to have your crypto back. With banks the government guarantees up to a certain amount of your cash if the bank goes under.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;hr/&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m very sincere with my questions and I really would like to hear good and adult counter arguments.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

BTC around $50k for a chunk of the year. ETH at $4k. The prices were already too high. To get a 4x we needed $200k and $16k. Just insane levels to expect. Other coins like Solana and Cardano were in the same boat.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now a 4x seems much more reasonable. ETH bouncing from $1k back to $4k. BTC getting back to where it was. This could take some time or it might never happen. Still, as the dust settles this sure looks like a buying opportunity with a realistic chance for big gains.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/923316772227153959/986718938215903263/C9FE02B1-C8B1-4E17-8496-E0EE59C7DB48.jpg?width=309&amp;amp;amp;height=667&quot;&amp;gt;Safemoon spent the better part of a year advertising that their LP’s are locked and therefore it’s “Safe” and “unruggable”.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In fact, that’s the original Dev saying how the LP’s are locked. There is one locked LP which is faithfully locked for a couple more years, but the other LPs are getting drained constantly.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Safemoon is a token with no revenue stream. The devs aren’t selling anything to anyone, and at the start of this year, they changed the tax system so they now receive 1% of all transactions. However, the wallet that receives those 1% has barely been withdrawn from, yet all the devs live lavish lives with McLarens, mansions, private jets, gold-plated steaks… so where did all that money come from?  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Rhetorical questioning aside, here’s the nuts and bolts of what’s going on.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;John Karony is taking thousands of BNB (worth over $6m today) out of the V1 LP and using it to buy V2 tokens on the open market. There are several problems with this:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Safemoon are custodians of the LP, they do not own the LP contents because they didn’t pay for those tokens directly. Therefore it is not their money to spend and this will be seen as theft. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;By buying tokens on the open market, they are pumping the price in a clear manipulation effort. This is the second time John has done this while the price of Safemoon has gone terminal. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;it gives whales a huge heads up to sell their bags at a massive short-term profit. Which is exactly what happened the first time.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;it fools new investors into thinking it’s a real pump, they will buy in and get rekt.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;John is buying himself tokens&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. He’s not just transferring BNB. He’s buying himself millions of dollars worth of Safemoon tokens. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here’s the wallet purchasing the funds with the LP.  Every few seconds it buys another 3.2BNB (a stupid marketing gimmick they have) of Safemoon in the open market. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://bscscan.com/address/0xff53c5fe4d9865fe9c6fa4866f1b4647d4125c82&quot;&amp;gt;https://bscscan.com/address/0xff53c5fe4d9865fe9c6fa4866f1b4647d4125c82&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The CEO has the capability of giving himself tokens from the deployer, pairing them with V1 BNB, and then using the AddLiquidity function to just put the V1 liquidity into the V2 pool, but of course he doesn’t because he wants to enrich himself at Safemoon holders expense.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The US Securities Exchange Act defines market manipulation as &amp;amp;quot;transactions which create an artificial price or maintain an artificial price for a tradable security&amp;amp;quot;. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is quite a clear violation of SEC Market Manipulation rules, and Safemoon &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;DEFINITELY&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; falls under SEC’s guidelines of a security.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The SEC uses something called “the Howey Test” to determine whether or not something qualifies as being a security. The test has a four-part parameter:  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Investment of money… meaning that someone has invested in goods or services&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In a “common enterprise”… meaning that investor’s funds are either interwoven (horizontal commonality) or there’s a direct correlation between the promotion of the investment and its success or failure (vertical commonality)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With an “expectation of profit”… an expectation of profits can be either from fixed returns or capital appreciation&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“Solely on the efforts of others”… meaning that if any profit involved stems from the efforts of the people who promoted the investment, it fulfills the fourth part of the Howey Test&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As you can see, Safemoon fails (or passes?) the Howey Test handsomely.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So, speculation time, why would the CEO do this? Does he want an SEC investigation as a good reason to shut the token down now he’s made his millions? Just a reminder that Safemoon has not delivered one single product from their roadmap apart from the wallet which is entirely unremarkable, and a swap which has poor functionality and only lists other shitcoins.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Because not only does Safemoon fail the Howey test, they’re also inviting an investigation AND risking huge fines / jail time for market manipulation, AND they’re doing this in the midst of THREE Class Action Lawsuits (two of which have been consolidated and a judge has been appointed… meaning… it’s going to court!!).  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You could make a risky play and try and get in to make profit until the address runs out of BNB, BUT, there are well over 100 whales with tens of millions of tokens who are clamouring for an exit. Don’t be their exit liquidity. Plus, it’s Safemoon. Ew, and you need to make over 23% profit just to break even!!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
