This is always laughed at by people saying how bi-polar it is in here. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However, like everything in social media, I believe there are agendas from bots/paid actors, multi accounts that deliberately push to sentiment here in a bullish/bearish direction for their financial gain. They could be either shorting or going long with heavy positions. When the market shifts directions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I have never interacted with so many experts that say crypto is dead now, and only meant for scams/ponzis - the tech is all BS. I also have received many downvotes for stating that crypto, mainly BTC is fine and will rebound - but when crypto is climbing, its filled with upvotes. This heavy sentiment shift leads me to believe there is an agenda to attack indecisive investor emotions to either sell or buy, so they can profiit.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So don&amp;amp;#39;t forget, when there are profits to made that can leverage off the public, the people you are talking to here or other platforms with their crypto advice could actually just be trying to move the market in one direction. In other words they could ultimately believe in BTC but just want to talk crap so you sell, and they scoop up more cheap BTC.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Stick to your plan no matter what people say who just want you to follow the sentiment.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Neither of these amounts has been repaid, and failure by 3AC to repay either requested amount by these specified dates will constitute an event of default. Voyager intends to pursue recovery from 3AC and is in discussions with the Company&amp;amp;#39;s advisors regarding the legal remedies available.

Few hours back just out of curiosity I tried leverage on Binance.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I started with 78 USDT and used leverage of 3x with BTC, voila I made a profit of few dollars and felt like a king. I increased the leverage to 5x and the winning streak continued. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Next, I leveraged with Ethereum and leveraged 10x and it was wonderful. I was feeling on the top of the world, nothing could stop me. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After first timers luck the degen ape in me woke up and I leveraged 25x on ShibaInu and the house of cards came falling in front of me. All of my profit from earlier trades was wiped out and my capital of 78 USDT decimated to 50 USDT. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I was hysterical and went all in on Shiba again with leverage of 50x and recovered my loss and made a mind boggling profit of 5 USDT.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My take from my experiment with leverage : &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Don&amp;amp;#39;t leverage, Don&amp;amp;#39;t play with futures, it is very demanding.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You will be constantly checking prices/profit or loss.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;It is addictive and this gambling can ruin you financially. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;My mental peace was gone and I was barely able to sleep for 2 hours and even in my sleep I was dreaming about charts.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;conclusion - Don&amp;amp;#39;t leverage / play with future else it will destroy your future. If you want to do it properly follow stop-loss.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Given that we are going to get diminishing returns and still get bear markets of -70 or more,  does HODL truly make sense?  We’ve officially reached the cycle where the diminishing returns are so apparent that we breached previous ATH.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It seems that the smartest strategy is to buy in the bear market and sell your whole stack in the bull run.   Obviously you won’t catch the top or bottom but it’s a better way to preserve your capital.   Will you be DCA’ing in the next bull run once/if we break 70k?   I just hate how taking profits it’s frowned in this community and ppl are encouraged to HODL which is a penny stock promoter scam tactic.  To each their own.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You&amp;amp;#39;d think you&amp;amp;#39;re listening to a religious pastor when you hear him spread pretentious ideas about how bitcoin is the future of finance. Lmao. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m sure bitcoin still has big bull runs in its future but I don&amp;amp;#39;t see any evidence of what libertarian hard-core crypto people claim about it happening.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Ultimately though I think much of the massive money that gets put in by whales is to pump up the market and eventually cash a lot out when it gets big enough, and leaves retailers in many cases screwed over. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What do you think, whether you agree or disagree?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The new CEO of Tether. We are a Multi Billion dollar company. That&amp;amp;#39;s at least four zeros in our net worth. But not before a decimal place&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I know that the cryptocurrency space has been generally weary weary of us. Despite us doing audits from people that &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;we&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; trust.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Look. It was hard for us to back the asset 1:1 with a dollar. That shit is mad worthless these days. We did so initially. And it was the plan. But you know, things happen.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But we have heard you guys out. You guys want to know WHAT our tokens are backed by. You DON&amp;amp;#39;T want it backed by &amp;amp;quot;commercial paper&amp;amp;quot; and other fun things. We will do an &amp;amp;quot;actual&amp;amp;quot; audit soon. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is why we shall just swap all 70 billion USDT with DAI, which IS backed by US dollars. Doing some simple math,&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;USDT = DAI = USD&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Bitcoin dominance will consolidate and is already creeping above 70% in terms of volume.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As someone who first bought bitcoin in a barnes and noble off localbitcoins in 2013, I consider myself a Bitcoin Maxi — but I would be lying if I didn’t say that my biggest gains haven’t come from altcoins. Remember that ether itself was once considered a shitcoin. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Historically, here are the two best things you can do during crypto winter:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;DCA into bitcoin&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Study and pick your alts.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Many coins that were by no means unknown in 2018 went on to produce 10-100x gains. Here are some prices for reference on Dec 22, 2017 — right after Bitcoin fell 30% over the course of two days (sound familiar?)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;BNB: $5.54&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Link: $0.57&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;KuCoin: $0.88&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now, one of the bad things about the crypto industry is that people try to it make more complicated than it needs to be. Bitcoin needs a white paper; Floki Shiba Inu Monkey Pox coin doesn’t. This is why I wrote an &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bitscrypto.com/cryptos&quot;&amp;gt;ELI5 Description of Every Coin on Coinbase&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. A few well placed investments into the right alts while dollar cost averaging into BTC/ETH has historically been the best bear market strategy — and there is no reason to think this time around is any different.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Even more important than picking the right alts is to &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;set up a DCA strategy and stick to it&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. I like to keep my crypto investments proportional to how much money I’m actually spending day to day, so I actually wrote myself an ios/android app that rounds up my everyday purchases and invests the spare change into my coinbase portfolio. This is a strategy I’ve been employing for a few years now, but only just recently made the code user friendly enough to be used by strangers and added a “boost” setting so you can ramp investments up and down with spending. I made it free with no current monetization plan (it’s in the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://9u9hu.app.link/e/view&quot;&amp;gt;app store&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, so reviewed by Apple/Google).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

What I am about to post comes from years of study, analysis, and screen time. I have survived multiple Stock Market corrections, the rise and fall of Commodity cycles, Black Swan crashes, and Crypto Bubble/Winters. I also saved many people from losing money before Quadriga exit-scammed the Canadian crypto market in 2018. This post is meant to share--at a high level--what I have learned from losing my own heard-earned dollars in the past.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;TLDR:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Many people here believe that Technical Analysis is witchcraft. What I am about to discuss has nothing to do with indicators, squiggly lines, ratios, sentiment indexes, or making long-term predictions. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;It has to do with understanding how Markets move&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;--something I tried posting about back in Feb when BTC had freshly broken $40K support. Back then I stated that $20K was possible given the momentum of the current downtrend and the economic headwinds that lay ahead. Please check out those posts since there will be a lot of overlap.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Know your Timeframe&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
Technical Analysis comes in many shapes and forms. Some methodologies are better than others, but they all serve different purposes. If you are &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Day Trading&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, certain indicators can help you quickly scalp in/out of moves. If you are &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Swing Trading&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, then another set of indicators will allow you to ride multi-day moves. For &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Position Trading&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; or &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Long-Term Investing&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, there exists other techniques to help you decide when to enter, add, hold, trim, or exit positions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Ask yourself: How long am I willing to hold onto an asset for a return? The answer to that will determine how closely you should monitor the charts. It also dictates how often you should be buying/selling positions. Below is SPY vs. BTC and demonstrates that both are in &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Macro Uptrends (Bull Markets).&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/k0llijt0it691.png?width=1432&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=3e3527f47f117b8863027fe3775d3e03eb945821&quot;&amp;gt;S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 - 100 Year Chart (log scale)&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/yf7rr800it691.png?width=1214&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=8928bb6a440d2b483ac9595cf1326c7a9a5f845c&quot;&amp;gt;Bitcoin - 10 Year Chart (log scale)&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Personally I don&amp;amp;#39;t use any technical indicators except for Trend Analysis, Moving Averages, and Support/Resistance. Combined, they tell me the direction the market is moving, what price is currently doing, and how much room until the next price area where a reaction is likely. Below is a crash course in the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Trend Analysis&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; portion.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The Market Cycle&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
Directional price movement is based on a fundamental concept called the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Market Cycle&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. You may have seen variations of the graphic below which sometimes overlay the emotions tied to each stage (euphoria, panic, capitulation, etc.). Zoom-in to a 1-minute chart or zoom-out to a Weekly chart--you will see the market going through these 4 stages like clockwork. This is because humans (and the algos they program) have been buying/selling assets in this manner &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;for centuries&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/ypen8d0fgt691.png?width=812&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=63d544959740512f2d376595e70b3c2365142fe2&quot;&amp;gt;Four Stages of the Market Cycle. Exists on all timeframes: represents human emotion.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The Building Block&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
Nothing goes up/down in a straight line. Price tends to move in waves, both during Markup (&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;uptrends&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;) and Markdown (&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;downtrends&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;). There are pullbacks/consolidations along the way as buyers and sellers take profit, get out at break-even, or re-enter to drive the next leg. If you are familiar with &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;pivots&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; then you should understand the graphic below.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/e70bpbufjt691.png?width=986&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=77b2506b40ebfe5db6393c58e3ff00fa193ce0bb&quot;&amp;gt;The typical pivot structure seen in Uptrends and Downtrends. Impulse move in active direction; retracement back. Repeat.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Remember above where I said timeframe matters? This is important because up/down legs in larger timeframes consist of up/down legs on smaller timeframes. This is how you can get a micro uptrend during a macro downtrend. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;So no--each little pullback is a not a fake Pump or a Dump. It is not a Bull Trap or a Bear Trap.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; It is the Market doing it&amp;amp;#39;s thing; become familiar with this ebb and flow movement, please. It will help keep your blood pressure levels more stable.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/adnzl7ysjt691.png?width=990&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=715554470a0df1558a0c685e6527ea98fb43fe0b&quot;&amp;gt;The Fractal - How smaller timeframe legs can exist in larger timeframe trends&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/53ef3t3flt691.png?width=1218&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=2dd05ce68493180764b08091300d3b721d655929&quot;&amp;gt;Example: BTC 1H Chart - Currently in an hourly uptrend inside of a Daily/Weekly downtrend.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The Trend is Your Friend and the Truth&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
When price begins a directional move, this is called an Uptrend or a Downtrend. Trends are the most powerful force in the Market. An Uptrend means that people are willing to pay more and more for an asset (greed); in a Downtrend people are selling for less and less (fear). &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The trend should be respected as long as it is active.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; As obvious as this sounds: the goal is to buy during an uptrend and sell during a downtrend. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The majority of retail has no problem with the former, but they fail to do the latter. Bagholding.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/wxl2xp96nt691.png?width=861&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=2ca7a9de5e220b02274a1e55ce7002e58f2f2b28&quot;&amp;gt;Classic Uptrend - Pivot Structure repeats and leads to higher prices&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/cn4dp6h7nt691.png?width=788&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=2430f622e88a46ade95f9c78947cbb00b85ded6e&quot;&amp;gt;Classic Downtrend - Pivot Structure repeats and leads to lower prices&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Healthy trends typically continue until they lose structure. This may occur at areas of support/resistance (BTC $20K, anyone?). At important technical levels, price can either consolidate and resume the trend, or it can enter Stage 1 (accumulation). &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Trying to predict the absolute bottom is a fool&amp;amp;#39;s game.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; You will run out of fingers before finally catching that knife. There is a graveyard filled with accounts who think that &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;this single candle&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; is the reversal point.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Side note:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; I blame knife-catching on the old adage of &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Buy low, Sell high&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;. The true way to get involved is to ride an uptrend and &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Buy high, Sell higher&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;. And vice versa in a downtrend: &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Short low, Cover lower&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The Consolidation Base&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
I have seen the term &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Crab&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; or &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Bart&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; used a lot in this sub. In Trend Analysis it is called a C&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;onsolidation&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;. This is a special type of pullback within an active trend. Rather than correcting through price (retracement), the chart corrects through time (sideways). This price action is considered very Bullish (uptrend) or very Bearish (downtrend) because it means that the opposing side is unable to even form a pivot. Orders stack at the extremities of the range, and once the ceiling/floor is taken out: BAM! It is my favorite pattern of all time due to its potency.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/9hz8s3huot691.png?width=1215&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=3a525277418414165783cf825ea4ed8df95afd56&quot;&amp;gt;BTC - Two Consecutive Breakdowns since the $48k fake-out. Pattern Failures lead to powerful moves as many are caught off-sides.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s Better to Be Late to the Right Party than Early to the Wrong Party&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
One thing that TA provides is an educated guess into what is likely to occur in the immediate future. There is little value in overlaying previous cycles for comparison since every market situation is unique. Each trend occurs during different fundamental and economic conditions. There are also new market participants. That being said, nobody can predict the future; all we can do is analyze what the chart is telling us. And in the cryptocurrency market, at this very moment, we are in a classic downtrend until proven otherwise.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As an active trader, your goal is to make an educated guess regarding the next few candles that will appear on the right-hand side of the chart. That is it. You set a stop and take profit at your targets. If-then statements; rinse and repeat.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As a long term investor, you should become familiar with Trends: how they are born, how they behave when active, and how they end. Pull up a chart of BTC right now and ask yourself: what stage of the market cycle we are in?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Case Study&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
I will leave you with this textbook example of a Market Cycle that spanned about 15 years from Bottom to Bottom. I&amp;amp;#39;m not saying that crypto will mirror or follow this whatsoever. It is meant to help you identify the pivots, trend structure, and big picture. Notice how the bottom was confirmed &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;after the fact&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;: Once price failed to make a Lower Low (LL) and made a Higher High (HH)? Getting in when a Stage 1 morphs into Stage 2 (i.e. the backside) is the safest/smartest entry for the next Bull Run.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/r7dse66t2u691.png?width=1350&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=df6a768c6de3e17c97c400a0964b481dad647cde&quot;&amp;gt;Real-Life Market Cycle - Random Asset Monthly Chart 2001-2018&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Nobody every gets out the absolute top or in at the absolute bottom. Accepting that fact has helped me navigate the markets without my biases and emotions getting in the way.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Disclaimer:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Not financial advice. Sold majority of Crypto end of 2021. 100% cash since early May. Will attempt to re-enter on next Stage 2.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

But based on the current climate, and your gut, how long a bear market do you we reckon we are in for? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Personally I think it’s going to be a long one, as in 2024/25 before we see any real upturn. Admittedly the next halving may speed things up a bit but I’ll be very impressed if we’re not looking at a minimum of 2-3 years of bear. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On the plus side, it’s 2-3 years to fill those bags :)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyway, that’s my 2 cents. Is anybody thinking longer or shorter?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s been said here before, but Solana is a scam: I knew it from the second I heard the CEO of the development company describe the &amp;amp;quot;network switch model&amp;amp;quot; of &amp;amp;quot;doing one thing (high scalability and throughput for dApps) and doing it well&amp;amp;quot;. Here&amp;amp;#39;s my reasoning:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I work in the tech industry, and I can show you a ledger that can scale faster and for cheaper than Solana right now. Moreover, it&amp;amp;#39;s more stable and you&amp;amp;#39;ll have next to no problems using it b/c &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;the underlying tech has already been in use since the &amp;amp;#39;70s&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;... It&amp;amp;#39;s called a SQL database. It can handle millions of TPS even without complex scaling schemes, and it gets faster as you add more machines to it. You can run pretty much any financial application you want on top of it with no problems b/c, in fact, &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;all of traditional finance is already built on top of it&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;. Instead of using a complex language like Solidity or Rust, devs can literally use JavaScript. You can even log into it with your Facebook account!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The problem is: What I&amp;amp;#39;m describing is 100% centralized. In fact, it&amp;amp;#39;s literally the technical foundation for all centralization of data; it&amp;amp;#39;s the bookkeeping layer behind the billions and trillions of dollars that the banks and big tech are screwing people out of every day (the &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;settlement layer&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, if you will).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The point I&amp;amp;#39;m getting at is that: &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;If you have a ledger that can be rolled back at the discretion of a central group of authorities, then it&amp;amp;#39;s literally a glorified database being run by a glorified bank.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; If you have no problem with this, then you&amp;amp;#39;re in crypto for the wrong reasons; therefore, I suggest it&amp;amp;#39;s time to reexamine things.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

It is a good price if you have your own money to invest, borrowing money from a bank to invest in crypto even if it&amp;amp;#39;s low APR% it&amp;amp;#39;s not advisable and you shouldn&amp;amp;#39;t do it. Losing your own money might sound bad, but imagine you&amp;amp;#39;ve lost borrowed money, which you&amp;amp;#39;ll have to pay back eventually. A simple quote that everybody heard a dozen times; don&amp;amp;#39;t invest what you can&amp;amp;#39;t afford to lose. Seems to me people still don&amp;amp;#39;t get the principle of it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can play around with your own money, nobody gives a f, if you lose it. Playing with borrowed money, not so much, it can f**k up your life in a variety of ways. You&amp;amp;#39;ll owe more money in penalties, interest charges will get higher and your credit score will fall as well, not to mention mental problems that could come along the way.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With that being said, if you took a loan to invest in crypto, I wish you the best, also we&amp;amp;#39;re looking forward to seeing your results, and I hope everything turns out well for you.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There are explicit taxes that impact me and my earning potential such as income taxes, property taxes, sales taxes, payroll taxes, state and local taxes. There are also implicit taxes that affect me in ways that are a bit more difficult to quantify like inflation (an invisible tax that diminishes the purchasing power for the dollars I keep) and corporate taxes (revenue that could have all or in part gone into employee salaries). &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Months prior I listened to a podcast with Robert Breedlove where he discussed the idea that one’s effective tax rate is a representation of how much a slave one is to the state. A statement I felt was bold, but the argument was interesting: what is slavery if not a 100% tax on your time and energy? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I decided to take the challenge and determine how much a &amp;amp;quot;slave&amp;amp;quot; I really am. I reviewed my paycheck, my property tax bill, my monthly purchases and my state tax rate. The result surprised me to say the least. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here are the numbers represented as a percentage of my gross income: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Federal Income Tax: 26.16% &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;State Income Tax: 10.66% &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Medicare Tax: 2.16% &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Disability Tax: 1.64% &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Social Security Tax: 9.25% &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Property Tax: 4.94% &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Monthly Expense Sales Tax (@ 7.75% rate): 2.71% &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Total Tax: 57.52%&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And that’s just explicit taxes. The latest Consumer Price Inflation print for June 2022 was 8.6%. Simply adding the CPI figure into the sum puts me at a 66.12% total tax rate. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For every 3 hours of work, the value created by 2 is taken from me and given to the government. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I am 66% slave. How about you?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also if you just think logically of we reverse now this would be the shortest bear marjet Crypto has ever had.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The crypto market is crashing because of interest rate hikes (because debt becomes more expensive and people suddenly wants less of it). Inflation is not dealt with yet and we&amp;amp;#39;ll see more rate hikes. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Worst case scenario is a global housing crash and financial meltdown. Crypto has never seen that before, but we can be pretty sure it won&amp;amp;#39;t thrive in those conditions either.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Don&amp;amp;#39;t buy crypto now unless you&amp;amp;#39;ve got money to spare and you are prepared to hold for several years. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Save some money for your debt, or to buy into housing if that market crashes too.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: There seem to be some confusion about what my &amp;amp;quot;advice&amp;amp;quot; really is. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m not saying that crypto will definitely keep declining, although it&amp;amp;#39;s likely, but rather that there is an alternative cost to your investments as the interest rates increases. It never hurts to have a liquid buffer when there&amp;amp;#39;s hard times ahead, and your indirect profits from paying off a 4% mortgage could potentially be higher than profits from crypto investments made now.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
