It has not yet announced that Ruble is backed by gold, but the Russian central bank has said it will exchange ruble with gold and vice versa for a fixed rate. This has resulted in Ruble&amp;amp;#39;s value stabilising, and is now above the levels before the start of its invasion.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/bx4b6y28guq81.jpg?width=1385&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e4e3f1bdc1e15d29d300195e79d469e3ca98379c&quot;&amp;gt;Ruble is trading above invasion day levels. &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Using Gold , they are sidestepping sanctions. Yet I cannot find any chatter of how gold is being used to side step sanctions, by the usual talking heads like Elizabeth Warren who tried to make a case that crypto could be used by Russia. She even brought out some Act in Congress agains this.. but Russia is actually using gold, and she is silent as a mouse on this issue. Does she love her gold jewellery so much that she cannot bear to see it being linked with the enemy using it for nefarious purposes?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They just want to make a worst case scenario for everything related with crypto, and are willing to disregard what is actually happening. Where is the &amp;amp;quot;Protect Gold From Enemies&amp;amp;quot; Act ?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Russia has not used crypto whatsoever, yet hundreds of articles and forums were keenly discussing just the possibility. In many places you couldn&amp;amp;#39;t reason with the mob that Russia cant use crypto given they cannot even access liquid exchanges that are all based out of the West. No one cared, everyone used it as an occasion to smear crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now that Russia&amp;amp;#39;s government is using gold, all of these people are silent. It is fine to use gold ,but if they use crypto then they will raise their voices? The levels of hypocrisy are off the charts.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Like on the last vote (where we took massive action contacting the MP&amp;amp;#39;s) regarding the POW proposed ban, the votes were very evenly divided.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On the POW ban, that failed to pass by a small margin. On today&amp;amp;#39;s vote regarding the crack down on unhosted wallets and privacy, it passed by a thin margin because we didn&amp;amp;#39;t take action like last time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Please read the related threads (like Patrick Hansen, Unstoppable Finance, Coinbase, etc. on Twitter), there&amp;amp;#39;s still time to make a difference in subsequent steps before the law is finalized and enacted.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We need to come together in these crucial votes to tip the balance towards privacy, independence, liberty, justice, freedom. If we do nothing, tyranny and centralization of power will keep growing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto has hopes of solving many problems but people aren&amp;amp;#39;t able to wrap their minds around it (Nfts made it even harder). On top of that most of crypto is hard. Part of the reason most people are still using exchanges to store crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Seeing coins like SHIB, DOGE in the past has only encouraged these people in their thinking that they can make a lot of money off of these coins, when the reality is that those 2 were only 2 among thousands of coins that got lucky. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Investing should be done with a purpose, otherwise it becomes pure gambling and you&amp;amp;#39;ll likely fail. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That purpose could be Bitcoin as a means of decentralization, as a means of inflation hedge, or just as a currency that&amp;amp;#39;s easy to transfer. As long as you know what you support in your coin, you have a purpose in it that you believe. Which is what investing is, not closing your eyes and picking a coin. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Not only you won&amp;amp;#39;t be rich, but you&amp;amp;#39;ll also lose your money in these coins. Only people getting rich will be those controlling the coin with their bags that are ready to sell. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But of course, there still are those projects with purpose and that can change the market, but you&amp;amp;#39;ll need a lot of time on your hands to find those new ones.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency has seen a spike in interest this year ahead of a widely anticipated shift to a proof-of-stake (PoS) model. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;ETH price has surged over 20% in the past two weeks, and was trading at around $3,400- close to breaking even for the year. Daily volumes have also steadily risen, averaging at roughly $20 billion over the past week.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;BTC price also shot up to 2022 highs this week, and was trading around $47,000. But while volumes did increase, they were substantially lower than the massive amounts of liquidity seen in 2021. Still, the world’s largest cryptocurrency commanded over 40% of total crypto market capitalization.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But the latest crypto rally has also seen several altcoins vastly outperform BTC, while notching record highs in market capitalization. A similar scenario was observed during the start of the 2021 rally, which had eventually challenged BTC’s dominance.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And so the question is will &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://getblock.io/nodes/eth/?utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;amp;utm_campaign=promo&quot;&amp;gt;ETH&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; lead the next Bull Run?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Inflation is running rampant and recently crossed a whopping 7%... Worse than we’ve had in about 40 years.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you’re interested in going anywhere, it’ll cost you about 40% more than this time last year just to fill up your gas tank. And that’s only the tip of the iceberg…&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you grasp what’s going on, you’ll know that a 3% raise isn’t helping you at all when you’re losing 7%...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In order to counter this, storing money in an appreciating investment vehicle is an absolute MUST.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Otherwise, the value of your dollar will continue going down as the AMOUNT of dollar you have stays the same…&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Even if you’re not great at math, I think you can see where that’s headed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

A token with high trading fees which were supposed to go towards the cost of paying people to work towards getting businesses to accept crypto. It gets a lot worse…&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He partnered with another guy Myles G that was previously in prison for &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://miami.cbslocal.com/2011/05/18/men-trick-woman-steal-her-rolex/&quot;&amp;gt;fraud and robbery&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; at gunpoint… (what could go wrong? SMH)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He initially tried to call it Accept Doge but The Dogecoin Foundation pulled their trademark card and stopped him from doing it on the threat of &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/billym2k/status/1506443665245413382?s=21&amp;amp;amp;t=3gkaxm-DminXh7TsC9lomA&quot;&amp;gt;legal action.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Dogecoin Community has been angry at Matt for weeks/months about this and other things as he is also a prominent Dogecoin Pumper that pushes unfounded rumors in his Twitter and YouTube channel.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This isn’t the first time he’s done something like this, other tokens of his have also been rugpulled. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/baby-lambo-inu/&quot;&amp;gt;Baby Lambo Inu&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Once trading started it acted as a honeypot, people could buy but couldn’t sell. A few short periods allowed trading as liquidity was drained. A total of $600K+ in ETH was drained from the project.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here is a recording of the Telegram call with his Patreon supporters right after they found out &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-s1Q7ErBoBM&quot;&amp;gt;they couldn’t sell and later exit liquidity was drained&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Allegedly it was supposed to be a fair launch but it went live for his patron supporters first and they were advocating in private channels to buy and dump on the greater market once it was live for everyone. [if this is true] instead they got hit with a honeypot.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: Here a &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/22/03/26365071/dogecoin-influencer-matt-wallaces-exit-scam-costs-investors-600k-ethereum&quot;&amp;gt;news article&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; on it, it reiterates some of this but is limited in scope of background info.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I believe that netflix in  recent years has become one of the companies with the most power of influence, alongside META. Every Netflix series, film and documentary  has a hidden agenda or at least subliminal messages that always point to the same ideology, and worst of it all ... is that they are very good at  doing this.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I don&amp;amp;#39;t want to make this a political issue or spread  conspiracy theories because I&amp;amp;#39;m here to talk about the new Netflix  series &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Trust No One: The Hunt For The Crypto King&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; the title itself  already tells us the message they want to get across. The documentary  tells the story of the alleged bankruptcy of Canada&amp;amp;#39;s largest crypto  broker, and for someone who understands the concepts of crypto watching  the documentary is almost impossible, they try to look impartial and  factual but it becomes clear that they are not.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They  begin by framing what Bitcoin is to the viewer, the biggest reasoning for the people who invest in BTC is just &amp;amp;quot;rebelling against the system&amp;amp;quot;, they refusing to talk about key topics like decentralization, inflation, too much government power, security  or even the concept of limited supply.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/0mtvsm5zuhq81.jpg?width=599&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=6bf5d93c97abf298d07bd290d1ee0ea5ce5a099e&quot;&amp;gt;Why the bloody fingerprint tho?&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For the average person this what  BTC is, a virtual currency that people grab by faith or rebellion, if  Bitcoin is so recognized and even so it is so useless imagine what the  average person will think of other cryptocurrencies in an industry that  is advertised as a ponzi scheme and a world full of scams, But I&amp;amp;#39;m  rambling already. This is the &amp;amp;quot;good&amp;amp;quot; part of the documentary, from there  Netflix uses all the dirty tricks to manipulate the viewer.. Those who  invest in crypto:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;do not have time to exercise&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;are nerds&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;are looking to get rich fast&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;want to buy luxury cars (this is partially true)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;have no basic understanding of markets or how money works&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;are naive and easily manipulated (I see the irony)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They interview a guy that wanted to get rich fast as his friend did, so he asks for a high interest loan of the value of 85k$, what happens? he buys BTC high and the price crashes (typical redditor investor s/), he now is fu****, has to sell his house... but that is not enough, he proceeds to send 400k to the exchange with the intention to avoid bank fees, and now he lost all his money on QuadrigaCX scam...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This  documentary is a shameful attack on crypto but there is something good to pull out of here, Netflix and the big media have to resort to these  strategies because in a debate of ideas they lose.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They may try to postpone crypto, but they&amp;amp;#39;re postponing the inevitable, I just  feel bad for the people who are manipulated by these kinds of  documentaries.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thank you for your attention, I don&amp;amp;#39;t advise you to watch this , I wasted my time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

You don&amp;amp;#39;t see that too often, so I was curious when it happened last, and how rare it really is. So I looked into it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the past 10 years, BTC had (at least) 8 consecutive green days in a row only 16 times, most of them in the very early days. 7 of those were in 2012, 2 in 2013, 2 in 2015, and once each each year from 2016 to 2021, except 2018. The longest streak ever was in 2012 (15 days), after 2012 the longest streak was 10 days (happened twice, once in 2013 and once only last year, in July 2021).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That means that BTC only needs two more green candles to tie the record for after 2012 - and one more to break it. As I am writing this, the daily candle is slightly green again, but it&amp;amp;#39;s very close. Let&amp;amp;#39;s hope for green days all week, let&amp;amp;#39;s make this the longest streak in 10 years!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

One post in particular argued that centralisation is needed from the start of a project&amp;amp;#39;s journey to encourage development. I believe that decentralisation is the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;ONLY&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; point of crypto and should be sought out as a priority and not be a future promise. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto has so many comparable non-crypto centralised alternatives, which can provide the same features. Here is a small list of features that crypto can offer, and a centralised/non-crypto alternative:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Store of Value - Gold/Silver/general commodities&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Transfer of money - PayPal/CashApp/Payoneer&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Yield products - Bonds/Some investment trusts/REITs&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Investment opportunities - Stock market/Private Equity/Fine Art&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;NFTs - ownership papers&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Privacy - Cash (admittedly weak, I’m not an XMR shill I promise)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I’m sure I’m missing a few, but my point is that one can access all of these features in a centralised manner. What crypto offers is the ability to access all of these features in a trustless way. I.e. You no longer rely on PayPal to “allow” you to send and withdraw money, it is all done by the network instead. The only differentiating factor between these centralised options and crypto is that crypto does not rely on companies/middle men.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;All other features of a crypto, say fast speed, low fees, and any other great technical advancements, are just a means to make the decentralised product better, but are not the main feature by any means.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Take BTC. It sits at #1 because it is the best store of value of any crypto, but the reason it has any value in the first place is because it is decentralised.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Bitcoin has nearly a trillion dollar market cap and is the 9th most valuable asset in the world. I wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t call that being &amp;amp;quot;early&amp;amp;quot; anymore. Ethereum is #20. Large companies are now buying these assets. The days of 100x your money in a year is basically over. As for the shitcoins that do do that, look at the volume at the start. Barely anyone was trading back then.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Do I think there is still a lot of room for crypto to grow? Yes, but this isn&amp;amp;#39;t 2011 anymore. Most people who buy now aren&amp;amp;#39;t going to make insane gains and that&amp;amp;#39;s just the truth of it. There are ~18,000 shitcoins in existence now, back in 2011 there were maybe 5. And the industry just started back then, now it&amp;amp;#39;s been around for 12 years. Much different ballgame now than it was back then. I&amp;amp;#39;d say we are somewhere in the middle. Big gains can still be made but don&amp;amp;#39;t make the mistake of thinking this is 2011 and expecting a 1000x in one year.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: clearly people missed the point. We are relatively early, but the way some people are talking, they think they can turn $1,000 into $1,000,000. We are at a level where I could reasonably see most coins doing a 10-20X in 10 years. Amazing returns, but unless you put a ton in, not Ultra-rich&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

On the other side we all also want that Crypto just keeps doing 10x every year so that we make a lot of money.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Don&amp;amp;#39;t know about you but having something as a world currency that occasionally does a 10x up and down, seems chaotic to say the least.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And I personally think it&amp;amp;#39;s completly okay to see Crypto as a investment than a currency right now. But I would also say that at one point Crypto will be so big that it would be stabke on the price. Meaning we won&amp;amp;#39;t see any major dips but also not any 10x or so over a short period. This may be the only way of Crypto as a currency.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Obviously we all want to make some money but the greater cause of Crypto wouod not fulfill that. And I&amp;amp;#39;m ready that one day Crypto won&amp;amp;#39;t be as fun as today but more useful to everyone.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
