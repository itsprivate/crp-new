This may be a big generational change. In the US a lot of people were already invested in the stock market and in their 401K. But in a lot of European countries people are not invested in the world of Finance (for example in France the retirement is nationalized so people have less incentive to make their own portfolios)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One of the underestimated aspect of crypto is the education provided to people about financial products, markets, and many other aspects of money management. DeFi and Crypto are often described as the democratization of Finance and it may very well be true. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This change will radially modify how people think about money !&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Most exchanges were run by weebs out of their parents basements. Mt. Goxx wiped out a whole generation of potential crypto millionaires. There were no adults in the room.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These days, there are reputable exchanges available. Coinbase isn’t going to exit scam when they’re publicly traded on the NASDAQ. You might get into trouble if you’re trading with 1000X leverage on Bitmex or buying AssCoin on Cryptopia2, but you can assess your own level of risk.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We’re at the point where you hear way more stories about people getting robbed holding their own keys than you do losing their coins on exchanges. How much of this is user error? Probably most of it, but most people aren’t experts. Telling crypto beginners to get their coins off of exchanges ASAP is a great way to get them to lose it all and swear of crypto forever. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I know crypto folks like to gatekeep and clown on people losing their coins in stupid ways, but if the dream is mass adoption, it’s not going to happen if it’s inaccessible to normies and hazardous to use. Reputable exchanges are the best case scenario for 90% of the population owning crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In 2021, there’s nothing wrong with keeping your coins on an exchange if it’s a reputable one. I get the whole freedom angle, but freedom comes with risks that most people aren’t ready for.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I see a lot of folks talking about Biden&amp;amp;#39;s Executive or next month, America Competes Act and the CBDC&amp;amp;#39;s being provisioned.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If crypto wasn&amp;amp;#39;t seen as an issue it wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t need an executive order.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TLDR&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The US has a network of Federal Reserves that when in other countries is called World Banks and the IMF. They are losing control of the money supply, they are getting ready to fight back.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Government is whack and President Blunder is about to use an executive order to come after crypto. History tells us that this can be pretty extreme if we reference what Roosevelt did with Executive order  6102; to confiscate gold.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With out question this is being sold as a matter of national security&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102&quot;&amp;gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;****To be clear I am not saying they are coming to confiscate crypto, I am saying they are coming to regulate the shit out of it. IT compete with banks, it competes with wall street, it competes with the federal reserve, it competes with the IMF***&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Here is how screwed up the use economy is (each with definitions and explanations for those who want to learn):&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Let&amp;amp;#39;s be very clear the American and world economy is on the brink of complete collapse.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The synthetic CDO&amp;amp;#39;s of 2008 were never fixed, they gave banks money&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEXTqtH-Oo4&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEXTqtH-Oo4&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The student loan crisis cant be fixed because of an investment tool like the above called SLABS&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/081815/student-loan-assetbacked-securities-safe-or-subprime.asp&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/081815/student-loan-assetbacked-securities-safe-or-subprime.asp&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Covid is causing massive supply chain issues so sales and manufacturing cant recover * if we can sell stuff and there are shortages the price will rise and wages will drop.**&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.supplychainbrain.com/articles/34435-global-supply-chains-near-make-or-break-point-for-easing-in-2022&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.supplychainbrain.com/articles/34435-global-supply-chains-near-make-or-break-point-for-easing-in-2022&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Inflation is recking the world economy&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Covid is going to endemic status but may evolve to get worse.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Wall street is using the Federal Reserve as a piggy bank and the fed is using the Plunge Team to stop the financial collapse. Repos and reverse repos are at a record high as hedge funds are over-leveraged and in the extreme Red.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What is the plunge team&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/plunge-protection-team.asp&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/plunge-protection-team.asp&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;_______________________&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Empires don&amp;amp;#39;t invade other countries to control people they do it to control economies and resources&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This includes pillaging their own:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Its imperative to remember that the USA gave US citizens 1200 bucks and small businesses a fractured 2-time ppp system that was highly flawed but bailed out major corporations and banks at 120 billion per month.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;SO I dont know what to expect but I can tell you Executive order  6102 led to the confiscation of US citizens gold&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Executive Order 9066  This post-Pearl Harbor order, now &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://time.com/4574680/muslim-registry-japanese-internment/&quot;&amp;gt;infamous&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, gave the military the ability to mark out areas from which it would be possible to exclude “any and all persons.” The upshot of this move was that more than 100,000 Japanese-Americans and Japanese immigrants were sent to&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://time.com/4575821/mike-honda-internment-camp-registry/&quot;&amp;gt; internment camps.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Executive Order 10340   This order directed the Secretary of Commerce to “take possession of” American steel plants. The order put to rest a &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://time.com/vault/issue/1952-04-21/page/26/&quot;&amp;gt;threatened&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; strike . Steelworkers striking was a &amp;amp;quot;threat&amp;amp;quot; to national security.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.trumanlibrary.gov/education/presidential-inquiries/steel-strike-1952&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.trumanlibrary.gov/education/presidential-inquiries/steel-strike-1952&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Executive Order 13228 established the department of homeland security and turned America into a terrorist-fearing hell scape and took tax dollars and gave them to military contractors in mass.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;_______________________________&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea are all being used as threats to roll out this new executive order to preserve the economy.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/08fjzg7q1ie81.png?width=1876&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=9df4d77607141baf5b1de22b150d08c16c243fe5&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/08fjzg7q1ie81.png?width=1876&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=9df4d77607141baf5b1de22b150d08c16c243fe5&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://rules.house.gov/sites/democrats.rules.house.gov/files/BILLS-117HR4521RH-RCP117-31.pdf&quot;&amp;gt;https://rules.house.gov/sites/democrats.rules.house.gov/files/BILLS-117HR4521RH-RCP117-31.pdf&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/jbrcihmx1ie81.png?width=2048&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=475ff52e8c978278411626a76dee2b57e0725d96&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/jbrcihmx1ie81.png?width=2048&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=475ff52e8c978278411626a76dee2b57e0725d96&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I will leave on this final note. There are 2 ways to enforce policy in the USA;  Legislation and litigation. If you don&amp;amp;#39;t have laws for a situation (legislation) you go to litigate ( go to court) and get a precedent using older or other laws.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The SEC is currently losing badly against Ripple in court.  ( They wont get a precedent) So they are turning to legislation (create new enforceable laws).  Ripple is designer really to send VERY LARGE transactions instantly across the planet.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This directly competes with the CBDC and the Fednow Instant payment system coming out.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/fednow_about.htm&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/fednow_about.htm&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is an instant payment service for countries and large businesses  (banks, hedge funds, etc)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/fednow_about.htm&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/fednow_about.htm&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The IMF and Federal Reserve is looking to replace the ACH and payment systems&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto and block chain systems make RTGS and ACH old outdated tech&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2021/03/global-cyber-threat-to-financial-systems-maurer.htm&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2021/03/global-cyber-threat-to-financial-systems-maurer.htm&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;(RTGS) are funds transfer systems where the transfer of money or securities takes place from one bank to another on a &amp;amp;quot;real-time&amp;amp;quot; and on &amp;amp;quot;gross&amp;amp;quot; basis. Settlement in &amp;amp;quot;real time&amp;amp;quot; means that payment transaction does not require any waiting period. The transactions are settled as soon as they are processed. &amp;amp;quot;Gross settlement&amp;amp;quot; means the transaction is settled on one to one basis without bunching or netting with any other transaction&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Comparatively, ACHs are typically used for low-value, non-urgent transactions while RTGS systems are typically used for high-value, urgent transactions&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_system&quot;&amp;gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_system&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Think of all those poor clearing houses and companies getting a % cut that will be wiped out.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;_________&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Get ready for craziness and cheap crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I am buying up all privacy coins Monero, Dash etc as an investment&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Learn how to use a VPN, Linux is your friend ( Microsoft snitches), and encryption doesn&amp;amp;#39;t hurt.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;_____&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TO all those upset about politics, when politics comes after my crypto.... I get upset&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To those attacking my character:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I am not a right wing conspiracy theorist. I do not want to be doomed to repeat history.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You using an Ad Hominem attack, this is a misdirection and doesn&amp;amp;#39;t talk about the subject matter&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Ad Hominem&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;(Attacking the person): This fallacy occurs when, instead of addressing someone&amp;amp;#39;s argument or position, you irrelevantly attack the person or some aspect of the person who is making the argument. The fallacious attack can also be direct to membership in a group or institution.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To those saying the Biden Camp may support crypto. Just like he kept his promise to forgive student loans until the issue of SLABS as an investment vehicle came up, he sided with Wall Street and the banks.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/081815/student-loan-assetbacked-securities-safe-or-subprime.asp#:%7E:text=1%20Student%20loan%20asset%2Dbacked,much%20like%20an%20ordinary%20bond&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/081815/student-loan-assetbacked-securities-safe-or-subprime.asp#:~:text=1%20Student%20loan%20asset%2Dbacked,much%20like%20an%20ordinary%20bond&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Perhaps he wont side with investors and banks again.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I say you may be right. Its almost possible they would spend 3 months preparing an emergency executive order to regulate a multi trillion dollar industry they adamantly support.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The federal reserve and IMF will just sit back and lose control of the money system and allow the world populace decentralize payment protocols and do nothing. They may just relinquish complete control with out a fight and forgo tariffs and sanctions as a punitive system in Geo politics.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Read here&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It seems like they are going to do nothing and will just let control of the worlds system.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is Geo politics and its bigger than John Doe not paying taxes. Its about Russia and North Korea buying weapons, and sanctions not working.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Its about the US Dollar not being a reserve currency and the Petro dollar breaking down.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The US dollar used to be pegged to gold ( Nixon Changed that) and all other world currency was pegged to the US Dollar. This was established in the Brenton Woods Agreement and System of 1944 &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brettonwoodsagreement.asp&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brettonwoodsagreement.asp&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I suggested that they look into stablecoins, as the value is not going to be volatile, and using the stablecoins to stake on an exchange platform. Speaking as a New Yorker, I think the only platforms I can get this from an exchange are Coinbase and Gemini. Coinbase offers 4% for USDC and Gemini 8.05% GUSD. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I mentioned how I have used Gemini the past 6 months, getting interest compounded daily and just recently had a smooth transaction withdrawing my money from staking and coming in my bank account in what takes no longer than 2 weeks. I informed OP he should do his own research as it doesn’t come without risk, as the money is not FDIC insured so of course he should not be putting ALL his money in an account like this if he is not comfortable. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Every time I am met with downvotes and people spreading misinformation about cryptocurrency in general. It just pisses me off how people can be so misinformed so confidently and stifling discussions. Have do you have the ignorance to boast that a .05% ‘high savings’ bank is the best offer in the market? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Clearly, they need to adjust however they get their information as the times are changing. I’ll keep enjoying my stablecoins gains. :)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TLDR - &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/personalfinance&quot;&amp;gt;r/personalfinance&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; hates crypto, as does 99% of all subs on Reddit&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: I violated the rules on &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/personalfinance&quot;&amp;gt;r/personalfinance&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and I shouldn’t be shilling people on volatile suggestions when there are risk free options. I appreciate the discussion in the comments as we only get to learn when we discuss.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I think this very cool and a smooth user experience to be able to send all of my tokens with one click to another wallet with cheap fees. Cardano may be congested now but this will be a game changer once scaling is here in 2022 imo. I&amp;amp;#39;m following Cardano since 2018 - they may seem to take their time but so far delivering everything according to the roadmap.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My conspiracy theory:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After Putin said for the Russian Central banks to mine bitcoin, Biden&amp;amp;#39;s military advisers gave the green light for Biden to issue an exec order is to print money to buy bitcoin.  It will also to start building nuclear power plants to mine bitcoin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I want to share a milestone of my jurney in the world of crypto curriencies.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After having the issues of freezed funds etc. I am finally my own bank.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I moved all my funds from exchanges into my harware wallet to keep them safe!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It was very simple &amp;amp;amp; easy to set-up the wallet, it also has a perfect interface to follow-up your assets. I recommend everybody to buy their own wallets for their own safety! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I wish you all a great weekend fellow crypto enthusiasts! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What else do you suggest me as a next milestone? Mining, staking? Waiting for your comments!  😀 &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Lets make it really clear from the start: “there are people and parties that wan’t your bitcoin. Preferably cheaper than it is now”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thats all you need to remember. The rest is noise. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yes politics may come and go, different ideas may be thrown around, but don’t for one moment think that if there is money to be made, they will let that chance slide.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Regulations may come and you will probably have to kyc more regularly or in a more specific way.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But banning crypto has proved to be basically impossible. And at this point i don’t even slightly consider it an option and neither should you.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Instead, turn of the bullshit news (because it always is absolute bullshit) and just look for nice price points to get more of your favorite coin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then over a couple of years, look back and enjoy.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Tdlr: you watch too much television/newschannel.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The purchase for the special membership has been reduced to 100 moons, that means Anyone who got minimum 361 karma last round will be able to afford the special membership, while the existing one was 1000 moons which was not that great idea,&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;People who don&amp;amp;#39;t know what special membership is, you see many people with color to their usernames? many people who comments with gif?, yeh with special membership you get to be in the cool kids gang in CC,&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Or I just give the obligatory &amp;amp;quot;I just hope the Kardashians are OK&amp;amp;quot; type response.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He hasn&amp;amp;#39;t said much about all the bank withdrawals and I&amp;amp;#39;ve been waiting for it and am pretty sure I&amp;amp;#39;m &amp;amp;quot;this close&amp;amp;quot; to hearing about it so I quit putting money in. All I keep hearing is &amp;amp;quot;tax time is going to be a bitch with all that crypto stuff your doing&amp;amp;quot; and then as my kids say &amp;amp;quot;butt clench time&amp;amp;quot; but until then I guess I&amp;amp;#39;ll keep moving things around and trying to make the red green and keep the rest as it is.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Every once in awhile I see the &amp;amp;quot;should I tell the wife&amp;amp;quot; posts and ...idk...So...that got me thinking how much does she know? Or for the other 3 ladies and few gents with husbands in here does &amp;amp;quot;he&amp;amp;quot; know? It&amp;amp;#39;s bad enough I&amp;amp;#39;m on my phone in the middle of the night checking things...he&amp;amp;#39;d probably be grateful if it was porn but nope...I&amp;amp;#39;m such a nerd crypto is my side piece. Thoughts?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TLDR - Does you SO know how much you&amp;amp;#39;ve spent/made in crypto? You gonna tell them?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: So, our relationship is good, 23 yrs strong.  We are financially sound and own everything. I&amp;amp;#39;m talking less than 10k. The post was brought on by the downturn where I&amp;amp;#39;m down about 40% and it&amp;amp;#39;s more about being perceived as making a bad investment decision and not wanting to talk about it. I&amp;amp;#39;m not hiding it but he hasn&amp;amp;#39;t asked and I&amp;amp;#39;m not bringing it up. BTW, he&amp;amp;#39;s not perfect either. I&amp;amp;#39;ve also seen a lot of &amp;amp;quot;should I tell the wife&amp;amp;quot; questions and that&amp;amp;#39;s why I asked where everyone&amp;amp;#39;s at ...pure curiosity.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;By all means, it is important that many of these topics within the political sphere are discussed and opposed when they threaten the future of our financial independence, freedom of information, etc.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But really, it gets old fast when you all inject your political views into things.
