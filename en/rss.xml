Crypto.com apparently will offer 4.5% paid out every 7 days in the coin that you invest. It’s been in the back of my head for a bit, but moving that big of a chunk of money (big to me at least..haha) makes my stomach kind of twist. So my question to all of you cryptonauts is, what experience good or bad have you had with using crypto earn. Help me find the cajones to move my bag and start earning interest! TIA.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: I’m aware it is 4.5% annually paid out in 7 day increments. Thanks.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit2: I made the transfer…now I hold my breath for 30 minutes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Posts about crypto usually get bombed with the most classic argument after its all a scam: &amp;amp;quot;crypto is killing the environment due to mining&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I mean it&amp;amp;#39;s right to some extent that crypto is using electricity that is unsustainable for mining. With that dancing the environment. But those people are onto some other stuff. Many thinking that all 5k cryptos use mining that is 100% unsustainable.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So let&amp;amp;#39;s be clear very few cryptos nowadays use pow and even then the energy for mining is getting more and more sustainable. At least already more than their beloved banks.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Seeing so many people uneducated about crypto but spreading hate shows how much growing room we still have left.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Did you take the price chart and take it to art class? If you have doodled and discovered some fun shapes in the chart than you bet your ass it’s &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;technically&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; analyzed!

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Posting this for several years!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Around the same amount that last week. We are looking for around 110 BTC monthly. Way lower that years ago.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Reason? New exchanges, where Binance is king, &amp;amp;quot;the&amp;amp;quot; P2P (with all the risk involved) option to go, not only BTC but other crypto and stablecoins. Easiest way of purchase BTC with devaluated Bolivares (Bs.)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sadly, Binance doesn&amp;amp;#39;t offer the stats of the amound traded. But it is safe to assume Binance (And other exchanges like Reserve and AirTM) has absorbed all the amount that LocalBitcoin used to trade.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Monthly minimum wage is 2 USD that is for public workers and they receive some kind of incentives (a monthly box of food that is around 20 USD), you cannot live with that.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;If that is you only income, you died years ago starving or your family is helping inside Venezuela or from abroad or you have another job or you left the country (even walking).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Average monthly wage is around 90 USD (Monthly). A Manager is around 210 USD (monthly). &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://talcualdigital-com.translate.goog/ovf-salario-promedio-del-sector-comercio-subio-un-71-a-892-durante-2021/?_x_tr_sl=es&amp;amp;amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;amp;amp;_x_tr_hl=en-US&amp;amp;amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp&quot;&amp;gt;https://talcualdigital-com.translate.goog/ovf-salario-promedio-del-sector-comercio-subio-un-71-a-892-durante-2021/?_x_tr_sl=es&amp;amp;amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;amp;amp;_x_tr_hl=en-US&amp;amp;amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Some NGO say around 500 USD monthly are needed for a 5 members family to &amp;amp;quot;live&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;There are in fact so many places (department stores, big ones like Traki, Biomercados) where you can pay directly with crypto. People always use stablecoins like &amp;amp;quot;USDT&amp;amp;quot; (what a fear), USDC, BUSD, AirUSD and so on.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;2021 inflation was around 700%.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you are in cryptoverse, just for the gamble by buying shitcoins, you can go to the casino instead...this isnt called investing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But if you invest, you had did DYOR and diversify your portfolio.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Time will tell, the true diamond hands will be the ones taking the best profit.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the stock market for example buying ETFs, you need at least to invest in a timeframe of 15 years to get some halfway decent gains.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In crypto everything is so accelerated, people lose sight in just 1 month.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It has been over 3 years after Facebook&amp;amp;#39;s announcement of the plans to launch their own stablecoin project Libra which has gathered more that a billion USD from various well known companies and institutions as well. So, for now the project is almost abandoned and dead as per bloomberg. &amp;amp;quot;Meta&amp;amp;quot; recently announced that they are planning to sell the project.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Obviously, this is a clear example why you should avoid VC funded decentralized projects with CEO, CFOs. All those schemes are vulnerable to regulatory annihilation or chief executive rug pull.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;

It is an investment arm of Coinbase to invest in early-stage cryptocurrency and blockchain startups. You can check the portfolio at Messari website.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Their portfolio contains 18 coins as of  now:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Larger market cap ($5B plus): LUNA, MATIC, NEAR, UNI&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Average market cap ($1B plus): GRT, FLOW, AR, CELO&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Small market cap (less than $1B): AUDIO, RLY, UMA, KEEP, RSR, DODO, RARI&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Okay, enough introduction. Let&amp;amp;#39;s see how these coins perform in the last 1 year, from Jan 2021 to date.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;1. Overall performance - ROI 1168%; 15/18 up; 3/18 down&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/axvjaey6c4g81.png?width=925&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=6508771f2076b077e3585e1bbb7ee17cec4cddc5&quot;&amp;gt;Coinbase Venture&amp;amp;#39; portfolio&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Even when the market is still down right now, the return is 1,168%. This is a great return compared to various asset classes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/ujjxpreqc4g81.png?width=463&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=48e6e9b5fb65cd81cdd5efe5c04db7c1b7abe52a&quot;&amp;gt;Comparison to other asset classes&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Except oil, which has a relatively fine return of 93%, the rest isn&amp;amp;#39;t that impressive. And Mr Pete, I&amp;amp;#39;m looking at you. Gold price actually decreased by 7% in the last year.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;2. The top gainers and which are the threes that make losses?&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The top 5 gainers in this portfolio is MATIC, LUNA, AR, NEAR and AUDIO. The most impressive ones are MATIC and LUNA which had returned over 8000%.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/brsh46l4d4g81.png?width=447&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=7e28276133d7844c27b79c70affee776b0088009&quot;&amp;gt;Top gainers and 3 losers&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The losses are actually not that huge, however. It&amp;amp;#39;s quite normal for small cap coins to lose over 90% value in a market downturn. I&amp;amp;#39;d say COMP will go back up pretty quickly once the market improves.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;3. Show me the sectors - which market niches do CV invested in and how do they perform&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now I sort the portfolio based on the sector. You could see BTC stands as a category, even though it&amp;amp;#39;s labelled as &amp;amp;quot;Currencies&amp;amp;quot; as it is the OG cryptocurrency, but nowadays it&amp;amp;#39;s more like a store value of money. BTC is also the staple in the many institutional investor&amp;amp;#39;s holdings.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/0foje1azd4g81.png?width=825&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=84ecbae33684c4167b940c6ff5cb13786ebe4f99&quot;&amp;gt;By sector&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;CV invested quite heavily in smart contract platforms, which features ETH, LUNA, NEAR, FLOW and CELO. I&amp;amp;#39;d also argue that MATIC is closely related, though it&amp;amp;#39;s not a L1, but with the high gas fees of Ethereum, MATIC as the front runner of scalability will be needed for a foreseeable future. All of this category did well, most notably LUNA and MATIC. NEAR also has a good run lately, though it&amp;amp;#39;s not often mentioned in this sub.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m quite surprised that CV didn&amp;amp;#39;t invest in ATOM and DOT, the two front runners of interoperability. However, they did invest in a small cap on this, which is KEEP Network. So far it has doubled in value but probably needs more time to prove its worth.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;DeFi is a little disappointed at the moment, but many has predicted DeFi will see its rise in 2022. CV invested in only 1 lending defi which is COMP.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Other niche markets had been seeing mix results:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Asset management (RSR): down at the moment, but this is also quite new.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Content distribution: AUDIO - which has returns quite nicely as it&amp;amp;#39;s the front runner in music streaming.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Data management (The Graph): doing ok at the moment. It might have the time with Web3.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Exchanges (UNI and DODO): UNI has its time in 2021 like most others, DODO has been in trouble with the hack last year.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;File storage (AR): recently has partnered with Solana. AR is up over 1400% in the last year.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Tokenization (RLY and RARI): above average returns. Social tokens RLY and RARI is for buy/sell NFTs.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;How&amp;amp;#39;s your portfolio doing? Are you happy with your choice of coins? Are you planning to buy or sell anything new? Let me know in the comment.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;*EDIT\&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;*&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I just do another deep dive into the list. Messari list doesn&amp;amp;#39;t list all the coins that Coinbase Venture had invested in.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/is9lcabjr5g81.png?width=838&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=576bf2479bae2ad14f36fd1dd2a145b99fd250e8&quot;&amp;gt;Here is another updated version from Coinbase Venture website&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;CV seems to focus more on the new trend now. One focus I could find is that now they stress on the important of NFT utility phase - so think beyond a picture of a rock that is sold for $1.3M&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/jwawkprtr5g81.png?width=833&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=afa00b8546378b047dfaddf2996313c646bd7195&quot;&amp;gt;Info from Coinbase blog&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For platform and developer tools, the focus is now shifted to Web3, with the tool kits that help the developers to make things happen. Also they pay attention to API such as Alchemy.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/nhx2c898s5g81.png?width=880&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=34195984e01d7fb927dc502569da11d537575c56&quot;&amp;gt;Info from Coinbase blog&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For more info please visit the Coinbase Ventures website. They have a full list of investments. When I have time I can actually look further into which coins do they invested in.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;**EDIT 2*\&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;*&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I could actually find another list of coins that Coinbase Venture had invested in. There are currently 38 coins (under &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Coinbase Ventures Portfolio Screener&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;). &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/g7k72evpq6g81.png?width=1919&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=8d942a57050fc809ddbd745cc84e1e47a01fed72&quot;&amp;gt;Coinbase Venture 38 coins - Portfolio Screener&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This list doesn&amp;amp;#39;t contain BTC or ETH but we all know they own a truckload of BTC and ETH already. Some other interesting picks:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Metaverse / Gaming - SAND - arguably one of the better games in the Metaverse now (stand out against a sea of garbage games)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Smart contracts - MINA, CTK&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Shared compute - LPT: which is kind of similar to THETA, focus on video infrastructure. It did have a pump in Nov 2021 (note not all alts have pumped crazily in Nov 2021)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Derivatives - SNX for Defi application. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

This is not the only similarity - back then BTC pumped from 35k to 39k within 14 hours, while yesterday we saw a pump from 37k to 41k in 9 hours.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This uptrend was short lived and BTC was above 40k for just 2 days, to crash even lower than previously in the next week.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is also worth noting that we are far from &amp;amp;quot;invalidating weeks of FUD&amp;amp;quot; (as one of the top post claims, the one about a potential short squeeze), because we are basically at the support level from just 2 weeks ago - after going below 45k in January, BTC was testing the 40k-41k support for a while, just to crash below it on 20th of January. This was just sixteen days ago!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The only positive aspect about current situation is that you can kind-of see a slight uptrend since hitting 33k on 24th of January when you zoom out, but this means as much as the current alignment of stars on the night sky.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Whether we go &amp;amp;quot;up only&amp;amp;quot; or continue the downtrend remains to be seen. Personally my bets are 50% on going up and 50% on going down, so as you see I have a pretty strong opinion about the current state of the market (;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Nearly always with the same amount, few exceptions when I got a bonus from work etc. Basically, I wanted to go all-in but didn&amp;amp;#39;t have any savings, so decided to buy with max amount that I can, every month from the salary. I kinda had the idea of stacking my way to a million dollars (or euros), however long it would take. Because the way I see Bitcoin, I have no doubt it&amp;amp;#39;s gonna happen. Sooner if I stack more, and later if stack less.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I saw stacking sats become a meme and people posting screenshots on Twitter. But I felt like the bigger picture was missing. How much can you achieve by simply stacking sats all the time? This is my idea of a blueprint. I stack with certain amount and have been doing it for a certain while. You can take a look at the progress and get and idea how it would work for you.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In short, its gonna take time. And its gonna require patience and nerves. Bitcoin is gonna test you, and there&amp;amp;#39;s no shortcuts to success. My advice: start stacking, keep stacking! Promise yourself to stack at least 4 years before you even think about giving up. I document my journey here in the blog. Enjoy reading and I hope you have great success stacking sats!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And what role does Blockchain play in the metaverse? Is it intended to support the persistence and the idea of one true metaverse? But whose Blockchain? Surely anyone can create their own Blockchain for their own metaverse? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Why are people buying virtual land in the metaverse? What utility does it have? And given it&amp;amp;#39;s just a simulation, the land itself is presumably infinite? So why pay for it?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The way the network is built is pure genius and the bigger it gets, the more secure it becomes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In 2011, Dan Kaminsky, a leading Internet-security researcher, investigated the currency and was sure he would find major weaknesses. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Kaminsky is famous among hackers for discovering, in 2008, a fundamental flaw in the Internet which would have allowed a skilled coder to take over any Web site or even to shut down the Internet. Kaminsky alerted the Department of Homeland Security and executives at Microsoft and Cisco to the problem and worked with them to patch it. He is one of the most adept practitioners of “penetration testing,” the art of compromising the security of computer systems at the behest of owners who want to know their vulnerabilities.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Guess what he said when he tried to break Bitcoin?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;“When I first looked at the code, I was sure I was going to be able to break it. The way the whole thing was formatted was insane. Only the most paranoid, painstaking coder in the world could avoid making mistakes.”&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He thought he had identified nine ways to compromise the system and scoured Nakamoto’s code for an insertion point for his first attack. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But when he found the right spot, there was a message waiting for him. “Attack Removed,” it said. The same thing happened over and over, infuriating Kaminsky. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;“I came up with beautiful bugs. But every time I went after the code there was a line that addressed the problem.”&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He was like a burglar who was certain that he could break into a bank by digging a tunnel, drilling through a wall, or climbing down a vent, and on each attempt he discovered a freshly poured cement barrier with a sign telling him to go home. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;“I’ve never seen anything like it,”&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; Kaminsky said, still in awe.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;“Either there’s a team of people who worked on this or this guy is a genius.”&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some countries and cities now like Dubai and New York use more credit cards than cash. Yet the transition from cash to credit cards took a very long time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Meaning crypto will eventually become legal tender if we keep up this pace (and will most probably be adopted faster than credit cards got adopted).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There are even crypto credit cards that are paving the way for crypto payment adoption. They’re so easy to acquire. Platforms like Binance and Coinbase offer them. I have mine from CoinOvy.
These crypto credit cards will be a great way to transition from digital payments to full crypto payments.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They only post FUD about Bitcoin/Crypto, articles full of lies and misinformation. But this great factual article is nowhere to be seen there:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As a major winter storm descends on Texas, crypto miners are powering down operations to help ease the burden on the state’s already beleaguered power grid. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The chief concern is that we might see a repeat of February 2021, when a deep freeze devastated large swaths of the state, leaving 10 million Texans without electricity and resulted in a multisystem meltdown that “was within minutes of a much more serious and potentially complete blackout.” Hundreds of people died amid the multiday outage. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Riot Blockchain, one of the biggest publicly traded crypto mining companies in America, began shutting down power to its Rockdale mine on Tuesday, a process that occurs in phases.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“As the storm has progressed, we have continued to decrease our power consumption by 98%-99%. So currently, we are only using 1%-2% of power,” said Trystine Payfer, Riot’s director of communications. Payfer told CNBC Riot will continue to manage its power usage as needed until there is “no extreme stress on the ERCOT grid.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Riot’s stock closed nearly 7% lower on Wednesday, and it is down over 31% year-to-date. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Several other crypto miners across Texas have followed suit in voluntarily curtailing energy consumption in the run-up to the arctic blast.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The CEO of Rhodium Enterprises, a fully integrated bitcoin miner using liquid-cooled infrastructure, tweeted that Texas-based bitcoin miners were curtailing their load starting Wednesday, in order to “help provide excess power reserves” for the storm. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“We are proud to help stabilize the grid and help our fellow Texans stay warm,” wrote Rhodium CEO Nathan Nichols.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Other crypto miners said they will respond in real-time to the needs of the grid.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The grid is called ERCOT, which is short for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, the organization tasked with operating it. To run smoothly, ERCOT requires a perfect balance between supply and demand. Having too much power and not enough buyers is just as bad as everyone wanting to fire up their air conditioning units on the same day in July.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Whinstone CEO Chad Harris takes CNBC on a tour of the largest bitcoin mine in North America.
Whinstone CEO Chad Harris takes CNBC on a tour of the largest bitcoin mine in North America.
For years, ERCOT has struggled with fluctuating energy prices and sporadic service, which is why it strikes deals with flexible energy buyers, like crypto miners. Through established “demand response” programs, ERCOT will actually pay major industrial users to cut power.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“They’re expecting the same kind of grid load as you would have at peak summertime, so they’ll likely curtail miners at some point on Friday or Saturday,” explained Fred Thiel, CEO of Marathon Digital, another major player in the U.S. mining industry.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitcoin miners specifically, and demand response more generally, are a powerful tool in the toolbox for grid management, according to Lee Bratcher, president of the Texas Blockchain Council.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Marathon’s Thiel tells CNBC that miners have been coordinating with ERCOT since last week to get ahead of any potential problems with the grid.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“Everybody wants to collaborate, everybody wants to voluntarily do whatever it takes to support ERCOT,” he said.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The question now is when the baseload that miners use (the baked-in energy demand from miners as a collective) is shut down and transferred back to the grid, does that provide the grid with what it needs to keep functioning as normal?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“This is a key test moment for the industry,” continued Thiel.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Whether crypto miners going offline en masse in one of the biggest crypto mining jurisdictions in the world will move the price of bitcoin, the answer is probably no.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The supply delta from changing the pace of mining is typically minimal, and any price moves in bitcoin or other major proof-of-work cryptocurrencies would likely have more to do with macro factors and overall risk-off behavior.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;WATCH NOW

A war is brewing among states in the US to attract bitcoin miners
Big test for bitcoin miners
Many in the mining industry tell CNBC that the next few days are a high-stakes way of testing out whether the narrative of crypto miners being good for the grid bears out under pressure. The state’s growing crypto mining contingent ballooned after China banished all crypto miners last May.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“Bitcoin miners want to be good stewards of grid stability,” said Alex Brammer of Luxor Mining, a cryptocurrency pool built for advanced miners. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“We are incentivized financially but also from a political narrative, and therefore, regulatory perspective. We want to show the world we contribute to the health and resilience of the grid, and we know that all eyes will be on us throughout this first big test of the year,” continued Brammer.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That financial incentive is key. Miners are not altruistically opting to do the grid a solid by sometimes powering down some or all of its bitcoin miners to free up electricity for those in need. Instead, there are a lot of financial perks baked into its arrangement with the nonprofit organization that operates Texas’ grid. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“Imagine how much you would have to pay Amazon to say, ‘Hey, there’s too much demand for power. Please power down your data center,’” said bitcoin mining engineer Brandon Arvanaghi, who now runs Meow, a company that enables corporate treasury participation in crypto markets.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“But it can do that with bitcoin very easily, because all you have to do is pay the miners slightly more than what they would have made mining for bitcoin that hour,” continued Arvanaghi, who calls the setup a “a win-win.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If the grid operators pay the miners a penny more than they would have made from mining in any given hour, then they’ll gladly power down. And from Thiel’s experience, they get curtailment requests less than 3% of the time in the course of a year, which he estimates comes to about five to ten hours a month.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Even bitcoin miners that haven’t cut a deal with ERCOT sometimes voluntarily power down at times of peak consumption when prices shoot higher.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The price of power per hour is all over the place, routinely going negative.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Shaun Connell, the EVP of power at Lancium, tells CNBC that in 2020, the price of energy in West Texas was negative between 10% and 20% of the time. The price dips below zero when supply outpaces demand.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In 2021, the price of power per hour was negatively priced 9% of the time, while 5% of all hours peaked above $100. Extreme tails like the ones shown in the chart below aren’t a good thing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Scales
In 2021, had miners voluntarily cut back their uptime expectation from 100% to 95%, they would have slashed their per megawatt hour price from $178 to $25, according to data from Lancium, a Houston-based energy tech company that specializes in bitcoin mining. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Strategically timed energy curtailment proves especially vital for the Texas grid, which exists as its own little island. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Unlike the rest of the continental U.S. that belongs to either the Eastern or Western interconnection (the names of the two interconnected power grids linking states), 90% of Texas runs on ERCOT, a deregulated and independent network of energy providers that is not tethered to any other grid in the U.S. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While this competitive market often drives down the price of power as providers compete on cost to capture customers, it also means that there is less of a safety net baked into the grid. This presents problems in the face of calamitous events, such as a power shortage or a natural disaster, like the fatal winter storm in early 2021. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adding a “controllable load resource” like bitcoin miners to the grid acts as a sort of life insurance policy. It’s almost like a hedge against disaster.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And it’s no skin off the back of bitcoin miners. Bitcoin has no uptime requirement, nor is the gear worn down by regularly powering off and on. It’s pretty much a win, win.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“That’s the beauty of bitcoin — it’s something no other industry can really do,” Arvanaghi told CNBC. “It’s very synergistic.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Not everyone agrees
Not all are convinced that bitcoin miners are the solution.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“Miners are a strain on the grid, not a help,” said Ben Hertz-Shargel of Wood Mackenzie, a provider of commercial intelligence for the world’s natural resources sector. Hertz-Shargel is concerned that bitcoin mining would only raise peak demand, ultimately adding stress to the system.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hertz-Shargel predicts that bitcoin could more than double demand growth in ERCOT’s territory, but unlike pro-crypto Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, Hertz-Shargel doesn’t think that additional demand is a good thing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;″The analogy I like to use is that if you start smoking two packs a day and then cut back to one pack on holidays, that doesn’t make smoking good for your health,” he says.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hertz-Shargel argues that ERCOT should be focused on grid improvements to make it easier to get power from solar and wind farms to big consumption centers, and that bitcoin miners aren’t the right way to deal with demand fluctuations. Instead, he argues, “the intermittency of renewables should be met with demand response from societally-beneficial loads, like industrial facilities, commercial buildings, and residential air conditioners — or energy storage.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But ERCOT interim CEO Brad Jones thinks bitcoin miners can be helpful.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Jones has been touring the state and hosting public events to answer questions from Texans about the electric grid. Besides winter weather, the impact of cryptocurrency mining on the grid is a common question.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“I’m pro bitcoin...but I’m too risk averse to be an investor in bitcoin,” Jones told a crowd of residents in Frisco, Texas in December. The ERCOT chief went on to explain the mutually beneficial relationship between the grid and bitcoin miners.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“A lot of these solar and wind can produce power down to a negative power range, negative $23 per megawatt hour,” Jones said. “These bitcoins see that as a great opportunity. They can get paid to use power. And that’s why they’re coming to the state. But that’s not necessarily bad.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Jones makes the point that negative power isn’t healthy for the market. Bitcoin miners “soak up” some of that negative power, and when the cost of electricity gets slightly higher than what they’re willing to pay for it (around $100, according to Jones), they shut off.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“So I think it’s really a valuable potential resource for us.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

Obviously, if you do not know how something works, you can&amp;amp;#39;t see potential in it in terms of what it can do. If you think the limits of NFTs are jpegs of monkeys or in-game upgrades and Bitcoin is just internet money which takes a lot of energy to move around, you do not understand why there is all the hype around them. It would of course look like a ponzi scheme to you.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Low intelligence, and the lack of understanding of the world around you and the way it works lends itself to conspiratorial thinking. This is found in &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psypost.org/2021/07/new-study-indicates-conspiracy-theory-believers-have-less-developed-critical-thinking-ability-61347&quot;&amp;gt;study after study&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. If things around you are confusing and you don&amp;amp;#39;t understand them, but it seems like at least &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;some&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; people understand them, of course you would think they are in cahoots. It&amp;amp;#39;s easier to say they must be in cahoots than to acknowledge your own intellectual failings. You are the dementia patient who won&amp;amp;#39;t admit or lacks the awareness to know that they are just forgetting where they put things, so you instead accuse everybody around you of stealing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the same way, lack of understanding about blockchain leads you to believe it&amp;amp;#39;s all a conspiracy, ponzi scheme, FOMO/hype nonsense, etc. Are there some conspiracies in the world? Of course. But is your average watcher of &amp;amp;quot;Ancient aliens&amp;amp;quot; or subscriber to the conspiracy subreddit the smartest duck in the room? No. The world is too complicated, and they seek a simple solution which makes them seem like they understand everything, they don&amp;amp;#39;t want to be somebody who is confused all the time, they just want the world to make sense, and conspiracy gives them a simple explanation that does, even if it seems fantastical to others. It&amp;amp;#39;s a very understandable human response to having too much information, and we all do it from time to time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;All the intelligent, well-spoken people I know who -- understand blockchain tech --have no problem thinking creatively about many, many use cases for it&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. People who are much smarter than me, who can explain what a zk-rollup is and why it matters. They may say that a lot of the NFT stuff is hype, or guardedly say that crypto can&amp;amp;#39;t solve everything, or that web3 has some kinks to work out, because of course it does, it is a new technology. Intelligent people &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;are not afraid of nuance and complexity&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; because they can keep track of it all. They don&amp;amp;#39;t jump to the conclusion that it&amp;amp;#39;s all or nothing, or that because they don&amp;amp;#39;t understand it, it must not have value. They aren&amp;amp;#39;t afraid to admit when they are wrong, or that their understanding may change in the future, they understand the world is not binary and that some things are complex enough that they lack the knowledge to fully understand them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto is the future. Tech geniuses see it. Major financial institutions see it. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Your friend who thinks crypto is a scam doesn&amp;amp;#39;t. And that&amp;amp;#39;s ok, they don&amp;amp;#39;t have to.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; They would have said the same thing about the internet, and they&amp;amp;#39;ll be using it in 20 years whether they&amp;amp;#39;re excited about it or not.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But if you really want to challenge them, ask questions. Ask them &amp;amp;quot;why?&amp;amp;quot; and you will quickly find they have no fucking idea what they are even talking about. So don&amp;amp;#39;t waste your time debating them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Shout out to Moxie for actually talking about how shit has just become super overcomplicated for coders to even begin to get into. This article is probably the best critique of the current crypto space I&amp;amp;#39;ve ever read ^&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We have these ideas of immutable, trustless, decentralized platforms but most of them have become mutable and centralized with all trust put in the hands of a few servers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cardano, for example, the fact that &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://cryptosrus.com/cardstarter-and-sundaeswap-a-falling-out-story/&quot;&amp;gt;sundaeswap took 6 months to release and it&amp;amp;#39;s not even fully ready yet&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; …&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://coin.fyi/news/cardano/cardstarter-and-every-single-project-it-has-launched-smells-of-a-scam-nmrfpt&quot;&amp;gt;plus looking like they rugged cardstarter&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, it’s not a good look!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Trustless&amp;amp;quot; doesn&amp;amp;#39;t make sense when there&amp;amp;#39;s still just a team of greedy humans on the other end of single phone line. I recall when my friends where first getting into crypto a few months ago, best believe it wasn&amp;amp;#39;t &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;‘for the tech’&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, it was pure greed, they were aping hundreds into doggy coins hoping to make millions out of thin air. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Arweave, which was made to solve the issue of NFTs being backed by on centralized servers, is still putting trust in the hands of others, so it&amp;amp;#39;s not exactly &amp;amp;quot;trustless&amp;amp;quot; and things can still be flagged for deletion and stuff like that. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.arweave.org/technology&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.arweave.org/technology&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;  = &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Finally, those that maintain gateways (the servers you will likely use to view the permaweb) can also apply content moderation policies to further safeguard their users.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s tricky though, like if you have permanent jpeg storage on a truly immutable permanent server what about criminal abuse material and other f’ed up stuff like that from being put on there ‘for good’? That&amp;amp;#39;s why Arweave has a democratic processes for removal of content if it&amp;amp;#39;s deemed necessary, but the problem is it&amp;amp;#39;s SLOW! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Just like Cardano, just like ETH, and Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and so on. All these truly decentralized things are slow as shit.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Compare the time it takes to load this:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://audius.co/neonanesthetics&quot;&amp;gt;https://audius.co/neonanesthetics&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;With this:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/artist/4h3dx3iH28dTFooTspQqxd&quot;&amp;gt;https://open.spotify.com/artist/4h3dx3iH28dTFooTspQqxd&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This just really highlights the sheer magnitude of the blockchain trilemma: &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Low Cost, Speed, Decentralization. Pick 2.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I still believe in crypto, but if this doesn&amp;amp;#39;t make you think...I&amp;amp;#39;ve always said there will probably be a dominant cryptocurrency in the future that solves all of these issues, but less and less am I thinking it will be any networks available today. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It will likely be built upon 6G network protocols, or some similar competing concept; 6G will basically mishmash the current 5G super-speed, satellite based internet, to that of the internet of things, peer2peer data transfer, and blockchain(s). &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here&amp;amp;#39;s a journal article from last summer: &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Blockchain and 6G: The Future of Secure and Ubiquitous Communication&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.05673.pdf&quot;&amp;gt;https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.05673.pdf&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;  = &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;the trustless nature of blockchain would make it easier to manage and audit 3D network resources and AI model parameters in 6G networks.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Another example, in Windows update there&amp;amp;#39;s this:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/jfd16glvkzf81.png?width=732&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=8119e238830ba28eba85c150763a516e13c85373&quot;&amp;gt;Microsoft Windows Update Delivery Optimization&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now extrapolate that concept out to creating the blockchain and the internet itself, not just simple data transfer - it&amp;amp;#39;ll be a mix of current cell-tower tech sped up a thousand-fold by decentralizing server loads through peer2peer means, encrypted, and under consensus - all while having latency speeds measured in single digit milliseconds!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here is a latency test of my internet to google: Top is with VPN routed through Portugal : Bottom is without VPN.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/szcppeg2lzf81.png?width=722&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=4ae7a88e08ba577ff67785c362d5beba976f4b17&quot;&amp;gt;Ping Command to Test Your Network&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We need speeds 1 order of magnitude faster than the current best case scenario technologies, and 2 orders of magnitude faster than what&amp;amp;#39;s the more &amp;amp;quot;practical&amp;amp;quot; speeds we&amp;amp;#39;re used to. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To conclude this spiel, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;I think we&amp;amp;#39;re about a decade away from this all.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Till then, I am still having fun learning about money, economics, fiancé, decentralization issues, network effects, but less and less am I feeling married to any single current network/blockchain because they all seem to be unable to carry the load that will weigh on future technological shoulders.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Don&amp;amp;#39;t forget we are still in a downtrend, and history shows that pumps can disappear as fast as they appeared. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So don&amp;amp;#39;t make any reckless decisions, stick to the plans you made before this pump, and calm down a bit. You&amp;amp;#39;ll do better if you stay humble and keep a level head on yourself. Cheers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Market kept going down so I kept posting collateral as needed to keep the loan healthy.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I got an email saying that the loan was being called back because of &amp;amp;quot;indirect exposure to a mixing service&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I appealed the decision because I bought the BTC back in May of 2020 and kept it on my Trezor the entire time. However, since I didn&amp;amp;#39;t buy it on an exchange and the person before me mixed it (BISQ) I get absolutely screwed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In summary I took out a loan when BTC was 65,000, Cost me over $6000 in origination fees, paid two months of loan payments ($2500+), got liquidated at $37,000 a few MINUTES before a pump to $42,000 today because of &amp;amp;quot;indirect mixing exposure&amp;amp;quot; and now I lost more than half of my BTC holdings, have a huge tax bill, and was screwed out of a fortune.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;DO NOT USE BLOCKFI LOANS. Worst experience I have ever had in Bitcoin&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;EDIT: Since everybody keeps saying &amp;amp;quot;Dont take loans to buy crypto&amp;amp;quot; I am adding this comment to the main post&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;My bank did not consider BTC as an asset. I took out the loan with the intention of showing the balance in my bank account so I can get the mortgage and was planning on paying off the loans to get my BTC back.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Didnt work out......&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;EDIT 2: Most importantly the main problem for me was the P2P nature of the transaction. They literally do not allow you to buy your BTC from any private source that does not perform KYC. This is the biggest piece of fuckery of the entire situation that people need to pay very close attention to. I didnt, and it cost me 100s of thousands&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
