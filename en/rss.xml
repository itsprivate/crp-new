&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Here is what can do (translated from btc-echo.de):&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;For this reason, we are publishing a collected list with all the email addresses of the MEPs who will vote on Monday.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;This includes those from the liberal and Christian Democratic camps who oppose a Bitcoin ban as well as Greens, Leftists and Social Democrats who have submitted the aforementioned amendments.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;So anyone who likes can make use of their democratic right and formulate their objections constructively.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;1/ rooting for crypto as an investment that can buy you financial independence through fast paced growth. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;2/ rooting for crypto as a form of payment used in everyday life. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I understand that the intended purpose of crypto is closer to 2/, but unless it finds ways to firmly stabilize its value, I don’t think it can ever really succeed. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;1/ implies taxable events, holding, and risk. Using my crypto to pay for something leads me to tax exposure, potentially liquidating assets at the wrong time, and reducing potential future gains in the good times. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There is a reason we don’t pay for everyday things in stocks. We may reward them in shares (eg RSUs), but nobody treats stocks as a method of payment because it belongs in the investment assets class.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;From this POV, how can anyone say they want what behaves like an investment asset with limited supply to serve as a currency?  Shouldn’t the valuation (and supply) of each token aim to be a lot more stable than what most projects offer?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: some people are pointing out the existence of stable coins - I know, and that’s kind of the point. I’m puzzled by the constant celebration of non stablecoins being accepted as payment. I think paying for your latte with ETH is what makes zero sense (unless you’re an absolutist).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

After an exciting year in 2021, the cryptocurrency space is becoming a ghost town, like the elders from 2017 prophesied. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I am not just talking about prices, which has been depressed for a few weeks now ; the hype surrounding our ecosystem is fading. Google Trends clearly shows that searches for terms like &amp;amp;quot;bitcoin&amp;amp;quot;, &amp;amp;quot;NFT&amp;amp;quot; and &amp;amp;quot;crypto&amp;amp;quot; are at their lowest level since summer, and the activity on this sub has been falling off a cliff. The Daily barely have 2k comments...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But here&amp;amp;#39;s the deal : &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;I am convinced that, in a few years, people will look at that slump as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; If you are still holding, or even better, DCAing, you&amp;amp;#39;re gonna make it. Well, probably.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Every single person that was there in 2017 told me the same thing : those who bought and hold during the brutal bear market made insane amount of money when the bull came back. And, from a long-term perspective, there is a lot of reasons to be bullish. Ethereum will finally switch to proof-of-stake in about three months, Bitcoin has been hold surprisingly well against growth/tech stocks, a lot of new protocols are being worked on/launched, Biden basically told us last week the US will regulate - but not ban - cryptocurrencies...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Could the prices get lower in the next few weeks? Absolutely. Inflation, war, recession : it&amp;amp;#39;s possible that we drill further down. But if you hold through this tumultuous period, you will emerge on the other side wealthier.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is in moments like these that characters are forged. I hope that in ten years you can look back on this time and be proud that you stayed true to your convictions!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

And they say other stuff like: &amp;amp;quot;Time in the market beats timing the market.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Well, if that is true, you still want to lump sum,  so that you have as much time as possible in the market. On average, for Bitcoin, you want to buy as early as possible. And with DCA you don&amp;amp;#39;t buy as early as possible.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then you have to consider, if DCA were such an amazing strategy, then everyone on Reddit should be really rich by now. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;But DCA&amp;amp;#39;ing during the bull market only makes your average cost higher.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But don&amp;amp;#39;t take it up with me, take it up with the data:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I expect that everyone will disagree with this post, because all Reddit can say is &amp;amp;quot;DCA and hold&amp;amp;quot;, but that&amp;amp;#39;s whatever. If it works for you, it&amp;amp;#39;s fine.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Just know that you underperform everyone who just invests as much as possible as early as possible.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When I logged into my account after placing these low bids on the market a while back, I was amazed to see I had amassed 632,151 XRP tokens.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here’s the heart-breaking bit. I naturally was mind-blown, so I tried to sell some of the XRP in the account then withdraw my profits from the exchange elsewhere, only to have the withdrawal declined and my account temporarily closed for 1 day siting a ‘violation of our terms of use’. I have done nothing wrong and simply set low limit orders that were filled.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I contacted support asking why this has happened, they didn’t tell me why my account was restricted or what terms of use I had broken. After the 24 hours my account is back up, all the XRP is gone and I’m left with the cryptocurrency I had originally. I contact support again asking for my coins back, I get vague responses not related to the issue.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Considering this is topic about his personal life, 15 years ago.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s baffling how fast this sub was ready to label the dude as a pathological liar.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Solana team was caught lying about the amount of token supply, but I guess THAT&amp;amp;#39;S not a problem....when this thing doesn&amp;amp;#39;t really have direct relevance to Cardano as a blockchain to begin with.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Why all the constant tribalism, misinformation gets upvoted to the top? Why people are so quick to believe their own bias and take slanderous claims as facts? How did Hoskinson hurt you?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Welcome to modern-day &amp;amp;quot;journalism&amp;amp;quot;, where if you&amp;amp;#39;re unfortunate enough to be relevant, you get thrown into situations where you must spend hours of your day to pull out decade-old paperwork to address whatever accusations these leeches throw at you. If you fail to do so you get canceled, if you decide to waste your time and do pull out the paperwork, those leeches won&amp;amp;#39;t even issue an apology and they still get the clickbait that they wanted.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For people wanting details about his degree, here ya go &amp;amp;quot;At 18 an AS from front range community College in 2005. &amp;amp;quot; - &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1502097939669434378?s=20&amp;amp;amp;t=1zqxKMiXKZcYZQS9pzw6Wg&quot;&amp;gt;https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1502097939669434378?s=20&amp;amp;amp;t=1zqxKMiXKZcYZQS9pzw6Wg&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit:
Okay. People have mentioned that Solana thing was widely discussed here. I admit I based this assumption on few comments by people who were shitting on Hoskinson while seemingly being all fine with Solana. In retrospect, I shouldn&amp;amp;#39;t have said anything about Solana. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But my point was, that lies about the total supply of tokens is something that is directly related to the blockchain of Sol, while this case doesn&amp;amp;#39;t have much to do with Cardano.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However, I understand that I&amp;amp;#39;m coming off as hypocritical here myself. And I&amp;amp;#39;m sorry for that. But I just wanted to put these things into perspective when it comes to this cancel culture of this sub.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Help me understand why I&amp;amp;#39;m wrong... Or confirm my concerns.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here&amp;amp;#39;s the problem I have with Terra:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Assume I own the entirety of Terra at the start and there are only UST Terra.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Suppose 1 Luna = 1 USD and there are 2 Luna in existence.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Suppose 1 UST = 1.01 USD and there is 1 UST in existence.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My Terra+Luna+usd universe is worth $3.01.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now suppose to peg UST, I burn 1 Luna and mint 1 UST and sell it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I get:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;1 Luna &amp;amp;gt; 1 USD (it&amp;amp;#39;s claimed, since supply went down)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;1 UST = 1 USD&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;1.01 USD&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The total value of my universe must now be worth &amp;amp;gt;$3.01, if the claim that the value of Luna rises is true.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;All I did was sell a token for the price it was worth, and suddenly it&amp;amp;#39;s claimed that the net worth of my universe is now  greater than it was.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It makes no sense to me that minting a UST token by moving value from one pool to another should yield created value in the pool that had value &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;taken from it&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This smells to me of a complicated, well obsfucated, ponzi scheme.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The more UST you mint, the less Luna there is. The drop in total minted Luna makes people *think* Luna should be worth more, so they buy it.  In reality the total network includes both Luna AND Terra and the value of Luna shouldn&amp;amp;#39;t have changed at all.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But go the other way: when people start selling their UST because they want to go back to bitcoin, they mint Luna and sell it. Now the price of Luna goes down. The fact that the price is going down and total coins minted is rising encourages the selling of Luna making the price drop farther. If the price drops too far, it can no longer support the burning of UST to get a dollar by selling Luna.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As far as I can tell, buyers of Luna are basically the pansies that are paying for the exit of UST bag holders.  Once people don&amp;amp;#39;t want to buy Luna, any remaining Luna and UST holders are screwed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It seems to be that as fast as Luna is rising, that&amp;amp;#39;s how fast it can fall.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Explain to me how this isn&amp;amp;#39;t true.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

(I keep the majority of my coins in my own wallet, but I had a small purchase I didn’t bother moving). Coinbase did offer 4% previously, but they have dramatically reduced the rewards. I just received this email. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We want to inform you about a recent change in your ALGO rewards that you might have noticed. With the transition of Algorand from a participation to governance model, the rewards rate has dropped significantly from 4% to 0.45%  as of March 8, 2022. We anticipate that you will see more fluctuations during the transitionary period.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Coinbase continues to participate in governance on your behalf and you are likely to see more governance rewards paid out in the future. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Algorand publishes regular updates on how it calculates rewards on its own website.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I have a strong feeling someone at Coinbase missed the vote and now Coinbase won’t get paid, despite them saying they continue to participate in governance. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I see two huge problems. One is governance rewards are 6-7% APY, meaning CB is collecting over 90% of the rewards they receive, and users get peanuts. Additionally, Coinbase inevitably will vote for what’s best for Coinbase, not necessarily what’s best for Algorand. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you have any ALGO sitting on Coinbase (or any exchange for that matter), I urge you to move them off the exchange and into your own wallet (MyALGO or Algorand Wallet) so you can participate in governance and get your due rewards!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: Thanks to the commenters- the official Algorand Wallet has rebranded to Pera. I use MyAlgo and forgot this change happened. Apologies for the mistake&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

About half the coins performed better than BTC since then. It&amp;amp;#39;s fine to mostly hold BTC and ETH, but this is not a reason to do so.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A year ago, the marked looked pretty great. Almost everything had been almost exclusively going up for a year, especially since November 2020. BTC was at 56k, higher than it had ever been before, and would soon reach over 60k.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Today, the situation is more complicated. The market in general has been going up and down a &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;lot&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; in the past year. Currently, the sentiment on here seems rather bearish, so I was curious: if we don&amp;amp;#39;t just look at BTC but the general market, how much worse, if at all, does the situation look today? If someone started their crypto journey a year ago today and bought a coin, how likely is it they made a profit?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So I scraped historical data from a year ago today from Coinmarketcap and today&amp;amp;#39;s prices. I looked at all coins that were in the top 200 a year ago and checked how many of them are up and how many of them are down.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There were 8 stablecoins in the top 200 back then, which of course did not really go up or down, so there are 192 remaining. Of these, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;48 (25%) increased in price since then&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. LUNA (+756%), SOL (+481%), MATIC (+397%) and MANA (+395%) performed the best since then. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;22 coins (11%) at least doubled in this time frame.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On the other hand, of course, that means &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;144 (75%) of all coins in the top 200 back then lost value. 83 (43%) of all coins lost more than half of their value and 35 (18%) lost more than 70%&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. That&amp;amp;#39;s not looking too great. The coins that performed the worst are CyberVein (-98%), ZKSpace (-96%) and  Bitcoin Standard Hashrate Token (-95%) - and I have never heard of either of them. From the slightly better known coins, the top losers are NEM, The Graph (both -84%) and SushiSwap (-83%). As a GRT hodler that hurts, even though I&amp;amp;#39;m still up from the price I bought.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;What does all of this mean? Well, not that much, but I guess it&amp;amp;#39;s obvious that, for the first time in a while, we are pretty obviously in a downward trend and have been for a while.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Some would argue it is definitely a bear market (and using a &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearmarket.asp&quot;&amp;gt;classic definition from other markets&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; we absolutely are), some would probably define everything that isn&amp;amp;#39;t a negative trend for multiple years, like 2018-2020, just temporary and not a real bear market. I have absolutely no idea what will happen next - crash, crabbing along or start of the next crazy bull run - but I thought this might interest some of you as well.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At some point in time, Cardano was 3rd place in market capitalization behind Ethereum and Bitcoin, yet it still didn’t even have smart contracts compared to Ethereum which already had them perfected a long beforehand.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I like Cardano a lot don’t get me wrong, butI just feel like they’re very slow with development especially compared to other chains like Polygon for example.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If anything, Polygon is WAY younger than Cardano yet it still managed to get 7000+ fully functioning dApps on board a lot of which are of very high quality actually. And quiet honestly, I think a project like Polygon is more deserving of slot at the top.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cardano has &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;A LOT&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; of potential if only they improve their development timing. But for the current performance, I just think they’re very overhyped. That’s just my personal take though.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
