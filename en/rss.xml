&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s been said here before, but Solana is a scam: I knew it from the second I heard the CEO of the development company describe the &amp;amp;quot;network switch model&amp;amp;quot; of &amp;amp;quot;doing one thing (high scalability and throughput for dApps) and doing it well&amp;amp;quot;. Here&amp;amp;#39;s my reasoning:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I work in the tech industry, and I can show you a ledger that can scale faster and for cheaper than Solana right now. Moreover, it&amp;amp;#39;s more stable and you&amp;amp;#39;ll have next to no problems using it b/c &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;the underlying tech has already been in use since the &amp;amp;#39;70s&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;... It&amp;amp;#39;s called a SQL database. It can handle millions of TPS even without complex scaling schemes, and it gets faster as you add more machines to it. You can run pretty much any financial application you want on top of it with no problems b/c, in fact, &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;all of traditional finance is already built on top of it&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;. Instead of using a complex language like Solidity or Rust, devs can literally use JavaScript. You can even log into it with your Facebook account!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The problem is: What I&amp;amp;#39;m describing is 100% centralized. In fact, it&amp;amp;#39;s literally the technical foundation for all centralization of data; it&amp;amp;#39;s the bookkeeping layer behind the billions and trillions of dollars that the banks and big tech are screwing people out of every day (the &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;settlement layer&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, if you will).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The point I&amp;amp;#39;m getting at is that: &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;If you have a ledger that can be rolled back at the discretion of a central group of authorities, then it&amp;amp;#39;s literally a glorified database being run by a glorified bank.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; If you have no problem with this, then you&amp;amp;#39;re in crypto for the wrong reasons; therefore, I suggest it&amp;amp;#39;s time to reexamine things.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

It is a good price if you have your own money to invest, borrowing money from a bank to invest in crypto even if it&amp;amp;#39;s low APR% it&amp;amp;#39;s not advisable and you shouldn&amp;amp;#39;t do it. Losing your own money might sound bad, but imagine you&amp;amp;#39;ve lost borrowed money, which you&amp;amp;#39;ll have to pay back eventually. A simple quote that everybody heard a dozen times; don&amp;amp;#39;t invest what you can&amp;amp;#39;t afford to lose. Seems to me people still don&amp;amp;#39;t get the principle of it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can play around with your own money, nobody gives a f, if you lose it. Playing with borrowed money, not so much, it can f**k up your life in a variety of ways. You&amp;amp;#39;ll owe more money in penalties, interest charges will get higher and your credit score will fall as well, not to mention mental problems that could come along the way.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With that being said, if you took a loan to invest in crypto, I wish you the best, also we&amp;amp;#39;re looking forward to seeing your results, and I hope everything turns out well for you.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There are explicit taxes that impact me and my earning potential such as income taxes, property taxes, sales taxes, payroll taxes, state and local taxes. There are also implicit taxes that affect me in ways that are a bit more difficult to quantify like inflation (an invisible tax that diminishes the purchasing power for the dollars I keep) and corporate taxes (revenue that could have all or in part gone into employee salaries). &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Months prior I listened to a podcast with Robert Breedlove where he discussed the idea that one’s effective tax rate is a representation of how much a slave one is to the state. A statement I felt was bold, but the argument was interesting: what is slavery if not a 100% tax on your time and energy? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I decided to take the challenge and determine how much a &amp;amp;quot;slave&amp;amp;quot; I really am. I reviewed my paycheck, my property tax bill, my monthly purchases and my state tax rate. The result surprised me to say the least. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here are the numbers represented as a percentage of my gross income: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Federal Income Tax: 26.16% &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;State Income Tax: 10.66% &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Medicare Tax: 2.16% &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Disability Tax: 1.64% &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Social Security Tax: 9.25% &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Property Tax: 4.94% &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Monthly Expense Sales Tax (@ 7.75% rate): 2.71% &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Total Tax: 57.52%&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And that’s just explicit taxes. The latest Consumer Price Inflation print for June 2022 was 8.6%. Simply adding the CPI figure into the sum puts me at a 66.12% total tax rate. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For every 3 hours of work, the value created by 2 is taken from me and given to the government. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I am 66% slave. How about you?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The crypto market is crashing because of interest rate hikes (because debt becomes more expensive and people suddenly wants less of it). Inflation is not dealt with yet and we&amp;amp;#39;ll see more rate hikes. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Worst case scenario is a global housing crash and financial meltdown. Crypto has never seen that before, but we can be pretty sure it won&amp;amp;#39;t thrive in those conditions either.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Don&amp;amp;#39;t buy crypto now unless you&amp;amp;#39;ve got money to spare and you are prepared to hold for several years. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Save some money for your debt, or to buy into housing if that market crashes too.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: There seem to be some confusion about what my &amp;amp;quot;advice&amp;amp;quot; really is. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m not saying that crypto will definitely keep declining, although it&amp;amp;#39;s likely, but rather that there is an alternative cost to your investments as the interest rates increases. It never hurts to have a liquid buffer when there&amp;amp;#39;s hard times ahead, and your indirect profits from paying off a 4% mortgage could potentially be higher than profits from crypto investments made now.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I haven&amp;amp;#39;t sold any of my Bitcoin during this crypto-crash. I even bought more. Bitcoin is not about buying it for low today and selling it high tomorrow. It is about its technology and decentralization and having an opportunity to truly and fully own it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And a lot of time will pass until most people see Bitcoin as a way to fight the financial system, banks and government.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Currently, Tether sits at a market cap of &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;$68 billion&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; at spot #3 and USDC coin sits at &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;$55 billion&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; at spot #4.  So USDC coin is within roughly &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$13 billion&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; away from unseating it!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With all the uncertainty and misery right now, the last thing we would need is a total Tether collapse, so it’s terrific to see USDC more widely utilized. Hopefully we can have a smooth fade away from Tether, rather than a “rip the bandaid” period that could be much more destructive to the crypto environment.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Just some good news for you in a sea of red 😅&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When you watch your portfolio drop past 50 percent it has an affect on you. I&amp;amp;#39;m at the stage where I&amp;amp;#39;ve accepted that this was meant to happen as a learning experience but it also solidified my determination for long term savings. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I imagined anyone in the world being able to have a crypto bank account. No monthly fees, no depending on if the bank wants you or not, no paperwork requirements, no paying for bundle of services that you will never use, no predatory credit practices and so many other benefits.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I imagined people being able to transfer money with no boundaries. International money transfers can be such a pain in the ass and there all sorts of fees and random entities you have to trust in order to do it. Even if the money is yours you need a bank account in both countries.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I imagined people in countries with high inflation being able to have money that is stable and detached from the craziness in their countries. Venezuela comes to mind.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I wish there existed some coin with some built in mechanism that discouraged speculation so the price would be more stable and poor people could put their money on it without the risk of all the price fluctuations.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyway, what other real life uses you see for Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I&amp;amp;#39;ve seen the ups and downs and rode the rollercoaster all this time.  This crash has me a little bit spooked though, I will admit.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitcoin was made to have strong and incorruptible monetary policy, in the face of easy money.  With the way things are going, it seems like we&amp;amp;#39;re seeing things unravel in the global economy pretty much as Bitcoiners have been predicting since the beginning.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And yet the price of Bitcoin takes a massive shit as this drama unfolds, and we&amp;amp;#39;re all wondering where the bottom is, if it can be found at all.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s as if you have Rocky training for years and years for the big fight, endless montage, he&amp;amp;#39;s fucking shredded and ready to rumble.  But when he gets in the ring, he shits his pants and cries.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It just seems like these are the conditions that we&amp;amp;#39;ve all been preparing for, but it&amp;amp;#39;s just not going well so far.  We put our money into Bitcoin to have strength in the face of a financial downturn, but if you are holding Bitcoin right now, it&amp;amp;#39;s hard to find other investments that have been hit harder.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I guess this is my whiny panic post.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Let me repeat: &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;it&amp;amp;#39;s not just crypto that&amp;amp;#39;s tanking&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. Everything is tanking. And I do mean &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;everything&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Stocks are now officially in a &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/glossary/bear-market&quot;&amp;gt;bear market&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; with no bottom in sight as it falls below the 20% &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/finance/quote/.INX:INDEXSP?window=YTD&quot;&amp;gt;threshold&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;High yield investment grade bonds are &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/finance/quote/HYG:NYSEARCA?window=YTD&quot;&amp;gt;collapsing&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, also with no end in sight. (Yes, 15% is a collapse in bond terms).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Even safe assets like 7-10 year treasuries are &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/finance/quote/IEF:NASDAQ?window=YTD&quot;&amp;gt;sinking&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; as well. My bond bros can back me up. A 12% drop in a &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;fixed&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; income ETF? That&amp;amp;#39;s really, really bad.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;National currencies like the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ifcmarkets.com/en/market-data/personal-instrument-pci-prices/jpy-index&quot;&amp;gt;Yen&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; aren&amp;amp;#39;t safe either.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Real estate and gold are the last legs to fall. Why are they last? Liquidity. Gold doesn&amp;amp;#39;t move very often and real estate tends to lag other assets due to its lengthier acquisition process. But we&amp;amp;#39;re already seeing signs that &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/finance/quote/VNQ:NYSEARCA?window=YTD&quot;&amp;gt;real estate&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; is going to tank.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;only&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; safe place to be is cold hard &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/dxy&quot;&amp;gt;United States Dollar&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Cash&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; is going to be &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;king&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; for the foreseeable future and I don&amp;amp;#39;t anticipate that changing anytime soon. So if you&amp;amp;#39;re living outside America, I feel sorry for you, I really do. I have no advice other than try to get more $USD. For those in the States, here&amp;amp;#39;s what you should be doing going forward:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Don&amp;amp;#39;t&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; over leverage. That means don&amp;amp;#39;t borrow money, don&amp;amp;#39;t mortgage your house, and don&amp;amp;#39;t max out your credit cards if you can help it.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Do&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; cut spending and save as much cash as possible.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Don&amp;amp;#39;t&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; buy the dip. It&amp;amp;#39;s not a dip, it&amp;amp;#39;s a falling knife.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Do&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; re-evaluation your allocation. I&amp;amp;#39;ve put 10% of my net worth into crypto and it&amp;amp;#39;s now sitting at 5%. I don&amp;amp;#39;t plan on re-allocating back to 10% because I was clearly over-exposed. I&amp;amp;#39;m going to camp at 5% and see what happens next. I&amp;amp;#39;ll be moving the other 5% into cash.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Don&amp;amp;#39;t&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; panic sell. The time for selling has long passed. You lost that opportunity when BTC was at $40k. Now you fucking HODL.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Do&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; stay the course. Whatever your investment strategy was, make sure to re-assess and keep investing. Slowly and deliberately.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Don&amp;amp;#39;t&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; try to time the market. You can&amp;amp;#39;t. If you didn&amp;amp;#39;t sell at the top, then you sure as shit aren&amp;amp;#39;t buying at the bottom.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Do&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; diversify going forward. There is no such thing as a &amp;amp;quot;guarantee&amp;amp;quot; in investing and there is no one &amp;amp;quot;true&amp;amp;quot; asset. Otherwise, we&amp;amp;#39;d all be holding that one asset. All investments have risks of going to 0, never think otherwise.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Don&amp;amp;#39;t&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; beat yourself up. The bears are out in the woods today for a picnic and they&amp;amp;#39;ll be relentlessly mocking you. Every bear will suddenly be an expert who &amp;amp;quot;saw all this coming&amp;amp;quot; and they&amp;amp;#39;ll say that you were a fool to invest in &amp;amp;quot;tulip bulbs&amp;amp;quot;. Unless those bears actually made money from this crash, they&amp;amp;#39;re just shit talking cowards.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There&amp;amp;#39;s more pain to come, folks. Much more. We&amp;amp;#39;re nowhere near max pain, so don&amp;amp;#39;t get brave yet. Bitcoin is an asset like any other. Don&amp;amp;#39;t fall in love with it, don&amp;amp;#39;t feel emotional about it. If it&amp;amp;#39;s keeping you up at night, maybe consider trimming it. Thanks for listening to my Ted Talk.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thousands of new investors who entered the market in the 2025 bull run are googling the word &amp;amp;quot;capitulation&amp;amp;quot; for the first time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Elon Musk has announced he&amp;amp;#39;s running for president as a Republican in 2028, and has a pro crypto platform. Despite falling over 90% from its ATH, Elon continues to shill Dogecoin as a valid form of currency. His tweets no longer seem to have an effect on the price of Dogecoin as most investors now see his long lived obsession as being out of touch.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Centralized exchanges now only able to offer rates around 1 - 2% after all the SEC regulations that were put in place to protect consumers after the 2022 crash. This still attracts new investors looking to make some passive income on their bitcoin, despite the recommendation of seasoned crypto holders still bitter about having their funds frozen by Celsius.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The top posts on &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/cc&quot;&amp;gt;r/cc&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; are mostly meta posts about the community, criticizing other posts and judging perceived sentiment from members of the community. People will comment &amp;amp;quot;I bought bitcoin at 40K in 2022 and I&amp;amp;#39;m doing fine&amp;amp;quot;. Others will reply &amp;amp;quot;Wow, you have a lot of willpower not selling at 350K&amp;amp;quot;. For some this is true, and for others they just did a poor job taking profits and are content to wait it out until the next bull run.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;At least I learned some important lessons&amp;amp;quot;. They tell themselves. &amp;amp;quot;I&amp;amp;#39;ll change my strategy and do better next time&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;About 10 hours ago, CeIsius deposits 12 million DAI in the Maker contract and retrieves 6.7M LINK tokens.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fair enough, they are paying off an outstanding debt on Maker. To be expected if they were winding down and retrieving their users&amp;amp;#39; funds for  withdrawal.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But then they send it through a few wallets:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://etherscan.io/token/0x514910771af9ca656af840dff83e8264ecf986ca?a=0x41318419cfa25396b47a94896ffa2c77c6434040&quot;&amp;gt;https://etherscan.io/token/0x514910771af9ca656af840dff83e8264ecf986ca?a=0x41318419cfa25396b47a94896ffa2c77c6434040&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://etherscan.io/token/0x514910771af9ca656af840dff83e8264ecf986ca?a=0x019c4935ff1c4945f046c6784c08a40f1ab632a3&quot;&amp;gt;https://etherscan.io/token/0x514910771af9ca656af840dff83e8264ecf986ca?a=0x019c4935ff1c4945f046c6784c08a40f1ab632a3&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://etherscan.io/token/0x514910771af9ca656af840dff83e8264ecf986ca?a=0x76a05277b81b9ca6c06c9ab4136116fc53e9c9e1&quot;&amp;gt;https://etherscan.io/token/0x514910771af9ca656af840dff83e8264ecf986ca?a=0x76a05277b81b9ca6c06c9ab4136116fc53e9c9e1&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And where is this $40M in Chainlink sent? Surely, back to the CeIsius wallets so the users can withdraw their funds, right? No.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They sent it to FTX.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;CeIsius has learned nothing. They are not unwinding. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;They  are speculating with their users&amp;amp;#39; deposits by openly shorting what  their own users have deposited with them, on the open market.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Okex&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Nexo&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; are doing exactly the same.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

This alone accounts for a huge % of borrowing on Solana, and now this position is under a liquidation threat. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The whale is not closing their position. In most protocols like Compound, or AAVE, Maker etc, this will result in an onchain liquidation. Infact we have seen many such large liquidations on AAVE And Maker recently, and everything has worked as expected. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However such a large liquidation in an illiquid market and unstable network like Solana is likely to have vastly damaging consequences. Solana network has already gone down and halted half a dozen time. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Solend team explains what could happen to the network:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This  could cause chaos, putting a strain on the Solana network. Liquidators  would be especially active and spamming the liquidate function, which  has been known to be a factor causing Solana to go down in the past.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Letting a liquidation of this size to happen on-chain is extremely risky.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;  DEX liquidity isn’t deep enough to handle a sale of this size and could  cause cascading effects. Additionally, liquidators will be incentivized  to spam the network in an effort to win very lucrative liquidations.  This has been known to cause load issues for Solana in the past which  would exacerbate the problems at hand.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So to prevent this, they are proposing to literally steal the user&amp;amp;#39;s funds and execute OTC trades:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Grant  emergency power to Solend Labs to temporarily take over the whale’s  account so the liquidation can be executed OTC and avoid pushing Solana  to its limits. This would be done via a smart contract upgrade.  Emergency powers will be revoked once the whale’s account reaches a safe  level.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When shit starts to implode, all the true colors of decentralization comes out. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These shitty protocol are run by fly by night cowboys who learnt basics of economics during the bull run. They put their users are risk by running terrible protocols that do not think about all the edge cases...because who cares about risks right?! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And during signs of distress, they resolve to seize user funds.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Everyone has essentially written it off as something between gambling and a scam, with phrases like “greater fools” echoing from thread to thread. There isn’t even a hint of rhetoric resembling open discourse about the crypto space in the comments.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I’m wondering how we arrived at such a divisive place, if we should be worried that the rhetoric is becoming overwhelmingly negative and polarized, and if Reddit is analogous main stream sentiment. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Part of what gives anything value is the belief that it has value. As amazing as the theory and tech side of crypto is, with its potential to revolutionize and disrupt archaic systems, if people simply emotionally decide it’s worthless, then it could become a self fulfilling prophecy of sorts.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Curious what this community thinks about this.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Fair enough, that&amp;amp;#39;s usually the case.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But combined with this relative &amp;amp;quot;calm&amp;amp;quot; amongst people in the crypto sphere as of yet, what we&amp;amp;#39;re also seeing is altcoins holding the line in an unprecedented way. I thought it was just a few coins like LINK and ADA who were doing well. But I was just made aware of the fact that out of the top 100 on CMC, only 10 and 5 coins have &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;worse&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; performing 7-day metrics than BTC and ETH respectively. Yes, you read that right. In this gigantic downturn, when BTC just broke it&amp;amp;#39;s previous ATH which has never happened before, a time when there should be absolute doubt and panic, only 10 (!!!) coins have a worse 7-day performance than btc. This is unprecedented.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What I&amp;amp;#39;m also reading a lot of, and a good point someone else made whose name I forgot, is that BTC and ETH are crashing because that&amp;amp;#39;s where all the liquidations happen.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I don&amp;amp;#39;t know about you, but BTC could drop another 70%, and so could all my alts, but the time for selling has been long gone, and in fact, even if BTC dropped another 70%, I would be buying. Not BTC, but more alts. Because the ones I have, I have no doubt about their future, so why wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t I? Fucking bargain! It&amp;amp;#39;s kinda funny because earlier I actually caught myself being irritated at LINK because it wasn&amp;amp;#39;t dropping as hard as BTC, preventing me to scoop them up cheaper.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My point is, this crash doesn&amp;amp;#39;t seem to be caused by doubtful panic like all the times before. We know what we have. And we&amp;amp;#39;re not going to part with it. And given all this I just don&amp;amp;#39;t feel that the thesis, that we need this whole sub to panic in order to find a bottom, to hold this time around. I&amp;amp;#39;ve been here  since 2013 (I know, anecdotal), but something feels different. I don&amp;amp;#39;t see myself suddenly start panicking if btc drops another 50%, you? The doubt and fear that we had all previous crashes is pretty much gone. This is just shitty liquidations happening, and who knows when they might stop.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now of course, naysayers might say that this very post is proof of the fact that we&amp;amp;#39;re not near a bottom yet. Fair enough. But that doesn&amp;amp;#39;t change the very different situation we seem to find ourselves in as described above this time around.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I’m not planning on getting out but I’ve learned some hard lessons like take profits on your alts and don’t get greedy. And also never be married to a position.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
