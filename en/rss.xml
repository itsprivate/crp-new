&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hah, just kidding. But it&amp;amp;#39;s not &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;too&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; far off from the mark.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Safemoon was released on the 2nd March 2021, after core developer &amp;amp;quot;Safemoondev&amp;amp;quot; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://editor.mergely.com/tNAqXd2g/&quot;&amp;gt;copy-pasted the BEE contract line for line, changing the overall tax from 5% to 10%&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Safemoon to this day claim there was a &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;fair launch&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, however in reality, Safemoon launched with zero announcements on March 2nd 2021, where immediately, several wallets purchased hundreds and thousands of dollars worth of a token listed at less than $0.00000000002 (10 zeroes, meaning one hundred bucks would buy you 5 Trillion Tokens &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;This price is correct as of March 5th, I have no earlier price entries&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;). &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Public availability was then on the 8th March, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://currency.com/safemoon-price-prediction&quot;&amp;gt;where the token price had already raised significantly to $0.000000001&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. At this point, new entrants were still getting billions of tokens for relatively small sums, but of course, the people selling got very lucky - these original wallets are widely speculated to be Developers &amp;amp;amp; Friends/Family of developers, with investigation to confirm proof of this currently underway. Whoever bought between March 2nd and March 8th could&amp;amp;#39;ve earned up to 4,900%&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Safemoon enlists the help of several prominent influencers to keep the volume high and price pumping. Names such as Soulja Boy, Jake Paul, etc. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/safemoon-price-plunges-in-response-to-class-action-lawsuit-against-jake-paul-nick-carter-and-souja-boy-202202220843&quot;&amp;gt;There is currently an ongoing Class-Action lawsuit alleging these influencers, and Safemoon dev team pumped and dumped Safemoon&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;An &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://i.redd.it/invnefpcizq61.png&quot;&amp;gt;original roadmap is published&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. This lays out a year&amp;amp;#39;s worth of activity. To this day, most items have been abandoned, or were released months late.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In May 2021, Safemoon reaches the All-Time-High of $0.00001094. If any Pre &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;fair-launch&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; wallets held, they are up 54,699,900%. A $100 investment at the start of launch would therefore yield $54.7m. Currently, the price is &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;-87.27% down from ATH&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.certik.com/projects/safemoon&quot;&amp;gt;The Certik Audit is complete&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and notes several major security flaws. Chief of which;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As a result, overtime the _owner address will accumulate a significant portion of LP tokens&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Remember this.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p0i6kr/safemoons_performance_of_mental_gymnastics_in_the/&quot;&amp;gt;The Wallet was supposed to launch at the end of June&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. In early July, with no wallet in sight, the devs &amp;amp;amp; moderators on the Safemoon subreddit &amp;amp;amp; discord &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;pretend they have a beta wallet to test and claim to have distributed it to 500 people who signed an NDA to keep it secret&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;. It&amp;amp;#39;s now 8 months later and not one person has ever confirmed this wallet existed. At all. No redacted screenshots, no download logs. There is no proof of its existence.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Wallet is now scheduled for end of August. A date has been set. Safemooners are utterly convinced it will bring them legitimacy and respect in the Crypto community. Finally, their first real and tangible product. August 28th rolls round and Billboards appear in London &amp;amp;amp; New York advertising the wallet. CEO John Karony is hyping the launch 10 minutes before it is due to be released at 4pm. 4pm rolls around. No wallet. Nothing. Links to Google Play and iOS store redirect to the homepage. A whale sells trillions upon trillions of tokens 30 minutes before launch, causing a huge cascade of price over the next weeks.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://db70102c-bf65-41f3-abcf-4a0026b2dbdd.filesusr.com/ugd/8fd214_665d75779cd440389a8367fe209e307a.pdf&quot;&amp;gt;An independent company called Doxxlocker audits Safemoon&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. They use the previous flaw stated in the Certik audit as their jumping-off point. They discover that via the very same SwapAndLiquify function, an address did indeed accumulate significant quantities of tokens from the LiquidityPool. Those tokens were then wash-traded and sold on the open market. In total, over $68.4m in BNB &amp;amp;amp; Safemoon were sold.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/l8g6xio5aom71.jpg?width=345&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=19083c375455a7e18fac74415e37b67b53bbea8a&quot;&amp;gt;Three team members simultaneously quit.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; The Chief Operating Officer, Chief Blockchain officer and Chief Technology Officer. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/sq5vlh/this_is_how_the_exsafemoon_coo_lives_after_a/&quot;&amp;gt;Jack is now living a life of abject luxury&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; despite &amp;amp;quot;never owning any Safemoon&amp;amp;quot;. Prior to this, he worked as a part time DJ and twitch streamer. Kay.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/plait6/last_call_for_safemoon_the_curtains_are_drawing/&quot;&amp;gt;The Wallet is finally released&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. It has a non-functioning calculator, and many Safemooners notice it looks strangely familiar. It appears to have been built from the open source code of Trust Wallet. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/54q7q8dde0g71.jpg?width=320&amp;amp;amp;crop=smart&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=dca1610ebffeaeb78b6f08734fa6dc1531a37bc8&quot;&amp;gt;[1]&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/lakkh7dde0g71.jpg?width=320&amp;amp;amp;crop=smart&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=6d5b521e8583ad6d441dc34aaf10cc77d472da44&quot;&amp;gt;[2]&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After several updates, to give them credit, in a short amount of time the wallet was more of less functional. It was missing some features from the Roadmap. &amp;amp;quot;Military-grade&amp;amp;quot; encryption was nowhere to be found... and there was no buy button.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The &amp;amp;quot;direct-buy&amp;amp;quot; functionality finally arrives, brought to Safemooners via Wyre. Now you can buy Safemoon with just a 3.9% fee. That means if you buy 1 million Safemoon, you get 900,000 because of the 10% tax and it costs you 3.9% more. When you sell, you are taxed another 10%, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/YRB3nYo.jpg&quot;&amp;gt;so buying Safemoon direct has a whopping 23.9% tax added on top. &amp;amp;quot;ThE eVOlutION!&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r6utx4/history_repeats_itself_another_highranking/&quot;&amp;gt;Thomas leaves.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; The man they called &amp;amp;quot;Papa&amp;amp;quot;. The &amp;amp;quot;Blockchain Wizard&amp;amp;quot;. He had no proven experience coding a single material thing and helped pepretate a story that he rejected a $2,000,000 job offer from Ripple. Thomas originally handed in his notice, then was convinced to stay. He didn&amp;amp;#39;t last long.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitmart is hacked and 28 Trillion Safemoon tokens are stolen and sold on the open market, crashing the price. Moonboys speculate this is only a good thing, as Bitmart will buy back the tokens at a higher price than the market sells, therefore the price will go up. Two months later, it appears Safemoon CEO John Karony has transferred Bitmart Billions of V2 tokens under the counter, profiting, while Safemoon investors are left holding the shit. They didn&amp;amp;#39;t even get reflections from the transfers.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On Halo Infinite&amp;amp;#39;s release day, investors start to demand updates to Roadmap items. Many things were promised before the end of the year, such as the Blockchain and Exchange. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://i.redd.it/3v4pwgymsk481.jpg&quot;&amp;gt;CEO Karony tells them &amp;amp;quot;Hush, Halo time&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. Not once. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://i.redd.it/bwfzctbyek481.jpg&quot;&amp;gt;Twice.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now it&amp;amp;#39;s time to upgrade the contract! Apparently, the reason there is no Safemoon Blockchain, Safemoon Exchange or major Exchange listings are because this token has too many decimals (quick, nobody mention Shib!) so a reverse-split happens, where Safemoon tokens are traded 1000:1 for Safemoon V2.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The &amp;amp;quot;upgrade&amp;amp;quot; is botched. V2 trades at a higher price, and major arbitrage happens. People sell V2, re-buy V1, trade it for V2 tokens and sell, repeating the process to profit. V2 wallets aren&amp;amp;#39;t receiving reflections properly. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ri4iam/amidst_a_botched_upgrade_943_of_safemoon_holders/&quot;&amp;gt;The community is furious and turns on itself&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Safemoon puts their best minds together and comes up with a plan &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/3lpq6vj3uh881.jpg?width=354&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=c335b14faf664baf24e66a5f2ec34beddc1a9499&quot;&amp;gt;to implement a 100% tax on the V1 token&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, confiscating any funds transacted into the liquidity pool. They signal intention to do this just 1.5 hours before implementing the 100% tax. Many, many, many investors lose thousands and thousands of dollars. Safemoon has not mentioned any plan to reimburse these folks. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://np.reddit.com/r/SafeMoonCase/comments/sztaht/the_wheels_are_in_full_motion_safemoon_class/&quot;&amp;gt;Currently, a second Class-Action lawsuit&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; is brewing because people rightfully feel like Safemoon has stolen their money.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9jSoXYhv8g&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Operation Pheonix&amp;amp;quot; &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;[sic]&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; has been revealed.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; Safemoon is now a &amp;amp;quot;Human-focused technology company&amp;amp;quot; who are spraying Rain-X onto wind turbines built by a third party, in order to generate energy in The Gambia, where a portion of the energy generated will convert into Safemoon. None of the mechanics are clear. The benefits of application of &amp;amp;quot;nanotechnology&amp;amp;quot; &amp;amp;quot;hydrophilic&amp;amp;quot; particles are not clear. How this ties into a Cryptocurrency is not clear. It&amp;amp;#39;s alleged people can have ownership of these wind turbines via an NFT - how that works is not clear. Safemoon community continues to confuse Windmills with Wind Turbines. Windmills mill wheat into flour. That has always been clear.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Safemoon opens their headquarters in Utah. A large office section of a building on a business estate is leased. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/jahvltsfkjk71.png?width=1029&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=00ed93b57be316342f4dff35b05c9e07e7666ce8&quot;&amp;gt;Safemoon claim to have 90 employees&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, but only about 5 of them have ever been seen.   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FIEzAcmWYAEl0vv?format=jpg&amp;amp;amp;name=large&quot;&amp;gt;Advertisements go up in Times Square&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. These play for 15 seconds per hour, every hour of every day, for an entire year. Looking at Advertisement companies in Times Square, one of these billboards would cost between $6-15m dollars for a year. Safemoon has 4 large ones. These billboards have not materially increased the token holders, price or volume.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Mandala exchange, a tiny offshoot of Binance with one of the lowest CEX volume rankings &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://i.redd.it/0sujr5x6i2f81.jpg&quot;&amp;gt;announces they are officially adding Safemoon&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. Mandala does not allow trading in the US. The launch is set for Feb 17th. The 17th Arrives. Mandala releases a statement saying they are having issues implementing Safemoon, but to hang tight. A few days later, they release another statement saying they are having unforeseen issues and &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/qkalxm2nplj81.jpg?width=622&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=d86c46cc03881e880099916a4aa57b60fff598e2&quot;&amp;gt;advise to withdraw all Safemoon deposited onto Mandala&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;3 months after V2 launch, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://bscscan.com/token/0x42981d0bfbAf196529376EE702F2a9Eb9092fcB5&quot;&amp;gt;only 626,000 of the 3 million Safemoon V1 wallets&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; have migrated. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/lnajequunw981.jpg?width=568&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=147320ca26f3d862f6b9eaf61a9d93834c080f9a&quot;&amp;gt;Of the 626,000 wallets, 79% of these holders have less than $600&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s now today, March 2nd 2022. A full year after Safemoon was released. Safemoon teases a month of surprises, and kicks the celebrations off by changing the domain of Safemoon.net website to Safemoon.com, and changing the logo. There are no other changes.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Happy Birthday, Safemoon.&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The overwhelming majority of people using the app to trade in bitcoin are men, making up 79% of users to just 21% women. Compared with the most recent data from the U.K.’s Office for National Statistics, or ONS, this makes the gender divide among bitcoin holders even wider than with other investments.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;So, is it overconfidence?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Barber and Odean found that men trade stocks 45% more frequently than women, which is a symptom of overconfidence because overconfident investors trade excessively&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If we see from that research study that men are, on average, more inclined to be overconfident, that overconfidence could be helping to drive the heavier representation of men in these much more speculative markets. It really takes a bit of a hope and a prayer to believe that these assets are going to be long-term, reliable investment performers.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Users can earn BAT by viewing these ads, and Brave keeps a cut (30%) to run their operations. This process has been steadily regressing, with more and more issues this month and seems to be capitulating.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://community.brave.com/c/brave-rewards/71&quot;&amp;gt;https://community.brave.com/c/brave-rewards/71&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Their community forum is full of people experiencing Brave&amp;amp;#39;s terrible payout system. Basically, Brave tells you you&amp;amp;#39;ll get paid the 5-7th, but that isn&amp;amp;#39;t happening. Your rewards seem to disappear, and then you hope one day you get paid. The Brave Team seems to expect their millions of users to individually PM them to get it resolved on a wallet-by wallet basis, and as you can imagine, they aren&amp;amp;#39;t able to keep up. Now they&amp;amp;#39;re rolling people&amp;amp;#39;s rewards over to the next month, essentially just holding people&amp;amp;#39;s money until they look into it more.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bravebat.info/brave_initiated_bat_purchase&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.bravebat.info/brave_initiated_bat_purchase&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
Brave touts 54 million active monthly users, but has failed to convert those numbers into revenue. The link above shows that for 54MM users, they&amp;amp;#39;ve never done more than $3MM in monthly BAT sales, which they only keep 30% of. This is pennies a month per user, and means that Brave is massively cash flow negative, as they claim hundreds of employees. They have completely failed to effectively monetize their massive user base, and now we&amp;amp;#39;re seeing they&amp;amp;#39;re completely in over their head.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you head over to &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/batproject&quot;&amp;gt;r/batproject&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, you&amp;amp;#39;ll see that the Brave Team has stopped engaging their users, unless they have a very canned response. Their &amp;amp;quot;Director of Engagement&amp;amp;quot; posts very rarely, and they refuse to respond to questions of users. The red flags are adding up, and my guess is that Brave is failing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Investing in BAT I&amp;amp;#39;m realizing is like investing in a private company, and is actually a regressive way to invest. They don&amp;amp;#39;t disclose their runrate, revenue, all revenue sources, executive compensation and many other key metrics that you can see at any publicly traded company. However, Brave touts &amp;amp;quot;transparency&amp;amp;quot; every chance they get, while being about as transparent as milk when it comes to any issues with the payouts.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Perhaps the most damming metric is the 0 growth in ad campaigns in the US. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bravebat.info/brave_ads_campaigns?country=United%20States&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.bravebat.info/brave_ads_campaigns?country=United%20States&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Shows 2 years of flat US ad campaigns, so US advertisers don&amp;amp;#39;t want this. plenty of big names have come through, and very few of run repeat campaigns. If you use the browser, the ads you&amp;amp;#39;ll get now are from very low quality companies, similar to when the browser first started.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I think it&amp;amp;#39;s clear that BAT is failing. Most people on here get maybe a couple of quarters a month, after being told how valuable their data is. Most people think the rewards are a complete joke on here, and I guess they are, and the team&amp;amp;#39;s response is certainly telling of a team in complete disarray. The idea of privacy browser that compensates you for your ad viewing is brilliant, but this team&amp;amp;#39;s execution of that concept ain&amp;amp;#39;t it. It&amp;amp;#39;s been years, they won&amp;amp;#39;t talk about what&amp;amp;#39;s going on, and it&amp;amp;#39;s getting worse. Take a look through that first link, it&amp;amp;#39;s not good.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These issues have gotten worse over the years, and clearly Brave isn&amp;amp;#39;t going to be &amp;amp;quot;transparent&amp;amp;quot; about the problem. I would advise any investors to assume that if the team won&amp;amp;#39;t answer their questions, it&amp;amp;#39;s because the answer is really bad. The Brave Team won&amp;amp;#39;t answer these questions on &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/batproject&quot;&amp;gt;r/batproject&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; - go take a look, they&amp;amp;#39;ve been asked for years, the team will engage and then ghost any question they don&amp;amp;#39;t like.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

In this thread, I will share my experience on the perfect breakdown. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To start, you want at least 70% in BTC. This is the granddaddy of all coins and your most stable. The higher the percentage of BTC, the better.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Next is ETH, I’ve found 60% is a good level. Even if you just have BTC and ETH, you will have 130% of your portfolio in 2 coins, up for 100% you started with. To instantly have 30% more, you are genius. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Next up is the large-cap alts. I like 30% here. You can LRDYOR (let Redditors do your own research) to decide which coin is best for you, but possible examples are SOL, ADA, DOT, LINK, AVAX, etc. Following advice up to this point, you have at least 160% portfolio. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Keeping 20% stables is key to any portfolio. You can earn interest (up to 20%) on stables, plus any price action. I saw one tik-tok’er predict Tether would go to $5 this year. I think that’s bullish, but I can easily see USDT going to $3. Let’s say you earn 20% interest on your 20% investment, you now have 40% (compounding interest works wonders). Now your portfolio allocation is at 200% and you have doubled your money. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now that you have doubled your money, going for 100% portfolio allocation to 200%, you have freedom to gamble on low cap coins. I’d keep this to 10%. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This strategy will work for everyone. It will instantly turn you into a billionaire overnight. Follow me for more financial advice.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now imagine you want to leave Russia and bring money with you. You don&amp;amp;#39;t want to hold Rubles because they&amp;amp;#39;re losing value by the second. You can&amp;amp;#39;t hold foreign currency. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How do you bring money with you? Crypto. You buy lots of BTC and ETH, store your wallet keys safely, and leave the country with no one any the wiser. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Russians will use crypto to get out of the hellhole that is Russia and start a new life, now that they can&amp;amp;#39;t use foreign currencies to do it.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Amidst the Russian invasion in Ukraine, Mykhailo Fedorov – the latter’s Vice Prime Minister – asked the leading digital asset platforms to freeze all Russian users’ blockchain addresses. According to the politician, the move would weaken Russia and aid Ukraine’s defense.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The Moola, the dinero, cash that&amp;amp;#39;s the most important thing that I get out of cryptocurrency.   All of that privacy jargon is cool and all, but I just heard Gas will hit $10 by EOY in California which means it will be close to $7 on the east coast.     My taxes on a regular home went up 30% in two years, 2 slices of pizza, and a drink come out to $10, and now the town decided it was the perfect idea to TRIPLE OUR WATER BILL! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;YES, they actually tripled it.   Turns out the previous mayor didn&amp;amp;#39;t pay the water bill from the other city we get water from for like 8 years!.    Great that I have to pay for the previous home owner&amp;amp;#39;s water bill.  Why not right?    But the absolute worst thing about what we are going through right now is the idea that &amp;amp;quot;crypto is the problem&amp;amp;quot; and it&amp;amp;#39;s being used as one of the scape goats in the Ukraine/Russia war.   God, people are so FKing stupid to believe this shit. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/acyupa6vrsk81.jpg?width=1184&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=1402d66b989ee6048bec4f4ed100fe1a8bc28a17&quot;&amp;gt;Cryptocurrencies risk undermining sanctions against Russia, allowing Putin and his cronies to evade economic pain.  &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Except this is not whats happening, and on the contrary its Ukraine thats using crypto for good. Yet none of these Senators celebrate crypto for what its actually being used for, but instead create a non-story to serve their vested interests of slamming crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How pathetic could all of this get? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;She just wants an opportunity to somehow link it to hit out against crypto. Using her public and visible position to spread her own agenda when the country thats most affected by whats going on is actually  using crypto for the betterment of its people in the present terrible situation. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/wqgx98gwssk81.jpg?width=1198&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=699dcd94d491efbe6d57968d1606ba9cbd1aea67&quot;&amp;gt;Infact, just now Ukraine took up on Gavin Wood&amp;amp;#39;s generous offer too. &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And was able to find a bit of humor even in circumstances such as now..&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: There are of course a possibility that this could happen, but as of now there is no evidence that it is happening. Nor is it likely in the future, infact Russia is more likely to use China&amp;amp;#39;s SWIFT replacement known as CIPS - Cross-Border Interbank Payment System, or use their own SWIFT replacement SPFS (less likely as low liquidity).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPFS&quot;&amp;gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPFS&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; - Russian Central Bank has already said SPFS could be an option, and 23 countries foreign banks are already connected to it. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;USA is already the largest liquid crypto markets, if Russia starts accepting crypto for their strategically important export oil, they wont have any places to spend their crypto as the liquid USD-crypto market is already closed for them. Whats the point of earning say 10,000 crypto coins for a million barrels of oil, if they cant spend it anywhere due to lack of counterparties willing to trade with them? Russian Ruble - crypto pairs are non-existent today. Also, they cant use that crypto to buy commodities from other countries either, as these countries could come under risk of sanction themselves, and furthermore high volume crypto-commodity market is also non-existent right now. No country is going to be ready to start accepting say 10m  tonnes of Wheat for Crypto. Such a scenario is not even possible right now given the structure of crypto markets.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That is why it is important for USA to actually build dominance in crypto markets, and yet you have people like Liz spinning up a&amp;amp;quot;crypto is bad&amp;amp;quot; narrative whenever they get the chance to do    &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Being afraid of Russia using crypto to evade sanctions is literally being scared of the boogeyman, especially when CIPS and SPFS offer much more immediate options for them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The article mostly talks about how Bitcoin is a huge pump and dump scheme and you know how it&amp;amp;#39;s a scam.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;I’m tired of saying, “Be careful, it’s speculative.” Then, “Be careful, it’s gambling.” Then, “Be careful, it’s a bubble.” Okay, I’ll say it: Bitcoin is a scam.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Followed by&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Bitcoins are accepted almost nowhere, and some cryptocurrencies nowhere at all.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Well we have seen how it turned out to be with global adoption very close and crypto helping a crisis in the world right now.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But what is interesting is another Vox&amp;amp;#39;s  article years later &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/recode/22383757/bitcoin-coinbase-ipo-crypto-ethereum-cryptocurrency&quot;&amp;gt;Like it or not, you should probably start paying attention to bitcoin&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s mostly a Coin base shill but it proves  how awfully wrong and manipulative media can be.  Being updated with  crypto news could be helpful but it mostly fucks up your investment because of the constant confusion.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The best thing to do would be to consider media as entertainment and never to take any financial decision because of it. Especially Panic selling or fomoing no matter what the experts&amp;amp;quot; say.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Stick to your plan without getting manipulated into selling or buying because of news.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
