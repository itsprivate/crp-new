&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But the aftermath is surreal. Let me explain. The tokens that were locked on Ethereum side are supposedly to peg for existence of tokens on Harmony chain. So, all the tokens on Ethereum side (Horizon bridge) were stolen, which means the tokens minted on Harmony chain were basically worthless as there are nothing to back for their existence.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So what are you gonna do with those &amp;amp;#39;worthless&amp;amp;#39; tokens (1WBTC, 1ETH, 1USDC)? You gotta swap for other tokens to take advantage of their price in the liquidity pools, which has not been updated. This explain certain pumps of JEWEL, TRANQ, FIRA, ROY.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/zpw2kseomm791.png?width=3414&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=087623c44646a961c426e13b83926109c3198e39&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/zpw2kseomm791.png?width=3414&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=087623c44646a961c426e13b83926109c3198e39&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/6mpaacgsmm791.png?width=3414&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=51bd8b6d3090f0ebd5b893d08320a63af3a22402&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/6mpaacgsmm791.png?width=3414&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=51bd8b6d3090f0ebd5b893d08320a63af3a22402&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/huowsjetmm791.png?width=3414&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=1376c340582c0e2d315495bf21d8c57b566428a5&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/huowsjetmm791.png?width=3414&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=1376c340582c0e2d315495bf21d8c57b566428a5&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then, you wait for people who don&amp;amp;#39;t know what happen and FOMO in. Finally, whales exit for ONE to dump on centralised exchanges and people who put money in eventually turn to be exit liquidity.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We&amp;amp;#39;re in bear market now, and I don&amp;amp;#39;t think there&amp;amp;#39;s gonna be any VC to bail out Harmony for tokens lost on Horizon bridge.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Harmony One is probably Harmony Done now!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Not trying to cause any further distress. But I urge anyone who holds their ONE, please don&amp;amp;#39;t listen to anyone telling you to buy the dip, including ONE and tokens on its chain. You&amp;amp;#39;re gonna be their exit liquidity.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit #1: So someone said I am FUDDING. Heck no. And their argument is that price of ONE has not been down much. It&amp;amp;#39;s clearly shown you have no idea of what is going on now. Look at the price of those tokens I show. They dumped their bags for ONE, because ONE is the only token they could cash out on CEX for real stablecoins like USDT. So that&amp;amp;#39;s why ONE has not gone down much. But be prepared for a dump of ONE on CEX.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Harmony One just got hacked for over 100m as their cross chain bridge was almost entirely drained, leaving anyone holding the wrapped version of their tokens 1ETH, 1USDC etc completely up shit creek. Harmony have disabled the bridge for the time being and prices of various assets on Harmony have completely shit the bed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In a post over 6 months ago Vitalik outlined the dangers of cross chain bridges:&amp;amp;#39;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/rwojtk/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_7_07_january/hrngyk8/&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/rwojtk/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_7_07_january/hrngyk8/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now, imaging what happens if you move  100 ETH onto a bridge on Solana to get 100 Solana-WETH, and then  Ethereum gets 51% attacked. The attacker deposited a bunch of their own  ETH into Solana-WETH and then reverted that transaction on the Ethereum  side as soon as the Solana side confirmed it. The Solana-WETH contract  is now no longer fully backed, and perhaps your 100 Solana-WETH is now  only worth 60 ETH. Even if there&amp;amp;#39;s a perfect ZK-SNARK-based bridge that  fully validates consensus, it&amp;amp;#39;s still vulnerable to theft through 51%  attacks like this.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;For  this reason, it&amp;amp;#39;s always safer to hold Ethereum-native assets on  Ethereum or Solana-native assets on Solana than it is to hold  Ethereum-native assets on Solana or Solana-native assets on Ethereum&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is just an excerpt from the post but the whole thing is really worth a read. It explains the inherent risk and dangers involved in cross-chain bridges. Now more than ever I think it&amp;amp;#39;s important to remind people that tokenized &amp;amp;quot;wrapped&amp;amp;quot; assets on other chains are *not* the same as having the token on the native chain.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

While that did mean I wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t be able to claim 5m USD, due to the lack of impact, it should&amp;amp;#39;ve still been worth 150k.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A couple of weeks go by and... nothing. Chain said they&amp;amp;#39;d respond in 96 hours and just walked off. Immunefi automatically re-subscribed, as Chain was in breach of their resolution time frame, and got Chain to respond!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Because this impact does not have any significance to any users,  there is no business impact on this matter. We apologize for the delayed  response but this needed to be thoroughly reviewed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We will award you $10,000.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Veda99646 (Chain)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; changed severity from Critical to Informational&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Out of scope but paying&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How can you say you&amp;amp;#39;ll honor something as in scope, just to later say it&amp;amp;#39;s out of scope? Since when is a double spend, with proof of concept, solely informational? It was so outrageous I reached out to Immunefi, the arbitrators, because surely this in violation of not only their posted bug bounty, yet easily shown to be Chain lying in an attempt to keep their funds.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;We believe that there is no impact as the development and support for &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chain/chain/&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;https://github.com/chain/chain/&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;  has ended and it is now archived and therefore no users are at risk.  Project agreed that it was wrong of them to include this repository in  in-scope section, so we think that the payout offered by the project is  fair.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Immunefi acknowledged the repo was in-scope, didn&amp;amp;#39;t contest this was a critical vulnerability on the repo, yet &amp;amp;#39;company made a mistake and apologized so now you don&amp;amp;#39;t get paid&amp;amp;#39;. Also, it wasn&amp;amp;#39;t archived. There was no notice on the GH repository, nor in the README, which I did point out.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Immunefi came back with a &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chain/chain/commit/6f8f079ab44194ccacfe45d2e847c9e4c5808e02&quot;&amp;gt;commit&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; adding an archival notice from a few years ago (a commit which I&amp;amp;#39;d assume was provided by Chain). Funnily enough, they didn&amp;amp;#39;t also come back with the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chain/chain/commit/82682a361a4fa3200df76abd7198d69359337ffd&quot;&amp;gt;commit deleting the archival notice&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; from last year. While Chain has since archived the repository, and removed the last traces of Chain Core from their site (as I pointed those out to Immunefi) &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20220531183905/https://github.com/chain/chain/&quot;&amp;gt;the Wayback Machine doesn&amp;amp;#39;t lie&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, and I have &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20220223101920/https://chain.com/core/&quot;&amp;gt;all of it saved&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With their response though, they did say the following:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;It was listed as in scope on Immunefi, with &amp;amp;quot;Blockchain/DLT&amp;amp;quot; explicitly marked as having a critical bug bounty&amp;amp;quot;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;this is correct, both Immunefi and the project never said otherwise.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How can Immunefi fully acknowledge it&amp;amp;#39;s in scope, with a critical bug bounty, have no one be contesting the bug&amp;amp;#39;s existence, and say it&amp;amp;#39;s not eligible for a critical bug bounty? On what planet does any of this make sense?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After responding yet again, they then didn&amp;amp;#39;t respond for weeks, despite following up, until I said I planned to publicly disclose this (as allowed), at which point they finally said said disclosure would cause them to void the offer for 10k.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Well. Here&amp;amp;#39;s my disclosure. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;If you use Chain Core, there&amp;amp;#39;s a trivial double spend possible, allowing exponentially minting funds. They don&amp;amp;#39;t properly check you can&amp;amp;#39;t spend the same coins multiple times in a single transaction.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Chain has claimed they have such no clients, yet if you, or your company, does use this (notably with an active B2B contract with Chain), PLEASE SPEAK UP. I&amp;amp;#39;d also like to disclose Chain is a company which lies in their bug bounty process, and disclose Immunefi won&amp;amp;#39;t hesitate to side with corporations, even while they actively acknowledge the corporation is at fault, to deprive legitimate disclosures their advertised payouts. I no longer believe Immunefi can be effective arbitrators and will not recommend them in the future.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As one final question, what even is $XCN? It&amp;amp;#39;s #34, with a blog post from months ago saying it partnered with Alameda to be their &amp;amp;quot;market maker&amp;amp;quot;.

I’m pretty sure everyone here knows Tether isn’t fully backed and it’s a matter of time before the house of cards falls.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This isn’t fud, just trying to help some people out there.  No need to sell your BTC, ETH or any other projects you believe in.  But be very cautious with yields and stable coins.  Ideally it’s best to hold your own coins in cold storage.  Keep stacking&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The realized losses, meaning actual losses after people sell, have reached about $22.67 billion and is likely even over $23 billion as we are speaking.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Is this a bottom signal? No, definitely not but this just shows how brutal this crash has been so far you can very well argue that this has been worse than 2018 and makes the 2021 may correction look like literally nothing. And in this environment it is definitely remarkable how many are still here.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We may get to $40b realized losses or more. But all that matters is that you don&amp;amp;#39;t get caught by paper hands and sell yourself. Of course we very likely won&amp;amp;#39;t hit a new ATH this year. But as Crypto has shows in the past that patience is key.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Until I actually looked at the data.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While there was indisputably some positive effect of having extra cash on the market, numbers showed that the effect wasn&amp;amp;#39;t as big as you would expect. Nor was it even what triggered the bull market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Why wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t over $5 Trillion of extra cash not have a profound impact on Bitcoin and the crypto market?&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Keep in mind, the full $5 Trillion didn&amp;amp;#39;t go into stimulus checks, much less into crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Only $1.8T went to individuals.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The rest went to healthcare, local government, airline industry, businesses, etc...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Something that would maybe still help stocks more, but not so much crypto  (at the time, the correlation to stocks still wasn&amp;amp;#39;t strong, around 0.4-0.5).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Even the $1.8T didn&amp;amp;#39;t all go to stimulus checks. A big part went to Child tax credits, SNAP, unemployment, retirement.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/11/us/how-covid-stimulus-money-was-spent.html&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/11/us/how-covid-stimulus-money-was-spent.html&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;$817B went to stimulus checks.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;What percentage of the stimulus checks actually went into crypto?&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;According to Mizuho research, about 10% of stimulus recipient planned on investing their check in stocks or crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yahoo.com/video/nearly-10-of-the-380-billion-in-stimulus-checks-may-be-used-to-buy-bitcoin-and-stocks-survey-131009531.html&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.yahoo.com/video/nearly-10-of-the-380-billion-in-stimulus-checks-may-be-used-to-buy-bitcoin-and-stocks-survey-131009531.html&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Mizuho has estimated that the amount used from stimulus check would only have added about a 2-3% to the market value of Bitcoin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;What was happening to Bitcoin before Covid, and did Covid and Fed printing trigger the bull run?&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One of the first problems I ran into with this theory, is Bitcoin was already at the beginning of a bull market, and had already made its turning point, before any of the stimulus checks, or before Covid became a big world issue.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/aazxmafqge791.jpg?width=1788&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=111c221e82f6d7859d354c3d58de342b33dd7a97&quot;&amp;gt;Turning point for Bitcoin, beginning of bull market, and Covid interruption&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Stimulus checks didn&amp;amp;#39;t trigger the bull market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The bearish and selling pressure had already been exhausted, already reverted to bullish and buying pressure, already had a breakout, and already had its first parabolic run to $13K. Which had already corrected, and the resuming bull trend got interrupted with the Covid crash.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;The actual timeline of the stimulus checks versus the price of Bitcoin.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the following chart are the zones where the stimulus started to hit people&amp;amp;#39;s accounts.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Direct deposits are yellow, mailed checks are orange.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s in &amp;amp;quot;zones&amp;amp;quot; because not everyone got their checks instantly or at the same time. There were also waves, delays, etc...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Keep in mind, there would likely be additional time between the time those funds are received, and the time they can actually be traded on an exchange, especially if they have to open their first account.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/tpxt0245he791.jpg?width=1541&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=a3f51200f2bfb45246c73a66930c0db3e24de6c6&quot;&amp;gt;First stimulus check distribution&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/dvfy5w79he791.jpg?width=1890&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e89c99f58dc4a41551e987b9e33d0fbd9f8f0342&quot;&amp;gt;Third stimulus check distribution&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All 3 distributions are followed by a downtrend.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The difference is in the 3rd distribution, there is crabbing throughout most of the distribution, followed by a crash.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Research has found that the stimulus checks may have only affected Bitcoin trading by an estimated 3.8%&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;According to the research done about stimulus checks, by the Federal Reserve Bank, only 0.02% of all the Cares Act fund distributed went into Bitcoin, with only an estimated 3.8% increase in trading resulting from the stimulus money.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/newsroom-and-events/publications/working-papers/2021-working-papers/wp-2113-impact-of-covid19-stimulus-checks-on-retail-trading-in-bitcoin.aspx&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/newsroom-and-events/publications/working-papers/2021-working-papers/wp-2113-impact-of-covid19-stimulus-checks-on-retail-trading-in-bitcoin.aspx&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;3.8% is still impactful, but probably nowhere near as high as people would have expected. Much less the source of the majority of the trading.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;The true effect of the stimulus checks.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The stimulus checks still had some effect.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But not so much in creating or increasing the bull market, but in compensating and decreasing the negative macros and fears of the Covid crisis.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The market was in high fear of businesses closing, and going into a bear market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The stimulus checks wiped out a lot of that fear.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The effect didn&amp;amp;#39;t come so much from the stimulus checks going into crypto, as the data shows, but came more in a psychological way in wiping out the fear of a bear market from the Covid crisis, just enough to allow the crypto bull market to resume.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The stimulus check didn&amp;amp;#39;t add much money or liquidity to crytpo, but it kept average Joe from running out of money, and removed the pitfall of Covid, to allow the crypto bull market to continue to run free and unimpeded.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;According to &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.coinbase.com/the-rise-of-crypto-in-higher-education-81b648c2466f&quot;&amp;gt;this study&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; from 2018 (surely the number is higher currently), 42% of top 50 universities offer a course in blockchain or cryptocurrencies.  Here&amp;amp;#39;s a list of schools offering courses in crypto that I know of or was able to find with a quick search, in no particular order. If you know of any more, please comment and I&amp;amp;#39;ll add it to the list. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

You can check the data of previous crashes and make some conclusions. This is not advice, but if you’re in the group that thinks that “history repeats itself” it could be a good idea to wait a few months until the stock market and the crypto market dumps again and find a better enter position.
On the other side, I think that is not a bad idea to start a DCA strategy since we are really low in prices right now, specially BTC and ETH. I’m sure they will dump in the future, but maybe not enough to try to time the bottom.
Anyways, this year can be a great opportunity to buy if you believe in crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

This is always laughed at by people saying how bi-polar it is in here. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However, like everything in social media, I believe there are agendas from bots/paid actors, multi accounts that deliberately push to sentiment here in a bullish/bearish direction for their financial gain. They could be either shorting or going long with heavy positions. When the market shifts directions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I have never interacted with so many experts that say crypto is dead now, and only meant for scams/ponzis - the tech is all BS. I also have received many downvotes for stating that crypto, mainly BTC is fine and will rebound - but when crypto is climbing, its filled with upvotes. This heavy sentiment shift leads me to believe there is an agenda to attack indecisive investor emotions to either sell or buy, so they can profiit.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So don&amp;amp;#39;t forget, when there are profits to made that can leverage off the public, the people you are talking to here or other platforms with their crypto advice could actually just be trying to move the market in one direction. In other words they could ultimately believe in BTC but just want to talk crap so you sell, and they scoop up more cheap BTC.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Stick to your plan no matter what people say who just want you to follow the sentiment.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Voyager&amp;amp;#39;s exposure to 3AC consists of 15,250 BTC and $350 million USDC. The Company made an initial request for a repayment of $25 million USDC by June 24, 2022, and subsequently requested repayment of the entire balance of USDC and BTC by June 27, 2022. Neither of these amounts has been repaid, and failure by 3AC to repay either requested amount by these specified dates will constitute an event of default. Voyager intends to pursue recovery from 3AC and is in discussions with the Company&amp;amp;#39;s advisors regarding the legal remedies available. The Company is unable to assess at this point the amount it will be able to recover from 3AC&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Few hours back just out of curiosity I tried leverage on Binance.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I started with 78 USDT and used leverage of 3x with BTC, voila I made a profit of few dollars and felt like a king. I increased the leverage to 5x and the winning streak continued. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Next, I leveraged with Ethereum and leveraged 10x and it was wonderful. I was feeling on the top of the world, nothing could stop me. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After first timers luck the degen ape in me woke up and I leveraged 25x on ShibaInu and the house of cards came falling in front of me. All of my profit from earlier trades was wiped out and my capital of 78 USDT decimated to 50 USDT. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I was hysterical and went all in on Shiba again with leverage of 50x and recovered my loss and made a mind boggling profit of 5 USDT.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My take from my experiment with leverage : &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Don&amp;amp;#39;t leverage, Don&amp;amp;#39;t play with futures, it is very demanding.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You will be constantly checking prices/profit or loss.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;It is addictive and this gambling can ruin you financially. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;My mental peace was gone and I was barely able to sleep for 2 hours and even in my sleep I was dreaming about charts.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;conclusion - Don&amp;amp;#39;t leverage / play with future else it will destroy your future. If you want to do it properly follow stop-loss.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Given that we are going to get diminishing returns and still get bear markets of -70 or more,  does HODL truly make sense?  We’ve officially reached the cycle where the diminishing returns are so apparent that we breached previous ATH.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It seems that the smartest strategy is to buy in the bear market and sell your whole stack in the bull run.   Obviously you won’t catch the top or bottom but it’s a better way to preserve your capital.   Will you be DCA’ing in the next bull run once/if we break 70k?   I just hate how taking profits it’s frowned in this community and ppl are encouraged to HODL which is a penny stock promoter scam tactic.  To each their own.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m sure bitcoin still has big bull runs in its future but I don&amp;amp;#39;t see any evidence of what libertarian hard-core crypto people claim about it happening.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Ultimately though I think much of the massive money that gets put in by whales is to pump up the market and eventually cash a lot out when it gets big enough, and leaves retailers in many cases screwed over. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The new CEO of Tether. We are a Multi Billion dollar company. That&amp;amp;#39;s at least four zeros in our net worth. But not before a decimal place&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I know that the cryptocurrency space has been generally weary weary of us. Despite us doing audits from people that &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;we&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; trust.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Look. It was hard for us to back the asset 1:1 with a dollar. That shit is mad worthless these days. We did so initially. And it was the plan. But you know, things happen.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But we have heard you guys out. You guys want to know WHAT our tokens are backed by. You DON&amp;amp;#39;T want it backed by &amp;amp;quot;commercial paper&amp;amp;quot; and other fun things. We will do an &amp;amp;quot;actual&amp;amp;quot; audit soon. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is why we shall just swap all 70 billion USDT with DAI, which IS backed by US dollars. Doing some simple math,&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;USDT = DAI = USD&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;USDT = USD&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Ask me anything&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
