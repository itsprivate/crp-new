I‚Äôve seen statement thrown around like ‚ÄúCBDC will render Bitcoin useless.‚Äù&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you thought so, here is some clarity on what CBDC‚Äôs actually help to accomplish. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Agust√≠n Carstens, head of the Bank of International Settlements: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpNnTuK5JJU&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpNnTuK5JJU&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We don‚Äôt know who‚Äôs using a $100 bill today and we don‚Äôt know who‚Äôs using a 1,000 peso bill today.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The key difference with the CBDC is the central bank will have absolute control on the rules and regulations that will determine the use of that expression of central bank liability, and also we will have the technology to enforce that.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is not a joke, nor are they even trying to be subtle about it. The goal of CBDC is to enable governments to have complete control over people‚Äôs finances. They can already do this to a great extent with the current financial system where most transactions are already electronic, but due to intermediaries like retail banks, the Central Banks are not in an immediate position to halt or know about everyone‚Äôs finances. CBDCs are designed to over come this. With CBDCs, the government can directly seize a user‚Äôs funds without having to go through retail banks.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
 The current electronic payment system already allows governments and central banks to have complete control over the users of the electronic network. CBDCs just help them exert their control in a more efficient manner. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is how CBDCs are implemented in China. Everything is through their CBDC Digital Yuan app. Money cannot leave that app, nor can it be sent to anyone outside that network. This is how every single proposed CBDC framework looks like. You can transfer/receive CBDCs from others on the same network, thats all. All the funds on the network are ring fenced and cannot leave or enter this system unless the central bank allows for it. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/pjh9gk0u7bi81.jpg?width=2560&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=dec8bd3d91cdc23daf668bcb3bdab4034df1ca4e&quot;&amp;gt;Digital Yuan app&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;CBDC shills (i.e. central bankers, regulators etc) will try to claim CBDC&amp;amp;#39;s are &amp;amp;quot;programmable money&amp;amp;quot;. They are not wrong, but it is &amp;amp;quot;programmable&amp;amp;quot; only by the central bank and the programming enables them to stop payments and remove your access to money. CBDC&amp;amp;#39;s are not programmable by end users, developers who want to build with the CBDC. Any attempt to program CBDC must be signed off by the central banks. They are just stealing terms like &amp;amp;quot;programmable money&amp;amp;quot; from decentralised cryptocurrency jargon and using this narrative to pitch to those who do not have an understanding about crypto for the CBDC gotcha moment: &amp;amp;quot;Look CBDCs are here, now your crypto coins dont have a use!&amp;amp;quot;. It&amp;amp;#39;s false advertising for those unaware of what CBDCs are. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you thought CBDCs are going to allow you to invest in your favourite defi apps or use it as a replacement for USD Stablecoins to earn more interest, that is not going to happen. Once CBDCs are mainstream, the next goal would be to prohibit cash transactions completely, so that the entire economy can be controlled by a centralised entity. The only obstacle standing in this path is the emergence of decentralised currencies.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;CBDCs are a privacy nightmare straight from a dystopian novel, and an autocrats dream. Central Banks are taking the worst of the crypto industry and devising ways to use it so that the governments can have even more power over their subjects.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This post will probably get downvoted and buried to hell because I know there are a LOT of CRO holders here, but people will want to understand these points, add a dash of skepticism to things they read on public forums, and critically assess their investments and competition of those investments.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;First off, I will give credit where credit is due:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;They own the greatest domain.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;They have been KILLING it with their marketing. (Could their massive budget also be used to pay online shills?)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However, neither of these things, guarantee that CRO will be a great investment.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In fact, I will argue that it is actually NOT a great investment because there are much better options for everything that CRO/CDC offers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;CRO Argument: &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;3% back on spending with locking up $4,000 worth of CRO for 6 months.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Better Alternative: &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Coinbase debit card 4% back on spending with $0 lock up.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;  Obviously superior, period, end of discussion.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;CRO Argument: Yeah, but‚Ä¶ &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;10% staking reward for 6 month lock-up on Jade/Indigo card+ and Netflix/Spotify reimbursement.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Better Alternatives: If you actually want to hold CRO, you can get up to &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;60% APR on &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://app.osmosis.zone/pools&quot;&amp;gt;the CRO/OSMO LP on Osmosis&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; with only 14-day lock-up AND rewards paid during unbonding.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The added rewards will MORE than cover the cost of Netflix/Spotify.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Here&amp;amp;#39;s a comparison with some better stake/lend rewards on other coins:&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;table&amp;gt;&amp;lt;thead&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;th&amp;gt;Coin&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;th&amp;gt;APR&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;th&amp;gt;Lock-up&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/thead&amp;gt;&amp;lt;tbody&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;CDC card stake&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;10%&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;180 days&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;ATOM&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;14%&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;21 days&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;OSMO&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;81%&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;14 days&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;JUNO&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;112%&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;28 days&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;SCRT&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;24%&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;21 days&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;UST&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;19.5%&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;0 days&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/tbody&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/table&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;CRO Argument: Yeah, but‚Ä¶ you could get &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;higher earn rates on other coins.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Better Alternative: Sure, you may get slightly higher rates, but &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;you have to lock-up your coins for 3 months and stake $4,000 in CRO&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; (both have opportunity costs and many people undervalue how much sacrificing liquidity could cost you when better opportunities arise).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;I‚Äôd much rather lend my BTC, ETH, etc. on &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;platforms with good returns and ZERO lock-up time and ZERO other coin stake&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; ‚Äì like FTX app, Celsius, and Ledn.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;BTC Earn Rates:

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;CDC: 6.5% with 3 month lock-up and $4,000 CRO stake.  Stake less CRO or only 1 month lock-up and rate drops to 4.5%.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;FTX App: 8% with 0 lock-up or other coin stake (up to $10k BTC)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Ledn: 6.25% with 0 lock-up or other coin stake (up to 0.5 BTC)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Celsius: 6.20% with 0 lock-up or other coin stake (up to 0.25 BTC)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The exchange itself ‚Äì  &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Crypto.com trade fees* are ATROCIOUS&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; compared to some alternatives.  CDC Exchange isn&amp;amp;#39;t even available to the US yet.  US has to use the Crypto.com App, which the fees are even worse. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;th&amp;gt;Exchange&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;*Level 1 trade fees as of date of this post.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All in all, CDC is a decent platform and does a lot of good by spreading awareness about crypto, but, for the reasons above, I don‚Äôt believe it do be a great platform, nor CRO to be a great investment.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Happy hodling.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;hr/&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;EDIT:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; LOL at some of these comments.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;You&amp;amp;#39;re just a Coinbase shill!&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;You&amp;amp;#39;re just an Osmosis shill!&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;I made money with CRO so you&amp;amp;#39;re wrong!&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;You want me to use 20 different platforms?!&amp;amp;quot; -- Uh no, I&amp;amp;#39;m just giving examples.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Look... for those saying &amp;amp;quot;I&amp;amp;#39;m willing to give up some yield and pay higher trade fees for the convenience of one app&amp;amp;quot; that is a totally FAIR statement and I&amp;amp;#39;m happy that it works for you.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The point I&amp;amp;#39;m making is not against you.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;My point is against the countless threads and comments hyping up CRO as some god-tier coin that is the best and most undervalued investment on earth and going to make all the holders millionaires.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Many of you are acting like I said CDC is total garbage and sucks.  Go re-read -- I said it&amp;amp;#39;s a decent platform with excellent marketing and does good by spreading awareness... but there are better options for trading and earning yield.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;4% Coinbase card isn&amp;amp;#39;t available in my country&amp;amp;quot; -- Another fair statement, but you&amp;amp;#39;re missing my point.  Again, I&amp;amp;#39;m not saying CDC is bad, just that it&amp;amp;#39;s not the best thing in the world.  Obviously I don&amp;amp;#39;t know every debit/credit card that&amp;amp;#39;s offered in every single country, but even outside of crypto cards there are credit cards that offer 3-5% cash back/travel points and sign up bonuses worth $500-1,000 (see &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/churning&quot;&amp;gt;r/churning&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;).  If that&amp;amp;#39;s not available in your country and the CDC card is your best option, then cool, get the CDC card!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I understand you lost some money after being an &amp;amp;quot;expert&amp;amp;quot; in crypto for a year, let&amp;amp;#39;s hate on the newbies trying to figure out there way and asking questions on this subreddit. &amp;amp;quot;Hey what are you smoking bro, crack?&amp;amp;quot; You got the whole squad laughing, man. Just be a guiding hand to the newbies or can it with the harsh salty comments and criticism.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To make this platform a better space and to push people forward you need to be able to see to remove yourself from your own perspective and see it from another&amp;amp;#39;s eyes, less bias, less cult like mentality towards your favorite coins, and it&amp;amp;#39;ll be smoother for all of us.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Through support we can build a better community and some newbies here may go on to form their own startups and build the next big thing in crypto, what comes to mind when I think about supporting the community are launchpads like solanaprime that a providing a good platform for startups and support in their ventures for a change. Let&amp;amp;#39;s just be supportive and see how that plays out.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We can see you&amp;amp;#39;re trying to moon farm by making OP fall on their face, that&amp;amp;#39;s really pathetic. Be the bigger person, help them help you. That&amp;amp;#39;s my 2 cents on the matter.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What&amp;amp;#39;s really happened is that the government told every exchange in Canada to block any deposit coming from those 40 wallets. That&amp;amp;#39;s totally different than blocking a wallet.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitcoin is free and always will be.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Nobody can stop those people to use their BTC how they want. They can pay anyone they want and no government can block a transaction in the blockchain. What they can&amp;amp;#39;t do is to send btc to a Canadian exchange and to convert it to fiat. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I think most people forgot that Bitcoin was created in order to be an international currency free from any government control, and nothing changed. If people use btc just to make a profit and then convert it to fiat, that&amp;amp;#39;s not Satoshi&amp;amp;#39;s fault and not his original idea. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I don&amp;amp;#39;t sympathize with the convoy protest, I don&amp;amp;#39;t really care about it, I just don&amp;amp;#39;t like the idea that governments can control or block anyone&amp;amp;#39;s money. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If everyone would start accepting payments on btc (or any other crypto) no government could block or control the economy.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;By the way, any exchange not located in Canada could easily accept those btc because they&amp;amp;#39;re not under Canadian jurisdiction. I&amp;amp;#39;m sure Gate, Coinex, Kucoin and similar have no problems about it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Everything he wears radiates &amp;amp;quot;rich&amp;amp;quot;.
Everything cries &amp;amp;quot;show off&amp;amp;quot;.
Yet this is exactly the point.
He is coming to the camera, Fake smile of &amp;amp;quot;success&amp;amp;quot; still on his lips, and starts talking:
&amp;amp;quot;You know. I was poor (like you losers). But it didn&amp;amp;#39;t stoped me from trying. And you shouldn&amp;amp;#39;t too. Stop nagging and start trying. I am here for you guys! (Yes. It is pure altruism which drives these guys).&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He even gives away the first dose of his magical &amp;amp;quot;be rich in a month&amp;amp;quot; telegram channel for free. Just like my old neighborhood&amp;amp;#39;s dealer. Only what that dealer has sold actually worked. His magical channel gives 10 or more &amp;amp;quot;buy&amp;amp;quot; signal per day which &amp;amp;quot;magically&amp;amp;quot; around 50% of which turns out to be true! But hey! &amp;amp;quot;What is with all negativity?&amp;amp;quot; he tells his followers on Instagram. And god there are so many of them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The &amp;amp;quot;premium&amp;amp;quot; version of his telegram channel has around 100k members. Each paying around 20$ per month for subscription. Which means 2 million dollar per month just from his telegram subscribers. but that&amp;amp;#39;s not the only method of income crypto influencers have.
He just need to say &amp;amp;quot;buy (put a random shotcoin in here)&amp;amp;quot; and that shitcoin will indeed goes &amp;amp;quot;to the moon&amp;amp;quot;, Usually for few days or week before everyone panic sells. Those who made a quick buck will worship him even more and those who didn&amp;amp;#39;t, well, they should grow the fuck up and &amp;amp;quot;understand that it is all a part of the road to success&amp;amp;quot;. He is not lying tho. It is all a part of the road to success, his road.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now think about the above scenario.
Not only he can buy that coin before the pump and sell at the top, he (like most influencers) can charge a tone of money for advocating that same coin. Two birds with one stone if I ever saw one.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With that kind of cash flow, famous crypto influencers can afford an extremely luxurious and joyful life and all they need to do is to show it off on social media to attract even more cluless victims. That&amp;amp;#39;s why they love to show off their wealth so much. The message is clear.
&amp;amp;quot;You can be a winner too! You just need to follow my model.&amp;amp;quot;
It is a dream comes true for them. A dream which spells nightmare for thousands.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I always hated influencers. They are champions of a system who triumphs on making people hate themselves and their life. A system made on top of people insecurities to sell them more and more junk they don&amp;amp;#39;t need. Everything about them is fake, everything fabricated. Body, face, smile and even happiness and love.
But crypto influencers are even worst. Not only they do all the things that usual social media influencers are doing, They are literally using ponzi schemes in broad daylight to rob people who trusted them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Tldr: fuck crypto influencers. They are even worst then Kardashians.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Look, I think the Bitcoin narrative as an inflation hedge and as an institutional asset is great, especially during the massive monetary expansion that happened in 2020. But the number go up narrative is FUCKING BORING! Bitcoin is NOT a tame lion, kissing the ass of all these big institutions with the hopes of buying our bags in not in line with the Bitcoin brand. Bitcoin is a counter culture movement and the last 2 years we&amp;amp;#39;ve turned into a pro-establishment movement. Kissing the ass of all these Black Rock ESG cucks and trying to onboard all the corporates makes me puke. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m furious and disheartened to see the Canadian government move to disband patriotic protesters fighting for basic human freedom and choice.  Now Trudeau gives them the power to seize funds from crowd-funding sites &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;and banks&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; if they don&amp;amp;#39;t like what you stand for???  HOLY SHIT.  They say it&amp;amp;#39;s temporary, we shall see.  I know what I think about &amp;amp;quot;temporary emergency government measures&amp;amp;quot; based on historical context.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also, the SEC ruling over BlockFi that halts new interest accounts for any American that does not have at least $3m in investible assets is insane.  This will for sure spread to Voyager, Celsius, Gemini...etc.  I believe this is being done in coordination with banks to drive assets back to legacy institutions and prevent the ordinary person from achieving financial security and remain in a perpetual state of monetary slavery.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We are firmly in the &amp;amp;quot;..and then they fight you&amp;amp;quot; stage.  The walls are beginning to close in on ordinary citizens as their fears of being made irrelevant by this digital peaceful revolution increase.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We need truly decentralized protocols providing these type of financial services now more than ever.  Go get yourself a home mining rig for non-KYC bitcoin, spin up a full node on TOR, stack your sats like an animal, and dig in your heels.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The fight is upon us and I for one will die on the hill of financial freedom, choice, and sovereignty. I suggest you also act accordingly.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However, the FED are highly like going to have to make some real steps towards taking inflation in March.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Although a lot of those is already proced in, the extent of the damage to the economy is highly likely to mean a correction to interest rates above what was previously expected.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The CEO of the smartphone company came to the realization that Africans can afford smartphones but can&amp;amp;#39;t afford to pay for them all at once, which is why he wants to offer smartphones where you pay a larger sum at the beginning and then a monthly subscription fee. The subscription also includes a preinstalled tech stack, which will also include the Algorand Wallet. In addition, a neobank is being worked on. The neobank, which builds on Algorand, will offer a whole suite of financial products from insurance to loans. In addition, people will of course have access to the various Algorand projects such as supply chain management for farmers and so on.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The company is also working on licensing deals with other manufacturers such as Apple so that more smartphones can be offered. After one year, the smartphones will be upgraded automatically. The whole thing is to start soon in Tanzania.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/uof11fwz8zh81.png?width=2846&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e97ee0268ec502e5d8adb5a9aa93c018cdedc9ae&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/uof11fwz8zh81.png?width=2846&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e97ee0268ec502e5d8adb5a9aa93c018cdedc9ae&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then there is the fluctuation/ discrepancy with global market cap; atm CMC says the market cap is down 8% (stands at $1.72T), whereas Coingecko shows a +6% day (stands at $2.07T). $300B just disappears, only to reappear later in the day? Why does this happen? Almost every day I&amp;amp;#39;ve checked recently this has happened.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/ajag35049zh81.png?width=2846&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=5e38078c3bd2a37b41c9c9f3c18d11667d08aeaf&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/ajag35049zh81.png?width=2846&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=5e38078c3bd2a37b41c9c9f3c18d11667d08aeaf&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then there are the market cap rankings which on CMC for some reason exclude a great many from the top 100 even though their marketcaps are larger than those above them (is this opinion being injected into rankings or is this just a coding error?). The list down from the 90s to 100 is remarkably different between the two:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/2pvlt09h9zh81.png?width=2846&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=1cea6bf85b1ce6c3d0d9b2084ed2085ed3fed777&quot;&amp;gt;CMC&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/93ueas3i9zh81.png?width=2846&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=4ec4ab5f53edb30925a562f75c98f455f660fd41&quot;&amp;gt;Gecko&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then there are the rewards from collecting &amp;amp;#39;diamonds&amp;amp;#39; on CMC and the &amp;amp;#39;candies&amp;amp;#39; in Coingecko. This is a smaller quibble, but on CMC the options mainly consist of NFTs and promotions for other projects (and are mostly limited in quantity and time available), whereas Coingecko offers e-books for furthering understanding of crypto, and discount codes for VPNs and news sites (you know, something more functional than a picture of a cartoon lion) - and they don&amp;amp;#39;t appear to be limited (correct me if I&amp;amp;#39;m wrong). Of course it&amp;amp;#39;s effectively free (don&amp;amp;#39;t look a gift horse - or a DeRace NFT Horse - in the mouth, but there&amp;amp;#39;s a clear difference in tone between the two).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/3sscfdxl9zh81.png?width=2846&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=f84725a6270dcf7b8b1697b9d850d58d5cbc2284&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/3sscfdxl9zh81.png?width=2846&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=f84725a6270dcf7b8b1697b9d850d58d5cbc2284&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/5iebljnn9zh81.png?width=2846&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=043a822bd3687daef22a05b0b0f552058bc54506&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/5iebljnn9zh81.png?width=2846&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=043a822bd3687daef22a05b0b0f552058bc54506&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I guess my point is, considering CMC is the main site I see pushed for crypto rankings and info (not necessarily on this subreddit but definitely on social media in general), it falls short in multiple ways.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
