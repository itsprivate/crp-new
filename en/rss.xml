&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The QR code takes you to a screen to sign up and get $15 and/or opt in to a $3 million lottery. Those type of freebies seem like a good way to get people to sign up, but those that do will likely be pretty low volume investors. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It also took the “complexity” of cryptocurrency out of the equation which fits well with their brand. Simple.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Game developers such as UbiSoft are shoving NFTs down gamer&amp;amp;#39;s throats, and they hate it, gamers ridicule it saying it&amp;amp;#39;s the worst thing that ever happened to video games in recent history,&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Turns out Melania Trump sold her own NFT to herself to boost the price giving NFTs a bad rep,&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Majority of regular people when asked about NFTs say they are stupid, and most of them don&amp;amp;#39;t even understand what NFTs are, don&amp;amp;#39;t believe me? Ask your coworkers on Monday about what they think about NFTs,&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Even big YT channels such as Linus Tech Tips make fun of NTFs almost in every single episode of Tech Linked,&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;General population is fed up with NFTs,&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Even South Park makes fun of NFTs. If you are in a South Park episode you should know you&amp;amp;#39;ve messed up big time,&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;People use NFTs to make a quick buck congesting the networks all the time increasing fees,&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Right now we have thousands of different NFT collections and 99% of them are a worthless pieces of crap.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto space has become a laughing stock due to NFTs. It was cool and awesome when people were just buying cute meme coins for lols, but NFTs pushed it too hard and now people are fed up with them and start to hate them and start to hate the entire crypto space in general. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The biggest enemy of crypto space is the crypto space.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Change my mind.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: To clarify, the tech itself is great, but it should be used to verify medical records, house ownership, verifying votes, verifying IDs etc. but not for selling pictures of rocks. It just makes crypto space looks childish and nobody will take us seriously until a real-world use case can be provided.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I took some screenshots of generic websites. You&amp;amp;#39;re probably familiar with most of them, and searched common products. Then I simply conducted conversions to the current price of Bitcoin. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It turned into a fun activity where I was basically modifying websites to show what they could look like in the future. Of course, since they are showing the price in the current value of BTC, they will look a bit different when the world undergoes the inevitable mass adoption. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I could have chosen any crypto to do this of course, but with the takeup from some countries already, the currency of the future is more than likely to be bitcoin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is a light hearted crystal ball shill post about the best performing crypto in 2022.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Backstory: I bought Luna at $5.8 and Sol at $29 in around March 2021 and was excited to sell a couple of days later Luna at $9 and Sol at $36. You can imagine how I felt when Luna topped at $100 later in the year and Sol went to $250. Hey I made profits but FML.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The current market situation is a mix between interesting and boring as we don&amp;amp;#39;t know what will happen next. Bitcoin is going between $42-45k for a while now and can go either way imo. Let&amp;amp;#39;s hope that it will go up to the much desired $100k mark and then Lambos for everyone. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So now I have been looking at my crystal ball/glass and its empty again but it also starts speaking to me and I get the feeling that Atom and DOT is doing very well in 2022. 
CRO might also overtake Binance as the most popular trading app and if that happens, we might see another 5-6x.
Tezos is doing really well already and with all their partnerships in particular Ubisoft, this could go up big times.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What crypto are you excited about in 2022?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

So here is some history.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The 2000 SuperBowl was known as the DotCom SuperBowl - it marked the spectacular top and was followed by the crash of the entire dotcom market, sinking many of the companies that advertised there. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Super_Bowl_commercials#2000_(XXXIV)&quot;&amp;gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Super_Bowl_commercials#2000_(XXXIV)&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some of the infamous companies to advertise in 2000 SuperBowl include AutoTrader dot com, Britannica, Computer dot com, epidemic dot com, hotjobs dot com, MicroStrategy, OnMoney dot com, pets dot com etc. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Many of these companies died or ended up being acquired on the cheap by bigger entities. Even the ones that survived like MicroStrategy went through a 90% correction in asset price and had multiple decades before even beginning to recover in price. MSTR is still below its 2000 highs. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Nasdaq took 14 years, from 2000 to 2014 to recover to the same levels as the 2000 tops. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;SuperBowl advertisements dont mean jack shit. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I like to think I&amp;amp;#39;m in it for the tech, and I think most of my investments reflect that (I&amp;amp;#39;m pretty much all in on ETH at this point), but of course I&amp;amp;#39;d like to make money. And as everyone knows, the best way to make a quick buck in crypto is to flip sh*tcoins. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So here&amp;amp;#39;s my question: if I had the chance to make a 10x, but in order to do so I had to buy a token that is clearly a ponzi, would I do it?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m not talking about a project with utility that could fail ; I&amp;amp;#39;m talking about a genuine cash grab.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On one hand, I wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t feel so good about participating in this kind of operation. It&amp;amp;#39;s the kind of things that gives the entire ecosystem a bad reputation. But on the other hand... This is a free market, and if people want to throw their money at me without DYOR, then that&amp;amp;#39;d be their fault.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All things considered, I think I would not do it. But I&amp;amp;#39;ve never been tested, so it&amp;amp;#39;s easy for me to say this.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Not only can users send funds instantly and for free to any other cash app user but also to any strike user or lightning wallet on earth. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is how network effects start. Now all cash app users are compatible with all strike users and LN wallet users. Once venmo plugs into lightning all venmo users will be compatible with all cash app, strike and LN wallet users. At this point if you use any other app like paypal or transferwise or wechat or your banks online banking app you are not part of the network. You are not part of the group of people all connected to each other on lightning, and you are stuck within your one single app unable to interact with all of the people on the open lightning network. All you can do is send money to other people who happen to use the exact app you are using. Thats like only being able to send email to people who use the same email provider you use.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One by one apps plug into lightning and network effects take hold. If you don&amp;amp;#39;t offer lightning compatibility you are essentially cut off from the world.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All of a sudden 10 of the largest financial and social apps and their 2 billion users are all on the lightning network and all freely transferring money between each other instantly and at no cost. If you are a merchant do you keep only accepting visa essentially alienating anyone using any financial app? Or do you download a lightning compatible POS app so any of those 2 billion people can pay you from their app of choice. You are a business person so you figure out how those 2 billion people can pay you from whatever app they use by making sure your business POS system is lightning compatible. All of a sudden people are paying you using messenger twitter whatsapp IG venmo cashapp and strike and you no longer need to pay visas extortionate 2% transaction fees so your profit margin doubles.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Its at this point anyone accepting visa looks like a dinosaur trying to only accept checks.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This all plays out within the next 24 to 36 months.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The world is about to change for the better.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Here&amp;amp;#39;s a fact for you all, viewership of the superbowl has been consistently going down for more than a decade since 2010. So less people are watching the game in general. About half of those people are just there for the ads and a majority of them are gonna be sharing the ads on Facebook, a social media platform that didn&amp;amp;#39;t grow last period and has an aging userbase to boot. So less people and mostly older that aren&amp;amp;#39;t gonna take financial risk are watching. I doubt Auntie BJ is gonna invest in crypto because Tom Brady told them about FTX. I can see my brother who uses facebook and has no teeth left seeing the ad and wanting to FOMO in. So that&amp;amp;#39;s the audience they&amp;amp;#39;re mainly getting.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s also just Americans. No one in Europe is gonna be watching the game and or gives a shit about Tom Brady. No one in Brazil is gonna be watching. Americans are not the only people invested in crypto, most South Koreans have no idea how American football works or again, gives a shit about ads that they wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t understand without subtitles and who is gonna be writing subtitles for ads for an American sporting event outside of Spanish and English?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Lastly, why would the news care about a crypto ad? Do you expect an interview with Tom Brady breaking it down his involvement and a full history on the past year of crypto? I&amp;amp;#39;ll bet they will talk about how much is spent on the ads this year and how much FTX grew and paid Tom Brady and then move on with their day.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This idea that a single ad during an American sporting event is gonna put us into a bull run is just silly. This is Saturday Night Live or Doge day again. There&amp;amp;#39;s no reason to think prices will go up except for hope. But they wanna cover their tracks and say it&amp;amp;#39;ll affect the prices in future. Okay, I drank coffee this morning and so the prices will go back up &amp;amp;#39;someday&amp;amp;#39;, that&amp;amp;#39;s my prediction based on nothing substantial.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I wont make the same mistakes again.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Do I believe that just seeing these adverts is going to double our portfolio&amp;amp;#39;s tomorrow? No.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Do I believe that there is going to be any significant price action tomorrow? Certainly not!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Do I believe that tomorrow is going to be a focal point for the average public to talk about crypto? Yes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And what happens every time the public take an interest in crypto? The media always follow through with more reports, articles, predictions etc and the larger investor, realising that the public are likely to start FOMOing in buy up the lower price quickly. And the more attention crypto gets the harder retail predictably starts FOMOing in which causes a feedback loop pushing prices sky high until large investor money swoops out of the market and crashes the price again.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So from the charts tomorrow will look like any other day but looking back from the future I bet my sats that it is the beginning of a significant upswing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

They &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;manage over $10 trillion in assets&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; via public pension schemes, family funds, endowments, and sovereign wealth funds. BlackRock also owns 16.3% of MicroStrategy.         &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While this type of adoption allows giant whales to borrow from BlackRock pledging crypto assets as collateral, similar to how Wall Street banks and large financial institutions like Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Citi are creeping into cryptocurrencies, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;best believe these legacy financial institutions do not have our best DeFi interests at heart.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;         &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They are forcing other sea creature from us small shrimp to large fish and sharks to compete with their crypto allocations. They know what will make them money and it’s make us believe we need their services. &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Tldr; You don’t want these giant centralized powers controlling your cryptocurrency.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I’m working on a project that can bring more transparency to blockchain projects and their development. Blockchain development is usually done in an open-sourced way, where anyone can see what developers are working on. But this information is usually only accessible to people who are developers themselves. Browsing a git repository, trying to understand what a commit, branch, or tag does is not really understandable for most non-developers. With the tool I&amp;amp;#39;m developing I&amp;amp;#39;m planning to shed a bit of light on what teams are doing and how the projects are progressing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In this post, I&amp;amp;#39;d like to go over some of the metrics I&amp;amp;#39;ve found interesting on different blockchains and how they can be used to understand the development of a project. All of the results I describe here are based on the tool I&amp;amp;#39;ve written and my personal experience in software development. Someone else with a different background might interpret the results differently.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m filtering out changes with more than 1000 lines and less than 100 lines. In my opinion, outside of this range, there is too much noise to be useful. I&amp;amp;#39;m also just inspecting the block producer code. In the next iterations, I&amp;amp;#39;ll take a look into entire organizations with all repositories. Let&amp;amp;#39;s start with bitcoin itself.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/6pya36ib4eh81.png?width=2062&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=c6141e3f03eeae7bcdd4c47d91d6fafb0932a3ee&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/6pya36ib4eh81.png?width=2062&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=c6141e3f03eeae7bcdd4c47d91d6fafb0932a3ee&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;From the executive summary, I can see that ~9 % of the contributors who contribute to bitcoin are still onboard. But on the knowledge retention, we can see that some of the &amp;amp;quot;heavy hitters&amp;amp;quot; have left the project. Usually, this number starts at 100% for new projects and slowly decreases. Knowledge retention is a measure of how many lines of code which was edited by a certain contributor and if that contributor is still on-board. Remember that bitcoin had this block size war at some point, so it&amp;amp;#39;s normal to see some of the developers who contributed to bitcoin leave the project. Having a refactoring rate of ~60 % means that more than half of its codebase is re-written. And it&amp;amp;#39;s more or less in normal bounds.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/38njz74c4eh81.png?width=2062&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=ad3d07018d264085068778f2022b4b97341c146f&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/38njz74c4eh81.png?width=2062&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=ad3d07018d264085068778f2022b4b97341c146f&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Looking at the versions chart, it shows a steady and continuous development. If we look at some of the latest large updates, we can see that they are mostly rewrites. Of course, it&amp;amp;#39;s necessary to check more messages to get a better understanding but I want to leave it to users.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Let&amp;amp;#39;s move on to the Ethereum project.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/jsn1lk4f4eh81.png?width=2048&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=7c882e71a3536ff20e0c00b13047aa06f2a08706&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/jsn1lk4f4eh81.png?width=2048&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=7c882e71a3536ff20e0c00b13047aa06f2a08706&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Ethereum shows worse results in the executive summary than bitcoin. This is quite surprising to me because Ethereum is a younger project than bitcoin. Yet the constant delays in their releases and always changing targets and deadlines, it seems like the metrics make sense. Only 7% of the contributors are still onboard, and the onboarded contributors only contributed 0.39% of the total changes. I would expect the new teams to re-do the same mistakes that previous teams did or re-write the same code again to understand it easier. I think a 60% refactoring rate is what we can assume to be generally good. But lower numbers would probably mean that projects are adding features faster than Ethereum and Bitcoin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/bpco6j3g4eh81.png?width=2042&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=b781d229af8621c5471440878ba73351fc7255c5&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/bpco6j3g4eh81.png?width=2042&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=b781d229af8621c5471440878ba73351fc7255c5&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On the versions chart, last month seems like getting a bit more silent in Ethereum miner development. But keep in mind, this data is only from go-ethereum project, maybe the team might have their focus on some other repository nowadays.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now Solana.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/3vi6799h4eh81.png?width=2074&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=7e20865a1b620ca2b690a7c30e056f24b5d56f11&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/3vi6799h4eh81.png?width=2074&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=7e20865a1b620ca2b690a7c30e056f24b5d56f11&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Solana shows better results in the executive summary than Ethereum. But because Solana is a much younger project, higher team and knowledge retention is expected. This will result in faster deliveries and more features. But it&amp;amp;#39;s important to check this measure from time to time to see if they start bleeding talent.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/mjrzaj6i4eh81.png?width=2040&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=70046d0077a79310d5af93032f20d65be504dcaf&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/mjrzaj6i4eh81.png?width=2040&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=70046d0077a79310d5af93032f20d65be504dcaf&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Looking at the versions chart, we can see that there is constant development with more systematic changes which would be expected from an &amp;amp;quot;industry like development&amp;amp;quot; project with focused teams and serious project management. In a commit message from 2019, we can see that they were already trying to offload some work to GPU&amp;amp;#39;s from start. Yet I&amp;amp;#39;m curious what other changes are done in the subject, so I&amp;amp;#39;m going to search for updates with GPU messages in them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/tm9b8uij4eh81.png?width=2048&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=d6a35ae9ed4410f0612f2405b4ef2c9c65e356b4&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/tm9b8uij4eh81.png?width=2048&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=d6a35ae9ed4410f0612f2405b4ef2c9c65e356b4&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hmm, interestingly it seems like there is not much development being done with GPU term in the message.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Ok now let&amp;amp;#39;s move on to EOS.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/06x71zdk4eh81.png?width=2040&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=d1516662b8182f6eaddde966e2b628c344479e1e&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/06x71zdk4eh81.png?width=2040&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=d1516662b8182f6eaddde966e2b628c344479e1e&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m putting it here as it verifies the data I have. EOS is an old project which is riddled with issues. The executive summary shows that ~0% of the contributors are still onboard. This means no one is contributing to the project systematically anymore for 90 days. This is a very interesting metric to look at because it&amp;amp;#39;s really hard to onboard people back onto a codebase as complicated as EOS.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/qhan02al4eh81.png?width=2042&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=ef1af6b99d17370e3c76906b9fcd78f2774735a5&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/qhan02al4eh81.png?width=2042&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=ef1af6b99d17370e3c76906b9fcd78f2774735a5&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the versions chart, we can see that there is a sudden drop in the development NOV 2020. Afterward, it seems like it&amp;amp;#39;s completely stopped in MAY 2021(the chart of EOS ends here, not today). Of course, there might be some changes happening, but our filters are filtering them out, with these settings.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I think that&amp;amp;#39;s enough for now, I&amp;amp;#39;ll be updating the tool with the new data I find and I&amp;amp;#39;ll be adding more metrics. In the next weeks, I&amp;amp;#39;ll set up a notification system where users can get e-mails or push notifications when certain filter results bring new data. ex, you can subscribe to GPU updates on Solana and you&amp;amp;#39;ll get an e-mail when there is a new update.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you&amp;amp;#39;d like to access the tool while I&amp;amp;#39;m developing it, you can subscribe to my Patreon(&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.patreon.com/gkaykck&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.patreon.com/gkaykck&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;) and get an access link to the tool. After you get the access link, you are free to share it with friends if you&amp;amp;#39;d like, but I will update the key from time to time and post a new key on my Patreon page only to subscribers. So you can make your friends beg you for the new link :). But keep in mind that the application is really resource intensive and expensive to host as it&amp;amp;#39;s scanning through many gigabytes of data on every filter change. So I would ask you to not publish the access link on any online forums, the application can become unusable until the next key change.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Currently, you can inspect the following blockchain miners with the application;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

CRO or FTX?&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But viewers are complaining, there is just too much sports between the commericals. &amp;amp;quot;I wanna see my ad, not some guys throwing around a ball, i mean, the spirit of football is to represent a neoliberal capitalist view, why do we need this childish men on the field between our proud american ads?&amp;amp;quot;, one fan from New York adds.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The crypto space took over the super bowl this year. &amp;amp;quot;Which means, we have to adapt our play to make sure our sponsors are happy&amp;amp;quot;, says an anonymous Quarterback. &amp;amp;quot;Before we pass the ball to another player, we need to pay gas fees, i hope my salary is enough for that eth...?&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Further proof that money doesn&amp;amp;#39;t buy style... &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Want some backstory? You ain&amp;amp;#39;t alone&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; - Jack joined Safemoon in April as their Chief Operations Officer and was often seen alongside the CEO, spinning a vast web of bullshit while the devoted&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;TM&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; threw in tens of thousands of dollars while Safemoon&amp;amp;#39;s market valuation performed a triple-salchow off the 10m diving board straight down to the gutter of the all-time-lows where it&amp;amp;#39;s currently been wallowing like a sickly pig.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As to what Jack &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;actually did&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, well that&amp;amp;#39;s more difficult. I&amp;amp;#39;d like to think he was there to produce an air of legitimacy to the project but even that&amp;amp;#39;s a bit of a stretch, considering his previous employment had him working as a... &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;checks notes&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;... oh yes, a part-time DJ, no-name Twitch Streamer and he ran the twitter account of Ben Philips, some influencer dude.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;hr/&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;hr/&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;But what&amp;amp;#39;s the &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;real&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; story here?&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;hr/&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;hr/&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I think if people make money off Crypto, that&amp;amp;#39;s fair play. Less so when it&amp;amp;#39;s by stringing along Investors by promising them wealth while delivering products you know are broken (Safemoon wallet released under his watch!)  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But that all goes out the window when these people repeatedly claimed they didn&amp;amp;#39;t own any Safemoon. So when someone who worked as a part-time DJ suddenly comes into dramatic wealth, it does raise &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;some&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; red-flags, especially when they have gone on record over multiple AMA&amp;amp;#39;s saying none of the devs are the whale wallets cashing out millions of dollars at a time...  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And this behaviour came directly after &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://i.redd.it/86u7kvgknom71.jpg&quot;&amp;gt;handing in his notice&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; for &amp;amp;quot;toxicity&amp;amp;quot; reasons (perhaps the investors he strung along for 5 months were getting a bit rowdy?)  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Toxicity is a weird way to say &amp;amp;quot;Dumping the bags we claimed we never owned&amp;amp;quot;, but, whatever.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Just another shitcoin story.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
