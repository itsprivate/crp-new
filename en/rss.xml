People were happy and euphoric. The only complaint and the big one was to have bought more. Then we go to end of Nov and the first people started calling for a 80% dip so that they can load up.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Where are those people now? Well they are probably too scared right now and the majority likely already left the market in January of this year or so. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s easy to call for a 80% dip but it&amp;amp;#39;s hard to stay for it. The dip won&amp;amp;#39;t be sharp down on one day and sharp up the next one. For most altcoins it will be a question of survival.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I DCA every week and my averages are looking awesome, even if my overall value is down over the past 6 months. When I first got into crypto I treaded a little too lightly and didn&amp;amp;#39;t invest what I should have. Now we are on the cusp of rolling back some of these crypto values several years and I feel like my second chance is coming. Barring a societal collapse from which we never recover, I look forward to some steep economic declines if it means I can buy up a lot of crypto for way less fiat. Have I completely lost it or is anyone else on the same page as me as far as this potentially being a huge buying opportunity? I don&amp;amp;#39;t know about you boys, but I&amp;amp;#39;m stacking up like a mad man right now.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Don&amp;amp;#39;t hurt yourself for mindlessly buying.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Of course everyone is just afraid they&amp;amp;#39;ll be a bag holder, so the initial reaction would be to save themselves, and how? By making other people buy to protect the prices. Well to be honest, this sub can&amp;amp;#39;t even push the prices up anyway  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This might even go downhill even further. It&amp;amp;#39;s a massive dump in a span of 3 days.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;BTC is down almost down 10%&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;ETH is down &amp;amp;gt;15%&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Most alts I&amp;amp;#39;m watchin are at least 10-20% down&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It could very well go down further. Don&amp;amp;#39;t catch falling knives. Just &amp;amp;quot;zooming out&amp;amp;quot; on the daily candles on the BTC chart, we&amp;amp;#39;re obviously in a downtrend for months now, you don&amp;amp;#39;t need to draw lines or use indicators to realize that.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Of course I could be wrong too and I would definitely happy to be proven wrong since I myself just made my regular DCA purchase yesterday, but at this time, this is the most reasonable advice I can think of.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Just follow your schedule if you&amp;amp;#39;re dca-ing. Buying in bulk now will just hurt your average.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This might as well a warning and note to myself cause I&amp;amp;#39;m damned tempted to buy some off of my schedule.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Of course, everyone knows the  best time for crypto is when we are in a bull run but that has its cons ( see above), but at least in these bear times the community is more quiet and focused on the real things behind crypto and not full of shitcoin advertising and promoting.

This system also has a possibility of peg/depeg.   Now stEth=Eth, but if the depeg happens and stEth becomes cheaper than Eth, the situation will go out of control.&amp;amp;quot; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s already happening. There is a 4-5% discount for sETH that is supposed to be &amp;amp;quot;secured by ether&amp;amp;quot; in one-to-one ratio. Panic in the secondary market    &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;CelsiusNetwork liquidity is decreasing. There is fewer and fewer funds available to pay back investors who are buying out positions. They have $1.5b of requests   &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/highrisk_henny/status/1535268210986995713?s=21&amp;amp;amp;t=jF_SMcO2VRcuybDXkARdLA&quot;&amp;gt;https://twitter.com/highrisk_henny/status/1535268210986995713?s=21&amp;amp;amp;t=jF_SMcO2VRcuybDXkARdLA…&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;  This “game” has all the big players involved from   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Binance  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;to   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/a16z&quot;&amp;gt;@a16z&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/g8e1bo8lx0591.png?width=685&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=61616a50a479767d64ce8bb4b2274987d3ba77d2&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/g8e1bo8lx0591.png?width=685&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=61616a50a479767d64ce8bb4b2274987d3ba77d2&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also, the lack of liquidity arose thanks to several hacks: The first hack happened in May 2021, where 35,000 ETH was lost – worth $70 million. The second loss was on December 1, 2021, after the BadgerDao exploit, where he stored his 896 BTC, worth $54 million Celsius. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On top of that, Celsius had a &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%24LUNA&amp;amp;amp;src=cashtag_click&quot;&amp;gt;$LUNA&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;/$UST deposit, at Anchor, for $500 million. The total loss was $624 million and, importantly, it was client money for which Celsius was responsible. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also, the lack of liquidity arose thanks to several hacks: The first hack happened in May 2021, where 35,000 ETH was lost – worth $70 million. The second loss is on December 1, 2021, after the BadgerDao exploit, where he stored his 896 BTC – worth $54 million Celsius. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After all these losses and hacks, the battered Celsius turns on the HODL mode for its users, thereby delaying the withdrawal of deposits, since now the project does not have enough liquidity to pay off everyone. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To solve its liquidity problem, Celsius went into debt in May 2022, borrowing $76.7 million in &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%24USDC&amp;amp;amp;src=cashtag_click&quot;&amp;gt;$USDC&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and $18.3 million in Compound to pay back its clients. However, he realized that there would not be enough money to pay everyone, and now, presumably &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He can choose two scenarios for the development of events: Option 1 is to sell your stETH for ETH and exchange ETH for stables. Option 2 - use stETH as collateral for stables. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If we assume the implementation of the 1st option, then there will not be enough liquidity in the Curve pool at the moment to exchange all stETH for ETH, since the pool is getting more and more depleted with each sale. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But let&amp;amp;#39;s not forget that Celsius already has $1.2 billion in debt to AVVE, along with $2.5 billion of &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%24stETH&amp;amp;amp;src=cashtag_click&quot;&amp;gt;$stETH&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; collateral. And, if market conditions suddenly deteriorate and stETH collapses then the $2.5 billion collateral will be liquidated, putting Celsius in an even riskier position to lose everything. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Do kwon was a paper billionaire with no way to cash out without causing a depeg. Heres how he used degenbox to cash out into usdt/usdc&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Lets start with what degenbox is: a borrowing protocol where people can loop stablecoin buys. You can stake collateral to buy UST, put it into Anchor, then use your aUST to borrow more UST, put it into Anchor again... You get the drill. It&amp;amp;#39;s Anchor on steroids. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Terra influencers shilled this strategy en masse, and thousands of retail users began flooding into Degenbox to access the high yields.  This created incredibly thick, near-immovable liquidity near the top of the peg zone (the $0.98 to $1.00 range). In a nutshell, it would allow for someone to cash out billions of UST for MIM at a 1:1 rate without disturbing the peg - all thanks to inorganic demand. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here&amp;amp;#39;s the total amount of MIM Do Kwon was able to cash out through the MIM/UST pool - without even moving the peg! $2,719,132,772.01, to do with what he pleases. No need to dump LUNA or sell UST on exchanges - he drummed up liquidity from all of you. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/17acssrn40591.png?width=572&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=79356b83aef142fd546bcf33972658175e3050f1&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/17acssrn40591.png?width=572&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=79356b83aef142fd546bcf33972658175e3050f1&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;UST is the future, he said. Decentralized money is sound money, he said. UST won&amp;amp;#39;t depeg, he told you. &amp;amp;#39;Centralized stablecoins will rug you eventually.&amp;amp;#39; So why did he cash out $2.7b from UST into USDT and USDC? Were all those words just lies? (Spoiler: yes.) &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/lnqogfqt40591.png?width=850&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e93885ed51bdb66e654f912358d6ff5b98688263&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/lnqogfqt40591.png?width=850&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e93885ed51bdb66e654f912358d6ff5b98688263&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here are TFL&amp;amp;#39;s outflows. $558m to KuCoin, $1.08b to Binance, $545m to Huobi - you get the gist. Ultimately, all of this money is liquidity being removed from the Terra ecosystem, exacerbating the collapse, bolstering TFL coffers - all while they lied to your face.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A more academic version of the article on the Nasdaq with links to sources, instead of like the previous link that more so tries to use imagery to better relay the message: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bitcoin-fixes-the-modern-fiat-ponzi-scheme-2021-09-14&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bitcoin-fixes-the-modern-fiat-ponzi-scheme-2021-09-14&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s sad that people don&amp;amp;#39;t see this yet, but Bitcoin has started a fascinating trend that leads people down a rabbit whole of financial education that allows them to see this fiat Ponzi and Securities Pyramid scheme for the scans they are. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We only have a few hundred million people today in this space, and I&amp;amp;#39;d say only a few tens of millions have been in it long enough learning about it, to better comprehend the giant scam with extra steps that is the traditional financial system. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What happens in 4 years when we&amp;amp;#39;re projecting over a billion users, and likely by then a few hundred million users who&amp;amp;#39;ve learned enough about the financial system to understand the scam that it is? Will we get the revolution over night that Henry Ford prophesized?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If not then, then what happens in 10 years when we project 5+ billion users with a few billions having learned enough to better understand the Fiat Ponzi and Securities Pyramid scams with extra steps?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you&amp;amp;#39;re a long time hodler then you already know what happens. Eventually your banks fails you as they do everyone all the time, and Bitcoin offers you a work around. After that, things become much clearer seeing how Bitcoin can do for you everything your bank does for you without all the inefficiency&amp;amp;#39;s. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Even getting loans against your Bitcoin is an easier process with better rates than a banking loan, and anyone who&amp;amp;#39;s been in long enough to start doing that has learned enough to only ever do it with the smallest portion of their holdings to not be at risk of not having more Bitcoin in reserves to cover a margin call.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;F.A. Hayek&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; once said:  &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-uo-KfnkhI&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;I don&amp;amp;#39;t believe we shall ever have a good money again before we take the thing out of the hands of government, that is, we can&amp;amp;#39;t take them violently out of the hands of government, all we can do is by some sly roundabout way introduce something that they can&amp;amp;#39;t stop.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So tell me, what happens in 20 years when 7+ billions of people are projected to be using Bitcoin like people have grown to use email today, and even more billions having learned enough from their curiosity in it to see the old financial system for the giant convoluted scam that it is? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitcoin&amp;amp;#39;s adoption rate has held strong for 13 years, and for those thirteen years it has grown at twice the speed of the first internet.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you study what happens to adoptees after they start studying Bitcoin and the financial system, to better understand why Bitcoin goes up in value over time like it does,  then you know the usual result is we Hodlers start denominating everything in Bitcoin, saving in Bitcoin. And dollars and other fiat currencies? Well we keep as few those as we need. Hell the oldest of us in this space don&amp;amp;#39;t keep any dollars anymore. We have credit and debit cards that we can pay with our Bitcoin so we never have to touch that fiat shit again.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If global recession does happen, that means we will see crypto market drop significantly more. And I am not talking just about the crypto market, but economy as a whole. There won&amp;amp;#39;t be extra money to buy crypto, stocks and other stuff some people were planning on buying. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We could say that S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 is commonly used to benchmark for determining the state of overall economy. Why does that matter? Bitcoin&amp;amp;#39;s correlation to S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 is 0.9, this is almost perfect correlation. (1 is considered perfect correlation and -1 the complete opposite), simply put bitcoin follows S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 and if whole economy drops so will bitcoin and usually, then the alts follow and on and on. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Whatever happens, you should be prepared. I am not a fan of exact dates that crash can happen. But I am confident that the true crash will happen sometime in 2022. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;People are selling their investments and transferring them back into fiat, just so they can afford everyday needs. Rent is higher. Gas prices are way up. Everything is rising. Not to mention other stuff that is ongoing right now. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;___&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;fyi : s&amp;amp;amp;p500 is following the same pattern as in 2008 when the financial crisis happend, and its not just housing market this time, it&amp;amp;#39;s everything; just info, I&amp;amp;#39;m not much of a fan of TA myself. But thought I&amp;amp;#39;d put it out and maybe some people who like technical analysis can do their research&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;___&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;tl;dr : Inflation reached 8.6% highest the U.S has seen in last 40 years. True crash might just be around the corner.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The United States Securities and Exchange Commission reportedly discovered a situation where $80 million dollars (100 billion won) of the company’s funds every month were sent to different wallets for the operating expense. This reportedly happened a few months before the collapse of Terra. This particular activity, according to the reports, is what raised money laundering suspicions about Do Kwon.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If the allegations are true then it seems like Terra the shitshow created by Do Kwon is an ending rabbit hole. Now it&amp;amp;#39;s getting more clear why he ignored all the warnings about the potential loopholes, he was himself exploiting them. How low this disgusting excuse for an human being can go is yet to be discovered.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you dig into these incidences, it seems all of them were halted after discussions on discord groups by the validators of the chain and all of them arrived at the conclusion that given the situation its better to halt the chain till the issues are ironed out. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How can these kind of validators be expected to keep a chain up if governments of the day decide it is required to shut the chain down? They wont, they will fold immediately. The effort required by a government agency to shut these chains down will be minimal.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Look, I&amp;amp;#39;ve been an ADA bag holder for a while now, but this is just petty at this point. Literally no reason to believe Charles has any inside info and is doing anything other than taking a (poorly-timed) shot at his old colleagues. I believe in ADA tech-wise, but as long as Charles is the face of the coin, I think it&amp;amp;#39;s more likely to go the way of LUNA and Do Kwon than a viable ETH competitor. If I can get back to even on my ADA, I&amp;amp;#39;m selling. I can&amp;amp;#39;t handle this guy anymore.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anybody got a defense for this?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
