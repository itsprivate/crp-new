&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But is this the place where you need to shill your favourite political party and share the same overused &amp;amp;quot;this party bad, this party good&amp;amp;quot; rhetorics? No. There are so many of us that don&amp;amp;#39;t give an absolute donkey&amp;amp;#39;s ass about why you think one party is better than the other. They are both awful and you&amp;amp;#39;re kidding yourself if you think &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;either&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; of them has you or your favourite crypto&amp;amp;#39;s best interest in mind.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;By all means, it is important that many of these topics within the political sphere are discussed and opposed when they threaten the future of our financial independence, freedom of information, etc.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But really, it gets old fast when you all inject your political views into things. If you&amp;amp;#39;re going to constantly look for reasons to hate on a political party,  but not actually address the underlying REASONS both parties are equally corrupt when discussing crypto, you&amp;amp;#39;re not helping the issue, you&amp;amp;#39;re &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;part&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; of it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;PAC = Political Action Committee, the means with which the wealthy and powerful get representation (or cough, cough, BRIBE) our politicians to do their will.  We definitely need some crypto representation because of bills like the current &amp;amp;quot;America Competes&amp;amp;quot; Bill, which has a provision giving the Treasury Secretary complete power to just unilaterally declare crypto illegal in the US. What do you think of a Crypto PAC, and is Charles Hoskinson a good choice to start one up?    &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Just another bought politician sneaking in a &amp;amp;quot;small&amp;amp;quot; hidden provision in a large bill.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto lobbying groups are worried about a specific provision proposed by Rep. Jim Himes, buried around page 1,482 of the almost-3,000-page bill, that would allow the Treasury Department to bypass certain checks to take &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/5318A&quot;&amp;gt;“special measures”&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; to surveil, condition or prohibit any transactions deemed of concern to U.S. interests. The provision, titled “Prohibitions or Conditions on Certain Transmittal of Funds,” also expands the department’s authority to include crypto exchanges and transactions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So these CBDC&amp;amp;#39;s will be really bad news.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I went through the last proposal so you didn&amp;amp;#39;t have to.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TLDR:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In short, they want unilateral power over money and to maintain control of global economies. They also fear Russia China and others are using crypto to skirt sanctions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They want complete control to spy and freeze funds in everyones accounts&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;edit clarification: the top are screenshots from the CBDC proposal, they are eerily similar to the America Competes law listed below. One can deduce that with the power and flexibility of CBDC&amp;amp;#39;s they will give the treasury unilateral power&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you stack this with the  America COMPETES Act of 2022 which gives the TReasury &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;unchecked and unilateral power to spy and halt or limit accounts and transactions.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here are some screen shots&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The following are from the CBDC proposal: compare them to the screen shots below&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;FED NOW is a service that directly competes with XRP and will also be wholly controlled by the Federal reserve&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;here is a link references Russia investing in BTC to get around sanctions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Lastly Biden will be using an executive order to provision and issue crypto rules next month&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This will be done under the banner of national security&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.barrons.com/articles/white-house-executive-action-regulate-cryptos-national-security-51643312454&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.barrons.com/articles/white-house-executive-action-regulate-cryptos-national-security-51643312454&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;An executive order is a signed, written, and published directive from the President of the United States that manages operations of the federal government.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Executive orders are not legislation; they require no approval from Congress, and Congress cannot simply overturn them. Congress may pass legislation that might make it difficult, or even impossible, to carry out the order, such as removing funding. Only a sitting U.S. President may overturn an existing executive order by issuing another executive order to that effect.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.americanbar.org/groups/public_education/publications/teaching-legal-docs/what-is-an-executive-order-/&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.americanbar.org/groups/public_education/publications/teaching-legal-docs/what-is-an-executive-order-/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Personally I hope this goes all the way to the Supreme court as this is a gross violation of the 4th amendment &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects,&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#cite_note-2&quot;&amp;gt;[a]&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#cite_note-3&quot;&amp;gt;[2]&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How can the spot ETF suffer from manipulation risk when the SEC themselves allowed the futures ETF which according to them doesnt suffer from manipulation? Both of them are the same market. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Lets say US retail and institutions, who the SEC wants to protect, have invested in BITO.. and over the weekend when BITO isn&amp;amp;#39;t traded, someone unknown to the market borrows a ton of money and also dumps million BTC on Bitfinex and crashes the price. Manipulation.. probably? But it doesn&amp;amp;#39;t make BITO free from manipulation, on Monday when it trades, BITO will just follow the spot price and dumps as well.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Even BITO would be manipulated.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So manipulation in spot - the SEC must protect, but manipulation in CME futures as a result of spot manipulation is fine? How does it even make sense?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Manipulation&amp;amp;quot; bs is just a big smokescreen to hide what the SEC really wants.. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The real reason is that the SEC wants to control and exert authority over spot exchanges. Thats what DADDY gensler wants, and this is all soft power play from a corrupt regulator acting in his own interest, not in the interest of the people. Spot exchanges unless they are trading securities are not under the purview of the SECURITIES exchange commission. Bitcoin is not a security, and does not fall under SEC&amp;amp;quot;s purview under any stretch of mental gymnastics. Bitcoin futures have already been held as commodities. It literally makes zero sense that CFTC regulates Bitcoin futures, but SEC regulates spot. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yet, the SEC is trying to arm twist both the people and Congress to give regulatory authority over spot exchanges to the SEC. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A regulator must act in the interests of the people, not in the interest of the office. A regulator cant make power play so that the regulator gets more authority from Congress.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Imagine if the last mile electricity supply company cut off power supply to the city because they dont have the authority to fix prices? Everyone would be up in arms.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Recent news about Cardano congestion shooting up around 90% and more, Polygon being borderline unresponsive during Sunflower popularity/incident, and AVAX fees getting sky high while network suffered congestion a few months ago.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If these networks had the Ethereum levels of activitynon them, they wouldnt hold for long. Cardano has a handful of dapps and its already clogged? Same with Polygon. 1 dapp putting whole network on stop is really not what people would expect of the so called &amp;amp;quot;next gen eth competitors.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While I 100% agree that gas fees on Ethereum are absurd, I wonder if the alternatives that we have at the moment in top10 are going to solve that.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Not a great writer&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So yeah this does exist and you can go to jail for trading/holding cryptocurrency. You maybe wondering which country it is. It&amp;amp;#39;s located in South East Asia called Nepal. I&amp;amp;#39;ve been into crypto space for almost a two year now and it&amp;amp;#39;s like living in the future. Recently Three people got arrested and four member of the same family got arrested for trading cryptocurrency. Kudos to those who got arrested. May satoshi be with you. Fuck this country man so tired of this fucking government fuck the system. I&amp;amp;#39;m so frustated and deperessed reading these types of news warning about cryptocurrency. The government doesnot give a fuck about development it&amp;amp;#39;s all corrupted from the root. I want to keep a low profile now but fuck man talk about freedom nothing like this actually exist we are just bind by the shitty rules made by government. kudos to those who live in a country where you can hold and trade cryptos freely and can experience financial freedom. I have huge respect for those country. I want to get out of this shithole country and do what I want freely. So yeah good bye to the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/CC&quot;&amp;gt;r/CC&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; community but I&amp;amp;#39;ll be back when they make crypto Legal or meet a point where I don&amp;amp;#39;t give a fuck and keep trading and holding crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The co-founder of troubled cryptocurrency exchange QuadrigaCX is a convicted felon who served time in the United States for his role in an online identity-theft ring.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Michael Patryn helped launch Quadriga’s trading platform in 2013 alongside Gerald Cotten. The company has come under intense scrutiny since Mr. Cotten, its chief executive, died at the age of 30 from complications of Crohn’s disease while on his honeymoon in India last December, leaving the exchange’s users unable to access $250-million in cash and cryptocurrency.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Every month, 50% of Moons burned are meant to be reintroduced in the following distribution, but because of a bug in the contract this has not been happening as expected. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We have deployed an update to the smart contracts to fix the distributions going forward (it won’t apply to this current round but will apply to future rounds after this one). &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For those interested, here are the details from the team for what happened: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://testnet.redditspace.com/address/0x22037C488520DF547c2cd2AA0BE70517082BDA1C/contracts&quot;&amp;gt;buggy Distributions Contract&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; on lines 1705 - 1708, we are adding the Points totalSupply from the previous round to the number of Points claimed in the previous round.  If that total is less than the current Points totalSupply, then that means points were burned (less points exist now than were minted).  However, this code has a bug where it does not account for the Points issued to the SharedOwners.   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is fixed in the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://testnet.redditspace.com/address/0x255b868d0C13C45123085cb574218667433C7E4b/contracts&quot;&amp;gt;updated Distributions Contract&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; lines 1701 &amp;amp;amp; 1747 by keeping track of the Points issued to the SharedOwners in the previous round, and including them in the count of total Points issued for the previous round.  This fix requires 1 distribution round to start working, so burned points will start being reintroduced in the Round 23 distribution.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;***&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This distribution of Moons has been finalized, and Moons are being delivered to users with a registered Vault. Users who do not have a Vault yet will get their Moons when they create one through the Reddit app.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This distribution is based on karma earned from 2021-12-22 to 2022-01-18. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://reddit-meta-production.s3.amazonaws.com/distribution/publish/CryptoCurrency/round_22_finalized.csv&quot;&amp;gt;Here&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; is the finalized list, with contribution scores signed by Reddit.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Moons are &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/CryptoCurrency&quot;&amp;gt;r/CryptoCurrency&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#39;s form of &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://reddit.com/community-points&quot;&amp;gt;Community Points&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, a way for users to be rewarded for their contributions to the subreddit, and they can be used on premium features in the community.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

When I first landed it felt hot, lovely. Had to wait for a friend so I grabbed the rental car, where they try and scam you for insurance, and went for a coffee. Friend arrived and we drove to El Zonte a.k.a Bitcoin Beach.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The drive we thought we were going to be shot, not sure why but you hear stories. We didn’t get shot. Checked in the Airbnb no probs, no hot water though.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Next day we drive to the beach for coffee and bump straight into Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert, said hi, Stacy was nice but Max was not interested, I probably wouldn’t be to be fair, especially when I’m after a coffee.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitcoin signs everywhere, talked to a bunch of people and some knew about bitcoin but mostly not, felt like just a lot of travellers there passing through. I think all the stuff you see online you assume everyone is walking around with Chivo wallets but it doesn’t seem to be the case, maybe other places it’s like that but not here.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We contacted some estate/realtor agents and saw two properties just to see what’s available, this place literally has nothing, when I say nothing I mean you’ll need to put water in, electricity, it’s so behind the times that most people here live in tin shacks by the road/river. It seems that there’s chancers there trying their luck to get bitcoiners to buy shacks but there really isn’t any point… the reality is you can’t either, not straight forward anyway as you’ll need a lawyer and even if you buy something you’re not 100% sure you own it, it’s confusing, plus the government has some rule where they can take property off people.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My thoughts are this won’t be the future of Bitcoin, it’s so behind the times. The people were lovely, beautiful scenery, great weather but realistically this place will take 20 years to develop and in the next couple of years there will most likely be other countries adopting Bitcoin, countries which are already developed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;El Salvador is definitely cool and will probably the Mecca/pilgrimage place for the future of where it all started to be accepted but I can’t see it being anything but that. I actually hope I’m wrong because it was first and deserves so much more but after visiting and seeing how undeveloped it is I’d be very surprised if people actually go there.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If anyone has been to San Salvador and people are daily using their Chivo wallets then please comment, I hope there is more use of it as I read millions of people have them but whether they’re active accounts would be interesting to know.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The last thing I want to say is this trip has made me realise how truly early we are still… one place is using Bitcoin and it’s underdeveloped. I can’t imagine what Bitcoin will be like when everyone is using it… it blows my mind! It’s so early.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Ah yes, the holidays. A time for feasting, partying, reconnecting, and yes, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;financial advice&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. After being in crypto for a few years, I decided this holiday season was the time I would finally come out of the crypto closet to my family. I told them about the fundamentals of DeFi. I told them about specific projects I am invested in. I suggested to them to invest also.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Well, some of them did invest, and they’ve been staring at the same red dildos for the past month as the rest of us. Having bought in before the crash and with no bear market experience, some of them even sold at a loss. Tbh I think they aped with all their holiday checks and a few months savings.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The other half who didn’t buy refrained from doing so because they think I’m an idiot for buying crypto. It’s fair to say they think I’m more of an idiot now.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TL/DR: The half of my family who bought in wants to burn my house down, and the other half thinks I’m a clown with my magic internet money. Hooray for me.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I would expect Reddit to be equally if not more supportive of crypto than the general public or that I might expect to see from say in a comments section on Yahoo News, however when I see Bitcoin or Crypto mentioned in more mainstream Reddit subs like &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/news&quot;&amp;gt;r/news&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; or others everyone seems to be talking shit about &amp;amp;quot;crypto bros&amp;amp;quot; or making references to Beanie Babies, its kind of crazy to me as Reddit tends to sku younger and be very tech friendly. Here&amp;amp;#39;s some of the types of comments I&amp;amp;#39;m talking about and these are like handpicked comments this sentiment seems to be the majority.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Looks like Cryptobros will have to go back to Amway.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Pyramid scheme&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Anyone who thinks the world&amp;amp;#39;s governments and central banks are going to allow unregulated virtual currency to take over is dillusional.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;&amp;amp;quot;Let&amp;amp;#39;s pretend a speculative asset masquerading as the most deflationary currency ever is the future of finance. This is a Very Good Idea and I&amp;amp;#39;m actually an expert on economics, not a con artist trying to attract as many suckers as possible to pay me real money for my hoarded assets.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;I’m not convinced it is here to stay. What is the utility of bitcoin? At least gold is used in electronics, jewelry etc…&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Digital Beanie Babies.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;I put my entire net worth into beanie babies and He-Man action figures.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;I mean NFTs are basically the crypto equivalent of beanie babies with the difference being that with beanie babies you actually have something that is worth a damn whereas NFTs are a fucking worthless scam.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Jesus fuck what is wrong with that dude?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;El Salvadors President Jesus fuck what is wrong with that dude?&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;This year, I invested in pumpkins. They&amp;amp;#39;ve been going up the whole month of October and I got a feeling they&amp;amp;#39;re going to peak right around January. Then, bang! That&amp;amp;#39;s when I&amp;amp;#39;ll cash in.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;I’m sticking with my tulip bulbs.I’m sticking with my tulip bulbs.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Obligatory Beanie Babies vs Bitcoin Investment Guide&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;This happens to things whose only value is derived from what people are willing to pay for it. That bitcoin is worth anything is only because people think they will be able to sell it for more than they bought/manufactured it for. Maybe I&amp;amp;#39;m wrong, but I don&amp;amp;#39;t think bitcoin is substantially different than beanie babies. If people decide it&amp;amp;#39;s no longer valued, it&amp;amp;#39;s just virtual junk.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;COVID. All the predictions of OMICRON disaster were wildly overstated. Here in the UK, ALL restrictions will be permanently abolished from this Saturday. The same in several other European countries.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Ukraine. Despite the chest thumping, there will be no major conflagration in Ukraine. Russia cannot afford to lose face and will back down - whilst making a small, grandiose gesture.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Putin has confirmed that Russia will NOT be banning crypto. That was obvious, but it&amp;amp;#39;s still bullish news.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;BTC Futures are currently at 0.93 - the highest for some time. The markets have fully priced in the gradual phasing out of tapering and up to 4 x 0.25% rate increase this year.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Global supply chains are recovering faster than governments expected. Again, this is due to Covid becoming less menacing.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The US Labor Market is now officially &amp;amp;#39;Strong&amp;amp;#39;.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There will be serious profit taking in the next few hours, but that&amp;amp;#39;s to be expected. But we&amp;amp;#39;re now back on firm ground until the Spring.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
