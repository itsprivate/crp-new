I&amp;amp;#39;m getting pretty tired of our little market. There&amp;amp;#39;s so much that is just so rediculous.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For starters, wasn&amp;amp;#39;t the whole point to get away from the mainstream markets and banks? Now here we are, directly correlated to the moves of the stock market, driven by bots, Wall Street bankers and big finance whales.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And while we have such a tiny market cap, so much money is diverted into an entirely seperate market that recently blew up, NFT&amp;amp;#39;s. How much retail interest that otherwise would have gone into crypto&amp;amp;#39;s longer term was wasted on the NFT market by buying shitty JPG&amp;amp;#39;s of monkeys and rocks with laser eyes? What the hell were crypto people thinking promoting that BS other than trying to make a quick buck off the backs of ignorant retailers? If people had any forsight, that interest and limited funds would have been much better used in crypto projects. And that new retail would have been much better off for it too. Sure, many would have left with the market downturn, but many would have held too. But now all that new interest has been wasted by getting burned by a (so far) shitty use case in a side-market that&amp;amp;#39;s &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/nft-sales-plummet-92-market-133403653.html&quot;&amp;gt;down over 90%&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. A large percentage of whom never entered the crypto market itself.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And then there&amp;amp;#39;s all the news driven BS and shitty meme coins. Doge coin? Shiba inu? Are you f*cking kidding me? Meme BS like that does nothing but damage the markets credibility, and again ... divert limited funds away from legitimate projects.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And we&amp;amp;#39;re entirely dependent on people like Elon Musk (who I like, but that doesn&amp;amp;#39;t change the fact that the market depending on his involvement is rediclulous), that something-something-Miller guy, Saylor, Kwon, ... Since when do we care what a few rich folks do? As retail we have the power to move the market. Too many people are just wasting their money on shitty NFT&amp;amp;#39;s and futures trading, rather than buying spot.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s sad to see this market turn into such a joke and be entirely at the behest of Wall Street ...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hell I still remember back in 2018 everyone was bemoaning the fact that the entire market was tied to the price of Bitcoin. Now here we are, not only still tied to Bitcoin but to the stock market too. What a sad joke.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Grow up. Be the change you want to see. See people about to waste their money on NFT&amp;amp;#39;s? Slap them. Thinking about participating in the futures market? Stick with spot. Thinking about shorting? Don&amp;amp;#39;t, just buy the dips. See news about Elon, Saylor or Kwon? Don&amp;amp;#39;t give a f*. Just DCA, stake, build, whatever it takes. Invest only what you can afford to miss for the long run and ignore the short term noise. This is the only place a lot of us see as an alternative to the old world. A potential for escape from all the control and restrictions. The endless boomer politicians sticking their grubby paws into everything. And however small we are as individuals, as a whole, we &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;can&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; move markets and change things. In more ways than one. We need an alternative system and so far, this is the best one we&amp;amp;#39;ve got. Don&amp;amp;#39;t waste it or let the old world shake you out and undermine it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you&amp;amp;#39;ve made a bad decision, and have to accept a negative outcome it&amp;amp;#39;s worth aknowledging that to move on. Alot of people struggle with this.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;No more blaming outside parties, or us against them. Blocking out all criticism. Putting more and more faith into delusional utopian outcomes. Going into the whole &amp;amp;quot;well at least we aren&amp;amp;#39;t X project&amp;amp;quot; and so, so much more.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;No one likes being made a fool of, and no one likes to admit they were ignorant in their choices. Yet it is something that needs to be done to wake up to the reality of the situation and make the decisions that need to be done. Dwelling on a dead or dying project is only going to hold you back.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As stated numerous times on this subreddit. Everyone wants to be the $500 to $100k holder as that&amp;amp;#39;s what everyone hears about. No one wants to be the $1000 to $0.01 holder, yet a majority of us will be and we will need to accept that when it happens.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is your call to make as you are the person who holds yourself back or pushes yourself forward. Choose wisely.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Minting their “Otherdeeds” cost 305 APE and generated over $550 million in sales in the first day all on the hope that they’re going to do something interesting with virtual real estate. I don’t get why the vast majority of the hype is around virtual real estate NFTs when there are several projects already doing stuff with &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;real life&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; real estate via NFTs.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I learned about these Web3 real estate projects recently and they seem so much more tangible than most metaverse projects. It’s not like Web3 real estate projects are immune to issues. Balcony DAO, Propy, CitaDAO, etc. all have their issues and I’m not going to pretend like they don’t. DeFi is the future but there are a lot of kinks that will have to be worked out. But I continue to be surprised that so much hype and money goes towards virtual real estate on the expectation that &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;maybe someday&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; these virtual spaces will have enough users rather than going towards projects focused on real buildings that people really need to live in and can produce income from.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If anyone is curious, here’s some of the real estate NFT projects that seem most interesting (in alphabetical order):&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.balconydao.com/&quot;&amp;gt;Balcony DAO&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;: This is in the early stages but they’re one of the most interesting ones.  Their goal is to take major real estate investment opportunities (think residential skyscrapers) that are normally inaccessible to the average investor and turn them into investing opportunities for regular people via NFTs. They have a fully doxxed team with founders who are well known and respected in the real estate space.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://citadao.io/&quot;&amp;gt;CitaDAO&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;: They want real estate to be tokenized and transacted on chain. One of their focal points is steady rental income from their projects. They’re starting with property in England and their process involves staking USDC in a pool. Their initial fundraising effort failed to capture enough revenue, falling about 30% short of the total they needed, but still felt like a good proof of concept for the DAO. They still have future plans to pursue another IRO (Introducing Real Estate On-chain) round.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lofty.ai/&quot;&amp;gt;Lofty AI&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;: They’re a startup where you can buy shares in tokenized rental properties. Shares can go as low as $50 so the ceiling for involvement is very low. They’re similar to existing projects like Fundrise and Roofstock but they have a lower bar for entry.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://propy.com/&quot;&amp;gt;Propy&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;: Propy is maybe the most well known player in this space. Their focus is on normal real estate transactions in the Web3 world. Instead of buying or selling your house through normal means, you can trade it like an NFT. They claim to have sold the world’s first real estate NFT.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I loved the highs, but frankly I have only begun to dig my own grave by the amount of lows I&amp;amp;#39;ve been through. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bad decision making, thinking &amp;amp;quot;yeah this&amp;amp;#39;ll work out&amp;amp;quot; and being a fucking gambling addicted idiot.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I have sold the last but of my crypto, and I am genuinely done. I&amp;amp;#39;ve gone through to many sleepless nights of uncertainty, too many days of overthinking. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I am out. Goodbye fellas.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A) an addictive personality
B) have mental health issues

Just take a look at his tweets history and you will understand what I&amp;amp;#39;m saying - and he is just one of them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m annoyed of Dogecoin because of these people. How can your life be resumed by &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;convincing people all the time&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; that there&amp;amp;#39;s a crypto out there that is worth paying for?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“Investing in cryptocurrencies is a risky and speculative gamble, and we are concerned that Fidelity would take these risks with millions of Americans’ retirement savings,”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Claimed that Elon single handedly pumped BTC by 8% —&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“Bitcoin’s volatility is compounded by its susceptibility to the whims of just a handful of influencers. Elon Musk’s tweets alone have led to Bitcoin value fluctuations as high as 8%.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Call BTC dangerously centralized —&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;The high concentration of Bitcoin ownership and mining exacerbates these volatility risks. One study estimates that just 10% of Bitcoin miners are responsible for processing 90% of Bitcoin transactions and that 1,000 individuals control 3 million Bitcoins – about 15% of the current Bitcoin supply.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All this was written as &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/22/05/27030896/sen-elizabeth-warren-questions-fidelity-on-crypto-401-k-product-what-you-need-to-know&quot;&amp;gt;part of a letter&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; by Warren (and senator Tina Smith) to Fidelity&amp;amp;#39;s CEO. The senators gave Fidelity until May 18 to answer questions regarding risks related to cryptocurrency and whether this offering posed a conflict of interest.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

There’s the fact that some cryptos have a limited supply just like Bitcoin. Other coins are untraceable like Monero and are great for privacy and DeFi is decentralized and safe from government interference.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But out of all features that will later prove crypto more superior than fiat, I think that low transfer fees is what will bring in new people initially and make crypto go mainstream.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The reason I’m saying this is cause I’m seeing it in my own eyes. I live in a country where a lot of young people live abroad and help their families out with extra cash end of month.
Western Union here is HELLA EXPENSIVE so I’m seeing a lot of people who have never had any encounter with crypto before open a wallet and start using platforms like Binance and E-Money cause of the ultra low fees and fast transfers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I’m not saying other features in crypto aren’t important. In fact I think limited supply and decentralization are much more important features. I’m just saying that low fees is what will most likely attract the largest number of people.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Essentially, this has allowed them to tank the price for a week and continue to throw tiny breadcrumbs in the hope most users will forgive them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I am particularly fascinated by the introduction to re-stake before June 1 and keep all existing offers - because to be honest, I think most people were counting down the days until the they were free from their stake - and the peak of investors wads about to expire over the next three weeks. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The problem with that, is most people are down so they will have to invest more to re-stake at the ongoing rate. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Source from Twitter quoted below for reference. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;We&amp;amp;#39;ve been engaging with the community all week about card rewards, and we&amp;amp;#39;re making a few more updates based on your feedback&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The process has been far from ideal, but it&amp;amp;#39;s important to take your feedback into account, and deliver an attractive yet balanced offering.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;✅ Ruby Steel cashback is increasing from .5% to 1%&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;✅ Jade &amp;amp;amp; Indigo cashback is increasing from 1.5% to 2%&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;✅ Current card rewards will be locked-in for six months if you re-stake before June 1, 2022&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;✅ We will waive the card upgrade fee ($50) until further notice&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Once again, thank you to everyone who provided feedback 🙏&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I asked for an official notice that all Russian citizens should be blocked, without the possibility of withdrawal.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I am a simple person, not connected in any way and not supporting the war in Ukraine. I created an account in 2019, verified it, confirmed the legal origin of the funds.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And now the exchange just wants to appropriate my money, referring to what is happening in Ukraine.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Why is no other exchange taking measures like yours?? Two weeks later, your support team cannot give me an answer, but is just playing for time. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;TICKET #BIT-1438832&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

It is losing approximately a million dollars each week it currently has less than $7m. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If the liquidity pool is no longer able to support the swapping of tokens between Safemoon and Binance coin, it will have to be disabled. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyone who still holds Safemoon at that point will no longer be able to sell it. Effectively rendering it worth nothing. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Holding at this point is literally the most risky strategy for you poor old Safemoon victims.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I would say this is not financial advice, but being invested in Safemoon means you probably won’t listen anyway. Good luck to you all.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Because Bitcoin and other cryptos are supposed to be a hedge against the stock markets corrections. But bitcoin basically follows the stock market. And if a recession happens I want to be making money on crypto so that I doesn’t have to worry about a recession or inflation. I hope it will change in the future so that Bitcoin becomes a digital gold that can be used to hedge against stock market corrections and recessions. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Does anyone agree with me on this or am I delusional for thinking that crypto should have been the ultimate hedge against inflation and recessions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

He was sentenced to 40 years in prison, but got a reduction after handing over his Bitcoin stash. People often remind him they could be worth billions now, but he always thought his freedom was more important. “What’s the use of having a few hundred million euros if you’re in prison?” he said.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;BTC current price 39,800 x 380,000 = 15.1 billion &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Couple of questions here...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What does the US do with that BTC?
And would you sacrifice 30 years for 15 billion?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
