&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Background: how high are those Fed rates eventually gonna go and how big is the effect?&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s important to keep things in perspective.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Lowering or increasing rates, doesn&amp;amp;#39;t necessarily mean we&amp;amp;#39;ll have very high or very low rates.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In fact, Fed rates are only going up from a near 0 floor. We&amp;amp;#39;re not jumping from high rates to higher rates.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The long term plan by the Fed is to target around 2 -2.5%.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is far from being high rates. These are still low rates designed more to stimulate an economy. With cost of borrowing still not very expensive.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In fact, 2% is simply going back to 2020 rates and the pre-covid normal.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;The key points of the JPOW&amp;amp;#39;s meeting:&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;-0.5 fed hikes as expected, following the roadmap to 2%.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;-75 basis points moved off the table. This lowers a lot of uncertainty.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;-Unemployment at one of the lowest in 50 years.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;-Wages moving up.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;-According to JPOW, inflation has likely peaked, and expects it to go down.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;-The economy is &amp;amp;quot;not vulnerable to a recession&amp;amp;quot; and &amp;amp;quot;the economy is doing fairly well&amp;amp;quot; according to JPOW.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;-JPOW&amp;amp;#39;s tone has changed since the last meeting. From a somber dovish tone, to a more hawkish and optimistic tone.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;What does it mean for Bitcoin and ultimately crypto?&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The US has the biggest share of the Bitcoin market, so while this may seem very US-centric, what happens in the US could affect the crypto market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Probably not as much as most people would expect.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While the correlation between Bitcoin and US stocks has increased since Covid, it has only increased from nearly 0 and weak correlation, to only a moderate and inconsistent correlation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The correlation works more strongly, when the crypto market is already more vulnerable to move in that direction.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Right now, crypto has been testing lows, and may have been forming a bottom.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If stocks do well and go up, it could help boost crypto in going in the path of least resistance, which right now is up.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There is one important effect that should still affect the crypto market: liquidity.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Even if whales trading bots don&amp;amp;#39;t care about the cost of a car loan increasing, they do care about liquidity coming into the market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Additional data about the current state of the US economy:&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;US real GDP growth has decreased at a rate of about 1.4% this quarter.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Unemployment is down to 3.8%.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Consumer expenditure has increased 2.7% despite inflation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Residential investment has gone up 2%.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The trade gap has increased to $110 Billion.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Covid cases have been steadily rising this year to about 30K per day for the US. They are still much lower than last summer, and compared to the major part of 2021.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Conclusion:&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The policy remains the same: kicking the can down the road.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Don&amp;amp;#39;t bet the farm on a great depression just yet. It&amp;amp;#39;s possible, but... realize that it&amp;amp;#39;s not the only scenario at play. We are still at a tipping point where it could go either way.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We are still in a potential scenario where this was just a correction. Likely more due to the extra liquidity turned off, and liquidity getting more back to normal, and the market having to re-adjust to reality with no more extra money printed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So it&amp;amp;#39;s not completely out of the question that the stock market could eventually resume its run, as businesses re-open, supply chains unclog, economic growth picks up again, inflation stabilizes, and maybe even the war in Ukraine ends or becomes less uncertain.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If markets pick up again, that will be very good for bringing back liquidity into crypto, along with confidence. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For now, the more short term result of this meeting on crypto, the odds favoring going for the path of least resistance to test $40K again.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;2) APE jumped up 20%. The news was spreading fast.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;2) Musk tweets: &amp;amp;quot;I dunno... Seems pretty fungible to me.&amp;amp;quot;  Perpetuating the idea that NFTs are essentially jpegs that anyone can make an unlimited amount of copies of.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;4) APE drops all the way back and keeps going. From this point, as usual, it may go up or down.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If Elon gave the market several days before delivering his punchline, the results on APE FOMOers would have been catastrophic. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What lesson can we learn from this? I dunno... Someone learned not to invest based on Elon&amp;amp;#39;s tweets today for sure.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These advantages include lower fees, speed, scalability, decentralization and already being proof of stake. (It’s debatable whether proof of stake is superior or proof of work but I won’t go into that). &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Other than being the most adopted smart contract platform and being “first to market,” is Ethereum actually technically better than most other Layer 1s out there?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Don’t get me wrong I’m bullish on Ethereum, but I’m even more bullish on other Layer 1s.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I was downvoted / shouted down for the crime of suggesting Bitcoin is somehow &amp;amp;quot;political&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yea yea, BiTcOiN iS aPoLiTiCaL. Meanwhile, Congress is encouraging the EPA to essentially boot Bitcoin from the United States.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I have my coins in Cold Storage and I understand the tech. I&amp;amp;#39;m not concerned about confiscation or my ability to spend/transfer. I am concerned about effectively living in China while not living in China at all. People on this sub keep insinuating Bitcoin is alive and well in Communist China, despite the CCP&amp;amp;#39;s clampdown... But I haven&amp;amp;#39;t seen many reputable sources to confirm this, so you&amp;amp;#39;ll have to pardon my skepticism. The recent letter to the EPA makes it clear that the current Democratic Congress in the United States is flirting with a CCP style agenda with respect to Bitcoin. That scares the hell out of me, and it should scare the hell out of you.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s becoming clear that IF the United States and Europe decide to go the way of China with regards to banning Proof of Work mining, then we Americans can all thank our local Democratic congressman or congresswoman for doing their part in our &amp;amp;quot;progress&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;PLEASE. Get out there and vote these banking-industry sluts out of office so that US citizens don&amp;amp;#39;t have to live under the CCP by proxy.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On February 1st 2021, I sent 10,000 USD to Bitfinex to lend out to margin traders, but the funds have not shown up in my account since. I have been in constant contact with Bitfinex support and my personal bank. The former keep giving me opaque excuses as to why my funds have not been credited to my account. Before they ‘couldn’t locate my funds’, now they claim to be able to see the funds but their bank ‘isn’t replying’. They literally couldn’t care less about me and my funds. My bank have exhausted every option to attempt to recover my funds - they say that the receiving bank have been uncooperative. I have a letter from my personal bank confirming that the funds were successfully sent, and I have an ‘official’ letter from Adrian Capron at Deltec Bank &amp;amp;amp; Trust claiming that they have not received my funds (even though Bitfinex have since said they can see the funds).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is a warning to all - &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;stay away from Bitfinex, Tether, Deltec&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. It is also a call for help - does anyone have any suggestions as to how I can rectify this situation? Has this happened to anyone else recently? &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Any cross-community reposts would be greatly appreciated.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; I have seen similar cases where publicity has resulted in a resolution. I will not stop until I have my money back.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Since my funds vanished, I have looked into Bitfinex, Tether, and Deltec, it seems that Bitfinex have previously lost client funds, as their off-shore bank accounts were frozen by authorities for corporate fraud. Apparently Bitfinex kept client funds all in one commingled account. Then ensued cases of clients not being able to withdraw funds - Bitfinex&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/2021.02.17_-_settlement_agreement_-_execution_version.b-t_signed-c2_oag_signed.pdf&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;denied&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;this claim. I knew tether was not fully legit, but I wasn’t aware of really how fraudulent the organisations were.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

If you have been lurking on &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/cc&quot;&amp;gt;r/cc&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; for few months, you would notice how most of this sub loves Algorand. Less than $0.01 transaction fees, seconds of finality and TPS of over thousands, what is there not to like?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The price action. The price action in Algorand has been shit. Part of that has been due to the accelerated vesting that occured once Algo hit its price target last year. Another common complaint that investors have is that Algorand is not focusing on marketing. However, in the past few weeks, we have seen a change from this. First the stunt Algorand Foundation pulled on Earth day. Now Algorand Foundation has partnered with the FIFA organisation for the upcoming men and women worldcup. Hopefully they would continue to take correct steps like this and positive price action would be observed. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyway, bear markets are the best time to accumulate and Algorand is one of the best, if not the best layer 1 solution. They have got lot of things which others are only promising to deliver and this seems like a good time to scoop up some. Not financial advise though and this could all be very risk as Bitcoin could continue to be in a free fall and keep on sucking all Alts dry. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Algorand on Earth day: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/algorand/how-the-algorand-ecosystem-celebrated-earth-day-2022-b7923288aa9d&quot;&amp;gt;https://medium.com/algorand/how-the-algorand-ecosystem-celebrated-earth-day-2022-b7923288aa9d&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

That&amp;amp;#39;s why now more than ever its crusial to stick to your strategy, make rational decisions and NOT fall for mind tricks and fallacies. And it&amp;amp;#39;s certainly not the time to abandon simple math!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We&amp;amp;#39;ve all heard of sunk cost fallacy, gambler&amp;amp;#39;s fallacy, survivorship bias, confirmation bias and the like.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now after seeing a bunch of bullshit twitter posts, 
I wanted to bring this one to your attention.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;DOT is 70% down from its ATH. Buy now it&amp;amp;#39;s the best risk/reward ratio you&amp;amp;#39;ll get — can go only 30% down.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I don&amp;amp;#39;t have a problem with the DOT-buying part, I have a problem with this reasoning.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;1) No cryptocurrency is guaranteed to return to its all time high. It happened before. It may or may not happen in the future.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;2) There is always equal upside and downside potential. Always. From the moment you invest (even if the asset was one valued 3 times or 50 times more), the dollar value of your investment can go 30%, 70% or 90% up or down. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;So whenever you invest, it is still possible your $100 will turn into $50 or $10.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;3) Twitter and other social media is NOT where you seek financial advice.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyway, I hope you&amp;amp;#39;re doing fine. Buy, sell, do whatever you choose. Just make sure the decisions you make aren&amp;amp;#39;t based on false logic.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is the general summary of the changes:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Instead of eliminating card staking earn rates completely, we will offer a more balanced approach:  8% APY for Private Members (Obsidian, Icy White, and Frosted Rose Gold)  4% APY for Royal Indigo and Jade Green card holders &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now while these are much more appealing than the initial rate changes, my question to those who have already switched platforms or who are considering doing so, is this enough for you to go back to CDC? I feel like they lost the trust of many of their users by springing the extreme changes on them with no prior notice just a few days ago, and I&amp;amp;#39;m not sure this will be enough to avoid a mass exodus away from CDC.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Especially there is a lot of mass adoption coming from banks. As many mlhave added Bitcoin ans other cryptos to their balance sheet and as an option for traders to invest in. Also we have just seen the first Bitcoin backed loans from Goldman Sachs.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s clear that a lot of mass adoption is happening right now especially from sides that would typically not be that friendly towards crypto.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But you know what I like more than Hopium? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Knowledge!&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I after reading some comments on this sub I feel like a lot of people could avoid losing money if they simply understood Market cap.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Definition&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, market capitalization (or market cap) is the total value of all the coins that have been mined. It’s calculated by multiplying the number of coins in circulation by the current market price of a single coin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Example&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;If Cryptocurrency A has 400,000 coins in circulation and each coin is worth $1, it’s market cap is $400,000. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;If Cryptocurrency B has 100,000 coins in circulation and each coin is worth $2, it’s market cap is $200,000.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Even though the individual coin price of Cryptocurrency B is higher than Cryptocurrency A, Cryptocurrency A’s overall value is double Cryptocurrency B’s. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Understand that most shillers don&amp;amp;#39;t understand Market cap or are lying to you, look at the example below to see the predictions so called crypto experts are pushing on youtube. (I searched for CRO and took a couple of screen shots)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/5zusgth8n2x81.jpg?width=1284&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=2190bf7f323f3c77ff25cb29154fd7a817961888&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/5zusgth8n2x81.jpg?width=1284&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=2190bf7f323f3c77ff25cb29154fd7a817961888&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can see they are predicting the price of CRO to go anywhere from $10 to $300, is this possible?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;No, its not&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;you can use this website to compare market cap of different coins to get an idea of what a realistic price point is. (&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketcapof.com/&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.marketcapof.com/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/tub8q72co2x81.png?width=888&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=14e2b995e3b5a6377f53fb4bda84f34b7709d799&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/tub8q72co2x81.png?width=888&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=14e2b995e3b5a6377f53fb4bda84f34b7709d799&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/6j0sy92co2x81.png?width=920&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=57dfab5cbdbd61cde6007b0078fad9a7cd9a3e3f&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/6j0sy92co2x81.png?width=920&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=57dfab5cbdbd61cde6007b0078fad9a7cd9a3e3f&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/brffxb2co2x81.png?width=792&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=3c0ed5c4e95ef1de363a2ad3b5d03e139594a411&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/brffxb2co2x81.png?width=792&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=3c0ed5c4e95ef1de363a2ad3b5d03e139594a411&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So even at the market cap of bitcoin CRO would only hit $29.28&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;so no CRO will not hit $300 a coin just because BNB is around $380 and they are both exchanges.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The faster you learn what is realistic the better off you will be.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also avoid crypto youtube, they prey on the gullible and will only cause you to lose more money.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There he called Bitcoin &amp;amp;quot;stupid because it’s very likely to go to zero&amp;amp;quot; and also praised Chinese leader Xi Jinping for banning BTC.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He also claimed that Bitcoin is &amp;amp;quot;evil&amp;amp;quot;. Yet his company Berkshire Hathaway invested $28 billion in Chevron and Occidental Petroleum in just the first 3 months of 2022. The same Chevron that is responsible for one of the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://europeangreens.eu/brussels2013/content/chevron-texaco-and-environmental-disaster-amazon&quot;&amp;gt;worst ecological disasters in history &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;when it dumped over 18.5 billion gallons of toxic water into the Amazon rainforest contaminating two million acres of the Ecuadorian Amazon.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And why did he call BTC evil? For its environmental effects? &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxbusiness.com/business-leaders/charlie-munger-bitcoin-stupid-evil-bad&quot;&amp;gt;Nope&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;it’s evil because it undermines the Federal Reserve System and national currency system, which we desperately need to maintain its integrity and government control and so on&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is the mindset of these people. Evil doesnt mean destroying the world. Evil is anything that tries to disrupt the status quo. God forbid anyone else becomes rich!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
