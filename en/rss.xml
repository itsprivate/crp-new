&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Financially supporting the Ukrainian army or people who are suffering is a fantastic and noble thing to do. It’s the right thing do and the least most of us can do.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I wish I could buy the bullets that personally kill the Russian invaders. But it’s not that simple.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As we all know scammers have a vacuum for a heart and are trying to profit off of this crisis. “Ukrainian relief funds” are more than likely scammers accepting your thoughtful donations. Worse yet even Russians creating fake donations to soak up the funds for their cause.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The ONLY way I would donate is by sending it directly to someone you know of in Ukraine who needs it or can distribute it. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Do NOT let your guard down. Scammers will profit off of anything even this. Yes it is a new low.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If anything, this will give you the ability to change strategies. I actually sold around 55k and slowly started seeing that Bitcoin isnt the right investment for me.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I started staking and went heavy on DeFi projects like AAVE since they’re the best at lending (which gave me a lot of leverage)and new ones like BitDAO which have the largest treasury in the market so the governance power behind it was strong.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TAKING PROFITS IS NOT SHAMEFUL.
I don’t know why this sub treats it as a sin. Its actually smart to sell if you make an educated decision as to when.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit edit:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There are some weird people on here. ‘Funding someone’s war’, ‘Russia uses bitcoin - bitcoin is bad’. There always has to be those few people who try to be too clever. Innocent civilians are dying because they’ve been invaded by a dictator, hellbent on making history, and all you care about is trying to win internet points by being edgy and against the grain. Get a grip. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Just a small minority though, and thankfully most of this sub is full of kind people. Peace and love ❤️&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;His post:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is a follow-up to &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/szv6oc/evidence_that_charlesiohk_was_involved_in/&quot;&amp;gt;https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/szv6oc/evidence_that_charlesiohk_was_involved_in/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In that post, I gave a list of about 150 addresses that connected IOHK&amp;amp;#39;s wallet to the billion ADA unstaked wallet involved in the SundaeSwap front-running. Naturally, I was accused of FUD, saying that I made it up and that there was no way someone could track that accurately.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here&amp;amp;#39;s a much shorter path connecting the two wallets.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;📷&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Starting from IOHK&amp;amp;#39;s address &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://cardanoscan.io/transactions?address=DdzFFzCqrhsytyf2oUxqFNXDX9MfAFBWk9pTBXViZbSwxEi7PYcq9LSjBDcW6BVcA7KxgeixYWospQKn68P9PaviM2FvhTFvsEezT8qg&quot;&amp;gt;https://cardanoscan.io/transactions?address=DdzFFzCqrhsytyf2oUxqFNXDX9MfAFBWk9pTBXViZbSwxEi7PYcq9LSjBDcW6BVcA7KxgeixYWospQKn68P9PaviM2FvhTFvsEezT8qg&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, it takes less than 15 steps to go from that wallet to the billion ADA unstaked wallet associated with the SundaeSwap front-running.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can see in the left column the outgoing address along the path, and in the right column, you see the amount of one of the transactions from the prior address to that address. The right column only gives one transaction amount even when there may be others, since it&amp;amp;#39;s only looking at the first page of transactions when going to the transactions page. If there were dozens of transactions outgoing to that address, then the right column only is reporting one of them listed on the first page of transactions. You can see that all but one transaction is on the order of hundreds of millions or billions of ADA. This is not IOHK paying an employee (unless employees are being paid hundreds of millions of ADA!).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To follow along with how to read the table, first go to IOHK&amp;amp;#39;s original wallet &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://cardanoscan.io/transactions?address=DdzFFzCqrhsytyf2oUxqFNXDX9MfAFBWk9pTBXViZbSwxEi7PYcq9LSjBDcW6BVcA7KxgeixYWospQKn68P9PaviM2FvhTFvsEezT8qg&quot;&amp;gt;https://cardanoscan.io/transactions?address=DdzFFzCqrhsytyf2oUxqFNXDX9MfAFBWk9pTBXViZbSwxEi7PYcq9LSjBDcW6BVcA7KxgeixYWospQKn68P9PaviM2FvhTFvsEezT8qg&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. Then find the first outgoing address in the table above and click that link to go to the transactions for that address.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So click on: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://cardanoscan.io/address/DdzFFzCqrht3wEZNURs9U5Qp7HnLoi9Cpao2YzThm88CqvLuP9uTmGzpwQc2e9VSUNGPhR7pAz3g9TtnBx3YoiiJ712Va3dBZNTXkTYT&quot;&amp;gt;https://cardanoscan.io/address/DdzFFzCqrht3wEZNURs9U5Qp7HnLoi9Cpao2YzThm88CqvLuP9uTmGzpwQc2e9VSUNGPhR7pAz3g9TtnBx3YoiiJ712Va3dBZNTXkTYT&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then go to the next outgoing address in the table: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://cardanoscan.io/address/DdzFFzCqrhsrbtzv9G1qXfGq5mKVeF6AWg2TcuS3qjfLyhHgVATsP3PeocKqkraN6VwbZrNvN2iHeCd8iESanCP8FQS6BnyaThGjLNEc&quot;&amp;gt;https://cardanoscan.io/address/DdzFFzCqrhsrbtzv9G1qXfGq5mKVeF6AWg2TcuS3qjfLyhHgVATsP3PeocKqkraN6VwbZrNvN2iHeCd8iESanCP8FQS6BnyaThGjLNEc&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then go to the next outgoing address in the table: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://cardanoscan.io/address/DdzFFzCqrhsnRxkcmJ1ukkN26iefboWFwKLx95G2bW92mutMGqibYJNYuNgbGppCC32tfqWMa8XpWev9jVXoNUQEQPmcDeRh28UJBXvC&quot;&amp;gt;https://cardanoscan.io/address/DdzFFzCqrhsnRxkcmJ1ukkN26iefboWFwKLx95G2bW92mutMGqibYJNYuNgbGppCC32tfqWMa8XpWev9jVXoNUQEQPmcDeRh28UJBXvC&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You don&amp;amp;#39;t need to question whether I made up these transactions or manipulated the Cardano blockchain in some way. These records are immutable and they are available for you to verify, so go verify. I will probably be accused of being a paranoid schizophrenic again, and maybe I am, but who cares! The point of blockchain is that you don&amp;amp;#39;t need to trust me or anyone else. I know some of you reading this will instinctively be defensive and lash out with insults, but I dare you to verify the transactions yourself before downvoting.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Edit:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Thanks for taking up the challenge and looking into this. Some of you found that there was only a 10 ADA transaction between two of the addresses. That&amp;amp;#39;s because both output addresses (one with 10 ADA and the other with 241 million ADA) are tied to the same wallet. It&amp;amp;#39;s not obvious, but you can read more here &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/t0q8kn/comment/hyc8719/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;amp;context=3&quot;&amp;gt;https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/t0q8kn/comment/hyc8719/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;amp;context=3&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The TLDR form of that comment is: the wallet address ending in bs1Wq and wallet address ending in oQU1E are part of the same wallet. You can tell this since they are both outputs of TxHash 547f47b146464476c2da4184fa9123d147053b2e5c84d1f0ede1479a12afbd97, and then one is the input (oQU1E) while the other (bs1Wq) is the output of the next transaction of the bs1Wq address, with TxHash d632d8f487f156c2c91a46e15b066a22888aa2f71ed61bd2d33dd61f46b9590c. That indicates that these two addresses are linked and that the second transaction is a reshuffling of ADA between addresses of the same wallet.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Even if you aren&amp;amp;#39;t convinced that they are part of the same wallet, then suppose they&amp;amp;#39;re separate, independent addresses. Then that only adds one more address on the path connecting IOHK&amp;amp;#39;s wallet to the billion ADA unstaked wallet:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The volume from Tf4YT to oQU1E would be 241M. The volume from oQU1E to bs1Wq would be 25M.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How in the h-e-double hockey sticks does everyone figure out how farm/lend/stake/auto compound all these different protocols? I’ve spent the last few months watching videos, joining social media servers, reading articles and exploring platforms. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I feel more lost than ever. I just get to the point where I think I’ve figured out a way to earn a reasonable yield only to find out that it’s outdated and there are half a dozen new and improved ways to do what I’m looking for. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I’ve never been on a wilder goose chase. I can’t tell if I’m a technological idiot or if it really is this time consuming and difficult?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;EDIT: I’m not talking about staking PoS coins like ADA, DOT, etc. What I meant was coins/tokens that require additional steps such as BTC, LINK, etc. And yes, I could stake those on Celsius or BlockFi but I was referring more to LPs. But you are all correct, I am probably taking more time than the average person to figure this out. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It would appear I am a slight to moderate technological idiot&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sacramento Kings player De&amp;amp;#39;Aaron Fox announced his &amp;amp;quot;SwipaTheFox&amp;amp;quot; NFT project in mid-December, and the &amp;amp;quot;high utility NFT collection&amp;amp;quot; went live on January 15. The project roadmap promised a metaverse basketball court, a scholarship to a University of Kentucky student, and chances to win all-star gaming tickets, as well as &amp;amp;quot;much more to come&amp;amp;quot;. The project had over 100,000 people in its Discord, and pulled in about 475 ETH (about $1.5 million at the time).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Suddenly, on February 23, the project deleted its social media accounts and most of its Discord. Fox wrote in the remaining Discord announcements channel that &amp;amp;quot;The time and attention that y’all deserve and that I wanted to give you all/what this project requires, was not known to me and I overstepped and stretched myself too thin, trying to do this project in the middle of an NBA season.&amp;amp;quot; He promised to send anyone who bought more than five NFTs (which would have cost ~0.4 ETH, around $1,300, if bought at mint price) a signed jersey (thanks I guess!). Meanwhile, Fox made no apparent effort to communicate publicly that the project was shutting down, such as on his personal 288,000-follower Twitter account where he had previously been hyping the project.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;His response:  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I want to address an NFT project we launched recently. The project launch was ill timed. I delegated certain aspects to the launch of the NFT in an attempt to partner with professionals. We weren’t happy with the execution &amp;amp;amp; demand on my time and attention during the NBA season.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This project is about a brand that will continue to grow, but I have obligations that I must fulfill to the Sacramento Kings and their loyal fan base. They deserve all of my attention.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As I stated previously, I look forward to doing this again the right way and adding value to my NFT holders. I’m excited to learn from the entire NFT community as well. The project will be updated at the conclusion of the NBA season.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Link to his stats and salary:&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/f/foxde01.html&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/f/foxde01.html&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He averages 1.34 steals per game.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Many investors felt the project was safe because of De’Aaron Fox’s status. They felt it was unlikely someone with a $163M NBA contract would walk away from the NFT project with a few million.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;NFT holder on De&amp;amp;#39;Aaron Fox:   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;I would just like him to know that he’s a crook, true and true,&amp;amp;quot; Loaded Lion said. &amp;amp;quot;I&amp;amp;#39;ve never seen someone act so despicably. To lie about giving away scholarships, diverting all funds, taking funds away from people who are way poorer than him. It’s really low.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;FTX is no different and the free PR they&amp;amp;#39;ve been receiving for this apparently magnanimous gesture is unjustified. FTX have a minimum withdrawal limit of $100 and they have (so far) not announced that this will be revised or removed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So any Ukrainian that would like to access that &amp;amp;#39;free&amp;amp;#39; $25 will first need to send $75+ to FTX (almost 50% of a typical Ukrainian monthly salary).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is cynical PR fluff by FTX and should not be applauded - if and until they confirm that Ukrainians will NOT be subject to any minimum withdrawal limit.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Same things were said about the convoy protest in Canada. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I know most users joined crypto just to make some money, but Bitcoin was created for something greater than make you wish a lambo.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitcoin was created in order to give freedom to the whole world.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Most of you are Americans and you think your government should control Bitcoin, but btc is not American, it&amp;amp;#39;s not yours. Bitcoin is for everyone. Bitcoin is for the people all around the world.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If the US wants to really sanction Russia, they have better and easier ways. Just look at what they did to the Chinese Huawei. It was the 3rd biggest smartphone seller in Europe and now it basically disappeared after it got sanctioned.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Do you think the west should kick Russia out from swift? Great idea. Do you know who will suffer more about it? Regular people in Russia who maybe are saving money because they hate their government and they want to leave their country, but now they won&amp;amp;#39;t be able because they can&amp;amp;#39;t transfer their money from their Russian bank account to another country.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitcoin fixes this.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Governments can fight, can give each other sanctions, can do a lot of things, but they shouldn&amp;amp;#39;t be able to touch people&amp;amp;#39;s money, and that&amp;amp;#39;s why Bitcoin was created.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He appears on Russian propaganda mouthpiece RT and spews anti-western views whilst calling Vladimir Putin &amp;amp;quot;A great statesman&amp;amp;quot; and &amp;amp;quot;The only adult in the room&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In that post, I gave a list of about 150 addresses that connected IOHK&amp;amp;#39;s wallet to the billion ADA unstaked wallet involved in the SundaeSwap front-running. Naturally, I was accused of FUD, saying that I made it up and that there was no way someone could track that accurately.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here&amp;amp;#39;s a much shorter path connecting the two wallets.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/i3t2q4djqvj81.png?width=1122&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=7bd324fafb9156a516417439ede1c7e15dd9576f&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/i3t2q4djqvj81.png?width=1122&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=7bd324fafb9156a516417439ede1c7e15dd9576f&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Starting from IOHK&amp;amp;#39;s address &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://cardanoscan.io/transactions?address=DdzFFzCqrhsytyf2oUxqFNXDX9MfAFBWk9pTBXViZbSwxEi7PYcq9LSjBDcW6BVcA7KxgeixYWospQKn68P9PaviM2FvhTFvsEezT8qg&quot;&amp;gt;https://cardanoscan.io/transactions?address=DdzFFzCqrhsytyf2oUxqFNXDX9MfAFBWk9pTBXViZbSwxEi7PYcq9LSjBDcW6BVcA7KxgeixYWospQKn68P9PaviM2FvhTFvsEezT8qg&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, it takes less than 15 steps to go from that wallet to the billion ADA unstaked wallet associated with the SundaeSwap front-running.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can see in the left column the outgoing address along the path, and in the right column, you see the amount of one of the transactions from the prior address to that address. The right column only gives one transaction amount even when there may be others, since it&amp;amp;#39;s only looking at the first page of transactions when going to the transactions page. If there were dozens of transactions outgoing to that address, then the right column only is reporting one of them listed on the first page of transactions. You can see that all but one transaction is on the order of hundreds of millions or billions of ADA. This is not IOHK paying an employee (unless employees are being paid hundreds of millions of ADA!).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To follow along with how to read the table, first go to IOHK&amp;amp;#39;s original wallet &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://cardanoscan.io/transactions?address=DdzFFzCqrhsytyf2oUxqFNXDX9MfAFBWk9pTBXViZbSwxEi7PYcq9LSjBDcW6BVcA7KxgeixYWospQKn68P9PaviM2FvhTFvsEezT8qg&quot;&amp;gt;https://cardanoscan.io/transactions?address=DdzFFzCqrhsytyf2oUxqFNXDX9MfAFBWk9pTBXViZbSwxEi7PYcq9LSjBDcW6BVcA7KxgeixYWospQKn68P9PaviM2FvhTFvsEezT8qg&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. Then find the first outgoing address in the table above and click that link to go to the transactions for that address.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You don&amp;amp;#39;t need to question whether I made up these transactions or manipulated the Cardano blockchain in some way. These records are immutable and they are available for you to verify, so go verify. I will probably be accused of being a paranoid schizophrenic again, and maybe I am, but who cares! The point of blockchain is that you don&amp;amp;#39;t need to trust me or anyone else. I know some of you reading this will instinctively be defensive and lash out with insults, but I dare you to verify the transactions yourself before downvoting.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Edit:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; What may blow your mind more is what happens when you either Google &amp;amp;quot;Ae2tdPwUPEZ6xYrxCgRDM2NQFM5oajHEoJN3i9ZVV2AbsbvxoJBjVu3yP7W&amp;amp;quot; and go to the cardano.org forum link or Google &amp;amp;quot;Ae2tdPwUPEZ6xYrxCgRDM2NQFM5oajHEoJN3i9ZVV2AbsbvxoJBjVu3yP7W twitter&amp;amp;quot; and click the Twitter link with a tweet of that address.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The world is again faced with war, which could signal the next and  possibly final war. This may be the biggest war since WW2, bigger than  any of us, and goes beyond politics or nationality. This is a war at a  time of peace when we are busy dealing with and recovering from the  COVID-19 crisis. People are dying, and the world is guessing whether the  West will join in or watch Ukraine fall to Putin&amp;amp;#39;s ambitions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We  generally do not get involved in politics despite our personal views as  a company. However, this is greater than politics, greater than anyone.  This is a war that may end the world. It certainly is ending the lives  of many innocent people in Eastern Europe. While there is little we can  do, it would be wrong to profit off of it or fund it indirectly. We are  canceling service to all Russian IPs and paying out outstanding  balances.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We apologize to our  Russian miners; many of you do not support the war. However, it is you  who are supporting your nation. Without the people, Russia cannot  operate. It is only through reducing the economic power of its people  that we have a chance of affecting this war. We thank you for your  loyalty, and I hope you understand that we do not make this decision  lightly. Should this situation be resolved peacefully, we will happily  welcome back all Russian miners and use our personal funds to make it up  to you.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you are in Ukraine and  reading this now, know that the world is with you.  We can&amp;amp;#39;t change the  situation ourselves. We call on other companies and people around the  world to join us and make a difference together. This isn&amp;amp;#39;t about  politics; this is about preventing the end of the world and saving  lives. Companies and people need to put the planet over profits in the  modern era. Ukraine has four nuclear power plants. Even ignoring the  chance of WW3, there is a chance of another Chernobyl should one of the  plants be endangered. The Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan happened  despite the plant having been forewarned so that they were shut down and  built to withstand an earthquake. Everyone in Europe, Russia, and the  Middle East are in danger of nuclear fallout should the worst happen.  Notice that the world will only end not because people do something but  because people know yet choose to do nothing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;China&amp;amp;#39;s Supreme Court ruled Thursday that virtual asset transactions constitute &amp;amp;quot;illegal fundraising,&amp;amp;quot; paving the way for judicial prosecution of the crypto industry.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While the People&amp;amp;#39;s Bank of China and a host of other top-level agencies had declared that crypto transactions are illegal fundraising back in September 2021, the court ruling formally designates them as a crime and determines related punishments.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thursday&amp;amp;#39;s ruling said that suspects will be prosecuted under Article 176 of China&amp;amp;#39;s criminal law, which stipulates prison sentences between three and 10 years and fines between RMB 50,000 (US$7,900) and RMB 500,000 ($79,000) for crimes involving large sums of money. Less serious crimes will be prosecuted with under three years of prison and RMB 20,000 ($3,160) to RMB 200,000 ($31,600) in fines, according to the criminal law.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The amendment comes into effect on March 1.
Chinese provincial authorities continue to crack down on the industry. The eastern province of Zhejiang announced increased electricity tariffs on Wednesday for crypto mining, joining Hainan and Inner Mongolia.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Crypto was supposed to be the safe haven during a time of crises. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/21m3bmz31uj81.jpg?width=736&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=872d806b02f8e4dd6575699961877e3ef41509cb&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/21m3bmz31uj81.jpg?width=736&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=872d806b02f8e4dd6575699961877e3ef41509cb&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s official, Bitcoin is not a good hedge asset. Even when the pandemic first started in March 2020, crypto crashed, exactly like the stock market. If you set aside your bias towards crypto and be smart, you&amp;amp;#39;d buy some PAXG right now. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But the problem is, when did Bitcoin become so coupled with the market?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

ETH falls 10% as a result of a larger market decline. This post on CryptoPotato caught my attention because I&amp;amp;#39;ve been investing in ETH for a few years.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The article said: &amp;amp;quot;ETH broke the support at $2,500. This opens the way for a potential drop towards $2,200, which is the first serious level to halt any further declines. The previous support at $2,500 has turned into resistance, and the market outlook is grim. The US stock market is due to open later today and may pull ETH lower still.&amp;amp;quot;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We&amp;amp;#39;re all already dealing with high gas prices and delayed transactions, and we&amp;amp;#39;re all looking for answers through various platforms, whether it&amp;amp;#39;s Loopring, Metis, or something else, and now we&amp;amp;#39;re facing such a drop that it&amp;amp;#39;s truly a bad scenario. Do you have any concerns about it?  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Another news is that Russian-born Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin blasts Putin for Ukraine invasion as crypto nosedive said: &amp;amp;quot;Ethereum is neutral, but I am not.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
I believe that ETH is neutral but it is inevitable that this whole situation will affect its current value, as it has an impact on the entire crypto market. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
