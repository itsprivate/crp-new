&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Everybody saying that now is the time to buy are just a bunch of bag holders who want you to invest so they can sell as soon as breaking even. Even genius investor Warren Buffett has stated that he wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t buy bitcoin for $25 dollars, who are we to disagree with 150 years of experience in the crypto space?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/e4hrhnjzxqw81.jpg?width=1284&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=05dacabdee2543b6080b3b0c9955db5236ddf551&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/e4hrhnjzxqw81.jpg?width=1284&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=05dacabdee2543b6080b3b0c9955db5236ddf551&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;as you can see above the crypto Fear and Greed index has hit a new low of (-20) Fire sale&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;what does this mean?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I heard reports that crypto investors are jumping out of their cabanas out in the Caribbean, sure they are landing in the ocean but that besides the point. It really does appear that after a decade Bitcoin has finally died.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;this was a great journey friends but we should probably sell any remaining crypto we have and put that money into a savings account with a high interest rate of 0.001%, we should be able to retire with it after another 50 years.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;good luck to you all!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Let me run down why for you:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;GPU prices are going back closer to MSRP&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;New gens of GPU and CPU are released later this year&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;mainstream medias supression of the announcement has suppressed LRC price, but that is bullish for us&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I personally know of a few friends who gave up gaming and sold their rigs when they changed jobs/ had children.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I spoke to some of them the other day about Loopring X GME and they told me they were considering building a new rig so they could experience what the GameStop NFT marketplace had to offer!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They were excited about the following:
- unique skins for weapons for your account
- unique content/ DLC which only you own
- certifiable ownership of your games on the blockchain (suck it, steam!!)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So really, this downturn coupled with MSMs suppression of GameStops announcement is probably going to work against them in the long run.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As our messiah Byron wrote on discord “sometimes you have to pick the highest mountain to find the most precious flower” and wow - LRC is that flower, and we are almost at the top!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Lööp up, brothers!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: wow, paid FUDders already downvoting! Bullish!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit 2: thanks for the suicide bot report, kind stranger!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

After 5 red weeks back in 2018 there was 1 green week and another 2 red weeks. The second of them found the bottom - 3156$ wich was lowest price for that cycle.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If history is going to repeat, it all can means, that bottom is really near and we will see rebound soon.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But this only one way of look.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The 2nd one is, we know shit about fuck and this thought doesn&amp;amp;#39;t mean anything at all.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://bscscan.com/tx/0x5b2f84b56d66f807cf5aa8f05ba8848875dba3a19f7a4c33717bae6182e90874&quot;&amp;gt;Transaction 1&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;hr/&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIUrE7Ovm5k&quot;&amp;gt;Coffeezilla&amp;amp;#39;s latest video&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;hr/&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This one is much quicker, snappier, and devastating.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The gist of it is that the Safemoon community has spent the last week and a half fervently denying that the wallets Coffee speculated were CEO John Karony&amp;amp;#39;s was a personal wallet, and therefore the movements in and out of the liquidity pools and receiving large payments from Bitmart etc were all kosher.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Someone tipped Coffee off to &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;yet another&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; pump-and-dump scheme organised by Ben Phillips, where Karony spent $300,000 on shitcoins. Ben Phillips also was part of some Hotdog NFT bullshit, and Karony mentioned he liked one publicly on twitter... that very safe NFT is owned by a wallet that Coffee uncovers.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;hr/&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The video does a much better job of explaining it than I do, but we&amp;amp;#39;re in the Endgame now fellas.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My RES tags on Reddit have been pulling overtime with all the people I&amp;amp;#39;ve tagged as &amp;amp;quot;Safemoon Cultist&amp;amp;quot;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What do they have to say? Let&amp;amp;#39;s find out.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Whale sold. Watch this dip get eaten.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Awwww. Just because you lost YOUR life savings and are butter hurt, doesn&amp;amp;#39;t mean everyone else is. Don&amp;amp;#39;t be mad... once FOMO hits, you&amp;amp;#39;ll be back.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Please stop buying bro karoney is stealing 100 trillion money i saw on ioutube truste me please stop ✋ 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We have less whales than most crypto tokens. Just check babscan!  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Well, if you would have paid attention you would know that when the youtuber posted his first video the price went down 25%... this time he posted and the price stayed pretty much the same. That&amp;amp;#39;s all  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;(That one aged like milk on a hot Texas day)  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“Why isn’t my fud working? Why aren’t they selling? Time to make up more shit!”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If it is a rug pull, would it be logical to spent 1 mln on a bill board, hire top qualified personnel, launch wallet, work on exchange, blockchain, card, websites, cross chain, etc. Would you start a LLC with liability, would you doxx, etc.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I haven’t watched any of his videos. Don’t need to  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Stopped reading at copy and paste wallet, that&amp;amp;#39;s a marching order term right there&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m fairly confident that this will be remembered as Safemoon&amp;amp;#39;s low point.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I believe this is all fud to make the price drop on purpose 😉&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So we have a mixed bag really. Most of the people who haven&amp;amp;#39;t already sold are just sticking their heads in the sand but the mounting volume of proof is starting to resonate with more and more people.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There&amp;amp;#39;s still quite a sizeable portion of people that think a turnaround is about to happen... So I guess let&amp;amp;#39;s sit back, crack open the popcorn and keep watching this incredible shit-show.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As part of Tethers settlement with the NY Attorney General they are required to publish quarterly reserve reports.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Extract from the settlement:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Publication of Tether’s Reserves: On at least a quarterly basis for a period of two (2) years following the effective date of this Settlement Agreement, Tether will publish the categories of assets backing tether (e.g., cash, loans, 
securities, etc.), specifying the percentages of each such category, and specifying whether any such category constituting a loan or receivable or similar is to an affiliated entity, in a form substantially similar to that previously presented to the OAG.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;The effective date of this Settlement Agreement shall be February 18, 2021.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2021/attorney-general-james-ends-virtual-currency-trading-platform-bitfinexs-illegal&quot;&amp;gt;https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2021/attorney-general-james-ends-virtual-currency-trading-platform-bitfinexs-illegal&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Attestation Reports&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They haven&amp;amp;#39;t published the March 2022 report. You can check yourself via the Tether site.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://tether.to/en/transparency/#reports&quot;&amp;gt;https://tether.to/en/transparency/#reports&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They were going steady throughout 2021&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Court Battle&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Is it something to do with the ongoing freedom on information request for information on Tethers reserves?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Coindesk has joined a suit between NYAG and Tether to allow NYAG to release documents regarding Tethers reserves to news media outlets.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/129602/coindesk-formally-joins-tether-freedom-of-information-case-in-new-york-tether-responds&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/129602/coindesk-formally-joins-tether-freedom-of-information-case-in-new-york-tether-responds&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Pretty suspect given the attestation report really doesn&amp;amp;#39;t impact the case, but if say coindesk does get the info and it conflicts against the attestation report then that wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t be good for business.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One thing is for sure, Tether has proven itself as the crypto market boat rocker.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

It is now at 40c which is more than 90% from its ATH and its less than a year old.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This project has been one disaster after another. Constant delays, regular fails to deliver, blaming others for the causes, ignoring questions from investors, VCs dumping hard, the list goes on. Check the post above for the full details.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;This post is more about echo-chambers.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That is the mantra. When something doesn&amp;amp;#39;t feel right, challenge it. If you get downvoted, suspended, banned whatever that is a massive red flag. As long as you are challenging respectfully and providing evidence for your concern, moderators have no right to remove you from the conversation. This is literally you doing your research.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you are prevented from doing your own research because the powers that be from the sub, discord, telegram, etc just keep pushing you out then you take the hint and get the f### out.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some of the worst examples here include Loopring and Safemoon (also down similar levels from ATH). Jump into their subs, their discord channels and their telegrams. Try challenging respectfully and see how long you last. If you think we&amp;amp;#39;re early in crypto, or its the wave of the future, head on over to the buttcoin sub and read the perspective of others.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The echochamber is one of the worst things about crypto. People get so excited to be involved &amp;amp;quot;early&amp;amp;quot; in a project, but this can lead to some massive emotional bias to overlook the more important fundamentals. By the time you realise the &amp;amp;#39;FUD&amp;amp;#39; was truth, it&amp;amp;#39;s too late.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Don&amp;amp;#39;t believe anyone. Not even me.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Every single comment I&amp;amp;#39;ve made on this post has been downvoted to hell.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Just scroll down and look.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci is reportedly devoting nearly half of his firm’s $3.5 billion worth of assets under management to Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Algorand (ALGO) and crypto-related stocks. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In addition to this, the hedge fund has a lot of belief in Algorand and went on to say:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;“I’ve got a quarter-billion dollars in Algorand right now. I think Algorand will be the Google… Algorand to me is the future. It’s just going to require more and more people doing deep dive due diligence and making the decision to choose it.”&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Scaramucci predicts Algorand will eventually challenge leading competitors in the crypto industry just as Google did in the early days of the internet. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What are your thoughts on investing a cool  $250,000,000.00 in Algorand? Do you think this is a wise move or the hedge fund sees sense?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Panama banking used to be the best in the world for secrecy. Better than Switzerland. But Pablo Escobar pushed the boundaries and helped put an end to all that. The US drug war with Colombia and the cartel’s Panama banking partnership ended when the US threatened sanctions and a gray zone status with all their allies. So the Panamese relented to financial imperialism, seized Escobar’s money, and in the process sullied their reputation like the Swiss and Hong Kongese have done recently. International courts back in the 80s gave no voice to Latin America.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/5nzt0pyipcw81.jpg?width=1140&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e939917a6af288c637f40c839031ba280fcbc4a6&quot;&amp;gt;Sorry Bitcoin Beach City, Panama City is the place to be for Latin companies&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then in 2010, more imperialism flexed: the first Obama Administration made good on their campaign promise of closing tax loopholes and introduced &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;FACTA&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, which hurt Panama quite a bit. This is how I was first introduced to bitcoin. I was permanently banned from Western Union and Moneygram, and placed on an international remittance blacklist. This had to do with the fact I was in the employ of an offshore casino, helping with their double-entry ledger. Bitcoin was a way out. The first casino I worked for went bust because they used a Japanese exchange called Mt. Gox (this was after I left). The second casino went bust in under 6 months because they tried fractionally reserving BTC. This doesn’t work with volatile and deflationary assets though, because as soon as it moved upwards, they were liable for the USD amount for customers looking to cash-out. If memory serves me, the price doubled from November 2011 to February 2012, and it was the second Patriots vs. Giants Super-Bowl game where the latter pulled an upset, de-collateralizing the sportsbook entirely because the wager imbalance was expected to balance out the shady BTC accounting. The third casino blew up because they laundered the Sinaloa’s money via low odds bets (-1000 and lower), and through a sophisticated web sent them to companies the Flores twins in Chicago owned, who eventually turned state’s evidence against El Chapo. The owner of that casino unsurprisingly ended up six-feet-under. The crazy thing is the Sinaloa didn’t use bitcoin in their scheme, because they’d lost a fortune when Silk Road was dismantled, and an operation they ran there went rogue, using the chaos to go dark, emerging as an entirely new competing cartel, keeping the Silk Road profits to seed themselves. The CIA then took the opportunity to run a highly effective disinformation campaign in Mexico-Colombia-Bolivia called &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Tenderscore,&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; proposing bitcoin was a secret US government project designed to dismantle cartels. They also spread the lie that El Chapo’s second imprisonment in Mexico (he escaped) was due to bitcoin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/xj57cmvfocw81.jpg?width=1199&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=61ab4c0f0efb62d5583fe4ef3ca28489de3b8c0b&quot;&amp;gt;Satoshi literally disappeared this same week&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To this day that operation has lingering effects, and that’s the reason why cartels have, to the confusion of many, been so analog and slow to adopt cryptocurrency. Consider the leading privacy coin&amp;amp;#39;s market cap and tx volume--both abysmal. There were legitimate concerns back then by the US government that cartels might swap their $50B-$100B annual profits into BTC, and that in a few short years, it could emerge as collateral, putting both NAFTA and USD demand at risk in Latin America. Real talk. Of course I had nothing to do with any of this stuff. I’m Romanian with a degree from Fordham NY. And it’s very possible the sources I got this information from were dishonest. I also have no contact with these individuals and didn’t even know their real names.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyway, back to Panama’s recent BTC law. It’s important why? Because the barrier for entry is quite low for Latin American COMPANIES. Panama isn’t like El Salvador, which is to say they don&amp;amp;#39;t have blackouts every other week, spotty internet, bad roads, crime everywhere, dirty water, ersatz medical care, untrustworthy banking infrastructure, a president that live-tweets BTC trades, or a government seemingly always on the cusp of instability--the latter of which is important because instability can also mean a new administration that waltzes in and bans everything. For individual plebs, getting a Panamanian visa is too expensive. It’s achieved through what’s called the &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Friendly Nation’s Program.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; It requires $5000 to be deposited in a Panamanian bank (most are now taking BTC deposits as well), then developing an economic tie. This tie is buying a $200k+ property, or investing $200k in the country, or being employed by a company there. That’s not important though, what’s important is that with Panama&amp;amp;#39;s law, we finally have a legit pawn to e4 move. This is a place that Latin American exchanges will relocate to, with plenty of talk already. Game theory suggests the way we get major countries in the Americas (US, Mexico, Canada) to adopt legal tender or zero taxes, are for three places to do it first, ranked in terms of importance:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Puerto Rico&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Panama&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Cuba&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Puerto Rico&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;: because no passport is required for Americans, and no up-front costs, yet PR enjoys all the global relationships the US does. They&amp;amp;#39;re prepping their own BTC laws and are interested in adding BTC as a means to purchase large items like real estate. &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;“The Monte Carlo of the Americas,”&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; one politician recently mused. Great place for remote work and excellent demographics for blockchain work.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/oef5gwctucw81.jpg?width=1200&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=a81f3b7f32464690292c9ab2adc3742cc3405d76&quot;&amp;gt;Puerto Rico&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/why-are-cryptocurrency-evangelists-flocking-to-puerto-rico-5pcfhsfnc&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/why-are-cryptocurrency-evangelists-flocking-to-puerto-rico-5pcfhsfnc&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Panama&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;: because it&amp;amp;#39;s the well-established banking epicenter of Central America and many Latin American countries. It’s an excellent anchorage for tokenized securities settled in bitcoin (like bonds, companies, and products). The prize of these would be Venezuelan oil bonds, because they have the largest proven oil reserves in the world and enormous gasoline refining capacity. All have been degraded obviously, but they need big investment with no strings. 3.5M bpd in the 90s all the way down to 160k now. Their currency has been stable for months because of oil prices.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Cuba&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;: because of their close ties with Russia, Florida, the Florida political establishment, and Latin America at large. Cuba&amp;amp;#39;s currency is also more volatile than bitcoin is, so it&amp;amp;#39;s an excellent place to make inroads, prove utility, and brag about--because of the regime it hopes to undo.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Kudos to El Salvador for being the beta that taught everyone else what worked and what didn&amp;amp;#39;t. They were an important step. 🪦&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When these three get orange pilled, things get interesting, because I don’t see how bitcoin taxes are more than symbolic legalese and completely unenforceable. Yes you can achieve this already with a hard wallet and DEX (I&amp;amp;#39;d know), but a bitcoin circular economy has not arrived just yet. If I make any major purchases, I’m not allowing a government to swipe 30% off the top so they can send it to support a growing foreign war, pay interest on their debt, or bailout commodity traders. When they can articulate the where and what for, in a transparent way, I’ll gladly pay taxes. Until then, you better find someone that can hack my brain or a ColdCard, because my seeds exist nowhere else, have never touched a live internet connection or internet connected device, and never will. PSBT’s rock. And I now live on a bitcoin standard—which took a couple years to figure out.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/plnthcw5pcw81.png?width=4032&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=faf0e8bc5d9329cb621be3ae9e844bf98a4d7b83&quot;&amp;gt;That&amp;amp;#39;s a power cord that goes into a 9V battery, not a connection.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I’m not buying a new $100k boat in the US for $110k after sales taxes, and $150k after capital gains taxes. That’s called financial irresponsibility and starts costing more than the price of dual citizenships or visas with none of the benefits. I’d rather have five S19j miners to go along with the boat. The tax exemption in these countries will allow individuals and companies to maneuver in ways which heretofore have been the privilege of billionaires and banks, from collateralizing your BTC to dispatching liquidity that LN channels want to borrow, all in the language the masses understand: tap, swipe, click. The day is coming when you’ll tell a startup—“&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Okay, so I have ten million sats in lending power.”&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;—and it’ll be a significant sum to part with. That’ll be this decade.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you’re HODLing bitcoin now, look around your group, your family, the circle you run with. You’re the person who will lead them. You are the first mover. You’re the person who will support them. You’re the alpha. This, by the way, does come with responsibility and sacrifice:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Nazmul Islam, forecasting analyst at Insider Intelligence, attributed the increase to new apps that make purchasing cryptocurrency much easier, combined with the popularity of meme coins. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is expected by the end of 2022, the number of US adults who own at least one cryptocurrency will climb 19.0% to 33.7 million.  That equates to 12.8% of the population, having surpassed 10% last year. The largest ownership group will be adults ages 25 to 34, followed by those ages 35 to 44. The smallest but fastest-growing group will be adults ages 65 and over. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/jqr5f5r349w81.png?width=925&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=784c61dc2c06e69ed2323836110459b02778c158&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/jqr5f5r349w81.png?width=925&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=784c61dc2c06e69ed2323836110459b02778c158&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Looking to the future, Islam said that younger people were more optimistic about crypto and were buying it to hold for the long term, whereas older investors were generally more skeptical and risk-averse but were increasingly adding them to retirement funds. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/wqdm1c7d49w81.png?width=922&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=47a4108a00ac8813f44825c8394fd3f6f7b67f14&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/wqdm1c7d49w81.png?width=922&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=47a4108a00ac8813f44825c8394fd3f6f7b67f14&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“Younger investors have a genuine positive outlook on blockchain technology and are buying crypto to hold for a while, expecting prices to continue increasing in the long run,” says Islam.  “Older investors will be more risk-averse and leery of the volatile crypto market. Although, they are increasingly starting to invest in crypto as more retirement funds offer it as an option.” &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/4ala8ymf49w81.png?width=922&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=0c7f5801e4b06e6cfc99cafee33a8f3425ca473b&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/4ala8ymf49w81.png?width=922&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=0c7f5801e4b06e6cfc99cafee33a8f3425ca473b&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Following triple-digit growth last year, crypto payment transaction value globally will surge 70.5% in 2022 to reach $10.40 billion. By the end of 2023, transaction value will grow another 55.4% to exceed $16 billion.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This year, 3.6 million US adults will use cryptocurrency to make a purchase, up 68.6% over last year. That means 10.7% of crypto owners will actually use a cryptocurrency to make a purchase. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/s53mu0gl49w81.png?width=922&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=b59594e13fe22872e9dbe5303040841155a98488&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/s53mu0gl49w81.png?width=922&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=b59594e13fe22872e9dbe5303040841155a98488&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Insights from the study showed a bullish picture for the future of crypto adoption, as well as showcasing the assets users are buying:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;3.6 million people are expected to make crypto payments in 2022, an increase of 69% (nice) from last year.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Payments made using cryptocurrencies will surpass $10 billion in total transaction value globally for the first time this year.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;25-34 was the largest demographic for crypto ownership — making up 11 million of US crypto holders.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The 65+ demographic was the smallest, with just 1.7% adoption rates.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Bitcoin is the most popular asset with 25.2 million holders.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Ethereum, the second-most popular asset, will reportedly have 13.1 million owners this year.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The former United States defense contractor was among the other six participants, including Zcash creator Zooko Wilcox, Bitcoin core developer Peter Todd, and Coin Center’s Peter Van Valkenburgh. All of them received a part of the private key needed to create Zcash.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Allegedly, Snowden didn&amp;amp;#39;t get any compensation, and his involvement was just for the public interest. In his interview with Zcash Media Snowden said: “The reason that I did that was I saw it being worked on by a number of trusted academic cryptographers. And I thought it was a very interesting project because when we look at cryptocurrencies in general, we generally see the cryptographic properties is being used to make sure it’s a fair ledger, but not that it’s been used to ensure that it’s a private ledger. The problem with that is you can’t have free trade unless you have private trade and you can’t have a free society without a free trade.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What is your opinion on Snowden&amp;amp;#39;s role in Zcash?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We all know that this is absolutely not true, and it got me thinking about a very exciting second order effect of Bitcoin nation state adoption.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Basically, it becomes much harder for governments to launder money and be corrupt because of the public nature of the Bitcoin ledger of transactions. Government spending, donations, foreign aid can be tracked on the blockchain.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On the other hand, citizens now enjoy more financial freedom, and can have a good level of pricacy using the Lightning Network.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The government isn&amp;amp;#39;t going to be able to track millions of average people&amp;amp;#39;s transactions on Lightning. This offers a level of privacy comparable to cash. But millions of people can now have their eyes on their government, who&amp;amp;#39;s not going to be able to move millions around unnoticed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;More privacy for the individuals, more transparency for governments. Win-win.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What do you guys think?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: I chose that title because it is a well known quote. I do not support coercive governments, elected or not, but if we&amp;amp;#39;re going to have governments I&amp;amp;#39;d rather have the balance of power tilted more towards people and I think Bitcoin will do just that. &amp;amp;quot;Democracy&amp;amp;quot; definitely isn&amp;amp;#39;t the end game for freedom as far as I&amp;amp;#39;m concerned. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

If BTC had hit 150k, I&amp;amp;#39;d probably agree with the sentiment here, but this is not the case.
BTC peaked at around 70k. The market cap is way too small for what BTC already represents for the world economy.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here is what I expect is gonna happen. The stock market will continue to struggle while investors will look for alternative investments. Since crypto is extremely undervalued, it will decouple from the stock market soon which will create a positive feedback loop, where the more investors move from stocks to crypto, the better crypto performs, which will result in more investors turning to crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Most people who think crypto winter already started have already sold or wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t have sold anyway.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Therefore the rest of the year is going to get exciting. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
