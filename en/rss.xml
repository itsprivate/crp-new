&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Former US presidential candidate – Hillary Clinton – criticized those cryptocurrency trading venues that refused to stop servicing Russian-based users. She once again opined that digital assets should be put under a regulatory framework.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Amidst the Russian invasion in Ukraine, Mykhailo Fedorov – the latter’s Vice Prime Minister – asked the leading digital asset platforms to freeze all Russian users’ blockchain addresses. According to the politician, the move would weaken Russia and aid Ukraine’s defense.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In a recent interview for MSNBC, the former first lady Hillary Clinton said she is “disappointed” that some cryptocurrency exchanges still provide services to such users:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Why do these people talk about thinga they have not a single inkling about? And clearly any sort of decentralization is poisoni their eyes&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Except this is not whats happening, and on the contrary its Ukraine thats using crypto for good. Yet none of these Senators celebrate crypto for what its actually being used for, but instead create a non-story to serve their vested interests of slamming crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How pathetic could all of this get? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;She just wants an opportunity to somehow link it to hit out against crypto. Using her public and visible position to spread her own agenda when the country thats most affected by whats going on is actually  using crypto for the betterment of its people in the present terrible situation. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/wqgx98gwssk81.jpg?width=1198&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=699dcd94d491efbe6d57968d1606ba9cbd1aea67&quot;&amp;gt;Infact, just now Ukraine took up on Gavin Wood&amp;amp;#39;s generous offer too. &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And was able to find a bit of humor even in circumstances such as now..&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: There are of course a possibility that this could happen, but as of now there is no evidence that it is happening. Nor is it likely in the future, infact Russia is more likely to use China&amp;amp;#39;s SWIFT replacement known as CIPS - Cross-Border Interbank Payment System, or use their own SWIFT replacement SPFS (less likely as low liquidity).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPFS&quot;&amp;gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPFS&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; - Russian Central Bank has already said SPFS could be an option, and 23 countries foreign banks are already connected to it. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;USA is already the largest liquid crypto markets, if Russia starts accepting crypto for their strategically important export oil, they wont have any places to spend their crypto as the liquid USD-crypto market is already closed for them. Whats the point of earning say 10,000 crypto coins for a million barrels of oil, if they cant spend it anywhere due to lack of counterparties willing to trade with them? Russian Ruble - crypto pairs are non-existent today. Also, they cant use that crypto to buy commodities from other countries either, as these countries could come under risk of sanction themselves, and furthermore high volume crypto-commodity market is also non-existent right now. No country is going to be ready to start accepting say 10m  tonnes of Wheat for Crypto. Such a scenario is not even possible right now given the structure of crypto markets.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That is why it is important for USA to actually build dominance in crypto markets, and yet you have people like Liz spinning up a&amp;amp;quot;crypto is bad&amp;amp;quot; narrative whenever they get the chance to do    &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Being afraid of Russia using crypto to evade sanctions is literally being scared of the boogeyman, especially when CIPS and SPFS offer much more immediate options for them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The article mostly talks about how Bitcoin is a huge pump and dump scheme and you know how it&amp;amp;#39;s a scam.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;I’m tired of saying, “Be careful, it’s speculative.” Then, “Be careful, it’s gambling.” Then, “Be careful, it’s a bubble.” Okay, I’ll say it: Bitcoin is a scam.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Followed by&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Bitcoins are accepted almost nowhere, and some cryptocurrencies nowhere at all.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Well we have seen how it turned out to be with global adoption very close and crypto helping a crisis in the world right now.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But what is interesting is another Vox&amp;amp;#39;s  article years later &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/recode/22383757/bitcoin-coinbase-ipo-crypto-ethereum-cryptocurrency&quot;&amp;gt;Like it or not, you should probably start paying attention to bitcoin&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s mostly a Coin base shill but it proves  how awfully wrong and manipulative media can be.  Being updated with  crypto news could be helpful but it mostly fucks up your investment because of the constant confusion.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The best thing to do would be to consider media as entertainment and never to take any financial decision because of it. Especially Panic selling or fomoing no matter what the experts&amp;amp;quot; say.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Stick to your plan without getting manipulated into selling or buying because of news.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To get back to the initial $1000, your coin would have to jump by 100% from $500, which is a much longer journey than just 50%&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So even though we had a massive 15% BTC rally today, the 15% drop we had recently still feels much heavier. Sure, things will probably go back up to where they were, but just a friendly reminder that the market is not as symmetric as it looks like&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

After sanctions and severe economic restrictions placed on the nation and it&amp;amp;#39;s inhabitants by the rest of the world due to the invasion of Ukraine, crypto is pumping, and BTC alone is up 13% or so. On top of that, it&amp;amp;#39;s likely that a smaller percentage of that population are the ones buying given current worldwide so really the movement happened with a small percentage of that population amount. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If this event can cause this amount price of an increase, what happens when a global population of a little under 8 BILLION decides to adopt BTC as a hedge against uncertainty and war or simply as a means to transact with minimal fees in a transparent and decentralized way? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here is a hopium induced thought, what if the change in BTC price today was true and held a similar linear relationship with each approximate 2% increase in adoption (measured by the corresponding increase in % of world population)? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Alright, so I gave this simple model a try. I increased world population at 2%. I then found a multiplication factor by dividing the increase in BTC price by the percentage of the population that adopted today presumably and just assumed that would hold true for each 2% adoption. I then carried that out through 2% intervals until we got close to full world adoption and found a value for BTC assuming a spot price of $43,000.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/0zoq5m72yok81.png?width=1500&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=a7075db314300dc435d6679ed7a64f6bf4373ef3&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/0zoq5m72yok81.png?width=1500&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=a7075db314300dc435d6679ed7a64f6bf4373ef3&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;d say there is a pretty bright future as seen above and this is with an extremely limited/rudimentary model with lot&amp;amp;#39;s of assumptions. I think that answer is conservative because of halving, significant future inflation, and other factors of demand and BTC&amp;amp;#39;s scarce supply. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They&amp;amp;#39;ve since DCA&amp;amp;#39;d back into the market (with $533m) and are now $718m in profit ($1.2b total).

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yes I am talking about the sudden burst of anger from many of you about how Gavin Wood, head of Polkadot, and Sunny Lu, head of VeChain, have asked for Ukraine to post an address for them to donate. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To be clear... Donate their OWN FUCKING MONEY. Ukraine has asked for donations in any way that they can. Food, ammunition, guns, resources, food and water, fighters, and any assistance possible to fight a much larger force. The only reason they initially posted the addresses to BTC and ETH is because those are the two biggest currencies. They will take whatever funds they can possibly get and that is EXACTLY what these two are doing. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If I hear one more person say, oh well they could have converted it to BTC or ETH first and then sent it... Why should they have to? They have a large portion of their own individual wealth in the coin they created, they should be able to send that to help out and not get ridiculed by internet trolls thousands of miles away. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Not like they would give a shit anyway if you disagree about how they have donated because lets me real, they are trying to make a difference.... What have you done?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Two more things, these are both respected projects! It&amp;amp;#39;s not like someone is asking them to set up a wallet for elonspermshitfuckidontcare coin. These are coins that have a lot of backing and are known. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Leads me into the follow up, now you know what address to send those coins to if you want to donate! Honestly, I hope Ukraine eventually posts address to lots of coins so that countless people can band together and donate what they have in order to help. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We are better than this people, show the world that crypto is united and what we can really do to help. Last time I checked, Ukraine is getting close to 40 million in crypto donations, I hope to see that number reach 100 million and beyond very soon.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyways, ever since the grand slam dump of a fall from what was an astonishing number for a coin like doge, It has been in a constant downtrend ever since. Now currently at $0.122 from it&amp;amp;#39;s ath of $0.68, thats a fall of nearly 70%!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/kadgk0cpelk81.png?width=891&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=15f4b2d6d0c637c624ea0a2c22859b6dea2952b7&quot;&amp;gt;Consistent downtrend (1D chart)&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There have been minor jumps and pumps along the way, but after every single jump, there&amp;amp;#39;s a even bigger dump. The gap between pumps have been becoming higher and higher, and the duration of the pump has shown to be shortening over time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Is it safe to say the era of not memecoins, but dogecoin in reference is over? I honestly don&amp;amp;#39;t think Elon or anyone for that matter would be able to bring back the hype of dogecoin as it was back in May. I personally know many people who bought at the top and still hold for the &amp;amp;quot;$1 dogecoin!&amp;amp;quot; line. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I although did hold through .07 and saw my investment hit the multi-thousands. I didn&amp;amp;#39;t sell because of that line, my knowledge in cryptocurrency tokenomics has a huge role in my decision making. I&amp;amp;#39;m still baffled that Dogecoin managed to pull off being in Top 3 cryptocurrencies, when you look at it now. That&amp;amp;#39;s crazy!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyways, just wanted to discuss my thoughts. What do you think? I don&amp;amp;#39;t think doge will ever go back up aside from the little pumps it may have, definitely not close to where it was at it&amp;amp;#39;s highest.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
