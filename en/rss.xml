&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;will it keep growing? one can only hope, but I would not hold my breath. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;for now we can cling to the idea of stabilizing somewhere above 20k. ETH is at 1111 dollar right now which is cool. such are these days which we have to celebrate ETH being more than 1000$. dark days indeed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;have a geat night/day folks&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;lets hope when you wake up next day BTC be around 22-23k or more.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Currently, Tether sits at a market cap of &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;$68 billion&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; at spot #3 and USDC coin sits at &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;$55 billion&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; at spot #4.  So USDC coin is within roughly &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$13 billion&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; away from unseating it!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With all the uncertainty and misery right now, the last thing we would need is a total Tether collapse, so it‚Äôs terrific to see USDC more widely utilized. Hopefully we can have a smooth fade away from Tether, rather than a ‚Äúrip the bandaid‚Äù period that could be much more destructive to the crypto environment.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Just some good news for you in a sea of red üòÖ&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m not rich - nor am I in the top 10 percent of income earners. I had some cash mostly left behind by my wonderful grandparents and my own money as well. Got greedy when I was up 20k in March and bought more. Learned a valuable lesson.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When you watch your portfolio drop past 50 percent it has an affect on you. I&amp;amp;#39;m at the stage where I&amp;amp;#39;ve accepted that this was meant to happen as a learning experience but it also solidified my determination for long term savings. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Ultimately it&amp;amp;#39;s a good thing because I would have spent the money on bullshit had I sold my gains before the crash. I&amp;amp;#39;m now taking a 10 year view on this technology. I hope to god that I&amp;amp;#39;ll not need any of it in the near to mid future - that&amp;amp;#39;s the only thing I worry about on occasion but at the same time I&amp;amp;#39;ve always worried about retirement and having nothing in the bank when I&amp;amp;#39;m too old.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I imagined anyone in the world being able to have a crypto bank account. No monthly fees, no depending on if the bank wants you or not, no paperwork requirements, no paying for bundle of services that you will never use, no predatory credit practices and so many other benefits.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I imagined people being able to transfer money with no boundaries. International money transfers can be such a pain in the ass and there all sorts of fees and random entities you have to trust in order to do it. Even if the money is yours you need a bank account in both countries.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I imagined people in countries with high inflation being able to have money that is stable and detached from the craziness in their countries. Venezuela comes to mind.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I wish there existed some coin with some built in mechanism that discouraged speculation so the price would be more stable and poor people could put their money on it without the risk of all the price fluctuations.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyway, what other real life uses you see for Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitcoin was made to have strong and incorruptible monetary policy, in the face of easy money.  With the way things are going, it seems like we&amp;amp;#39;re seeing things unravel in the global economy pretty much as Bitcoiners have been predicting since the beginning.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And yet the price of Bitcoin takes a massive shit as this drama unfolds, and we&amp;amp;#39;re all wondering where the bottom is, if it can be found at all.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s as if you have Rocky training for years and years for the big fight, endless montage, he&amp;amp;#39;s fucking shredded and ready to rumble.  But when he gets in the ring, he shits his pants and cries.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It just seems like these are the conditions that we&amp;amp;#39;ve all been preparing for, but it&amp;amp;#39;s just not going well so far.  We put our money into Bitcoin to have strength in the face of a financial downturn, but if you are holding Bitcoin right now, it&amp;amp;#39;s hard to find other investments that have been hit harder.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Stocks are now officially in a &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/glossary/bear-market&quot;&amp;gt;bear market&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; with no bottom in sight as it falls below the 20% &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/finance/quote/.INX:INDEXSP?window=YTD&quot;&amp;gt;threshold&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;High yield investment grade bonds are &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/finance/quote/HYG:NYSEARCA?window=YTD&quot;&amp;gt;collapsing&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, also with no end in sight. (Yes, 15% is a collapse in bond terms).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Even safe assets like 7-10 year treasuries are &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/finance/quote/IEF:NASDAQ?window=YTD&quot;&amp;gt;sinking&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; as well. My bond bros can back me up. A 12% drop in a &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;fixed&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; income ETF? That&amp;amp;#39;s really, really bad.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;National currencies like the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ifcmarkets.com/en/market-data/personal-instrument-pci-prices/jpy-index&quot;&amp;gt;Yen&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; aren&amp;amp;#39;t safe either.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Real estate and gold are the last legs to fall. Why are they last? Liquidity. Gold doesn&amp;amp;#39;t move very often and real estate tends to lag other assets due to its lengthier acquisition process. But we&amp;amp;#39;re already seeing signs that &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/finance/quote/VNQ:NYSEARCA?window=YTD&quot;&amp;gt;real estate&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; is going to tank.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

So if you&amp;amp;#39;re living outside America, I feel sorry for you, I really do. I have no advice other than try to get more $USD. For those in the States, here&amp;amp;#39;s what you should be doing going forward:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Don&amp;amp;#39;t&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; over leverage. That means don&amp;amp;#39;t borrow money, don&amp;amp;#39;t mortgage your house, and don&amp;amp;#39;t max out your credit cards if you can help it.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Do&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; cut spending and save as much cash as possible.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Don&amp;amp;#39;t&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; buy the dip. It&amp;amp;#39;s not a dip, it&amp;amp;#39;s a falling knife.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Do&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; re-evaluation your allocation. I&amp;amp;#39;ve put 10% of my net worth into crypto and it&amp;amp;#39;s now sitting at 5%. I don&amp;amp;#39;t plan on re-allocating back to 10% because I was clearly over-exposed. I&amp;amp;#39;m going to camp at 5% and see what happens next. I&amp;amp;#39;ll be moving the other 5% into cash.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Don&amp;amp;#39;t&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; panic sell. The time for selling has long passed. You lost that opportunity when BTC was at $40k. Now you fucking HODL.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Do&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; stay the course. Whatever your investment strategy was, make sure to re-assess and keep investing. Slowly and deliberately.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Don&amp;amp;#39;t&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; try to time the market. You can&amp;amp;#39;t. If you didn&amp;amp;#39;t sell at the top, then you sure as shit aren&amp;amp;#39;t buying at the bottom.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Do&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; diversify going forward. There is no such thing as a &amp;amp;quot;guarantee&amp;amp;quot; in investing and there is no one &amp;amp;quot;true&amp;amp;quot; asset. Otherwise, we&amp;amp;#39;d all be holding that one asset. All investments have risks of going to 0, never think otherwise.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Don&amp;amp;#39;t&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; beat yourself up. The bears are out in the woods today for a picnic and they&amp;amp;#39;ll be relentlessly mocking you. Every bear will suddenly be an expert who &amp;amp;quot;saw all this coming&amp;amp;quot; and they&amp;amp;#39;ll say that you were a fool to invest in &amp;amp;quot;tulip bulbs&amp;amp;quot;. Unless those bears actually made money from this crash, they&amp;amp;#39;re just shit talking cowards.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There&amp;amp;#39;s more pain to come, folks. Much more. We&amp;amp;#39;re nowhere near max pain, so don&amp;amp;#39;t get brave yet. Bitcoin is an asset like any other. Don&amp;amp;#39;t fall in love with it, don&amp;amp;#39;t feel emotional about it. If it&amp;amp;#39;s keeping you up at night, maybe consider trimming it. Thanks for listening to my Ted Talk.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thousands of new investors who entered the market in the 2025 bull run are googling the word &amp;amp;quot;capitulation&amp;amp;quot; for the first time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Elon Musk has announced he&amp;amp;#39;s running for president as a Republican in 2028, and has a pro crypto platform. Despite falling over 90% from its ATH, Elon continues to shill Dogecoin as a valid form of currency. His tweets no longer seem to have an effect on the price of Dogecoin as most investors now see his long lived obsession as being out of touch.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Centralized exchanges now only able to offer rates around 1 - 2% after all the SEC regulations that were put in place to protect consumers after the 2022 crash. This still attracts new investors looking to make some passive income on their bitcoin, despite the recommendation of seasoned crypto holders still bitter about having their funds frozen by Celsius.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The top posts on &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/cc&quot;&amp;gt;r/cc&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; are mostly meta posts about the community, criticizing other posts and judging perceived sentiment from members of the community. People will comment &amp;amp;quot;I bought bitcoin at 40K in 2022 and I&amp;amp;#39;m doing fine&amp;amp;quot;. Others will reply &amp;amp;quot;Wow, you have a lot of willpower not selling at 350K&amp;amp;quot;. For some this is true, and for others they just did a poor job taking profits and are content to wait it out until the next bull run.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;At least I learned some important lessons&amp;amp;quot;. They tell themselves. &amp;amp;quot;I&amp;amp;#39;ll change my strategy and do better next time&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;About 10 hours ago, CeIsius deposits 12 million DAI in the Maker contract and retrieves 6.7M LINK tokens.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fair enough, they are paying off an outstanding debt on Maker. To be expected if they were winding down and retrieving their users&amp;amp;#39; funds for  withdrawal.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But then they send it through a few wallets:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://etherscan.io/token/0x514910771af9ca656af840dff83e8264ecf986ca?a=0x41318419cfa25396b47a94896ffa2c77c6434040&quot;&amp;gt;https://etherscan.io/token/0x514910771af9ca656af840dff83e8264ecf986ca?a=0x41318419cfa25396b47a94896ffa2c77c6434040&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://etherscan.io/token/0x514910771af9ca656af840dff83e8264ecf986ca?a=0x019c4935ff1c4945f046c6784c08a40f1ab632a3&quot;&amp;gt;https://etherscan.io/token/0x514910771af9ca656af840dff83e8264ecf986ca?a=0x019c4935ff1c4945f046c6784c08a40f1ab632a3&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://etherscan.io/token/0x514910771af9ca656af840dff83e8264ecf986ca?a=0x76a05277b81b9ca6c06c9ab4136116fc53e9c9e1&quot;&amp;gt;https://etherscan.io/token/0x514910771af9ca656af840dff83e8264ecf986ca?a=0x76a05277b81b9ca6c06c9ab4136116fc53e9c9e1&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And where is this $40M in Chainlink sent? Surely, back to the CeIsius wallets so the users can withdraw their funds, right? No.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They sent it to FTX.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;CeIsius has learned nothing. They are not unwinding. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;They  are speculating with their users&amp;amp;#39; deposits by openly shorting what  their own users have deposited with them, on the open market.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Okex&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Nexo&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; are doing exactly the same.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://etherscan.io/token/0x0b8f12b1788BFdE65Aa1ca52E3e9F3Ba401be16D#balances&quot;&amp;gt;https://etherscan.io/token/0x0b8f12b1788BFdE65Aa1ca52E3e9F3Ba401be16D#balances&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All the top Aave LINK shorts are funded directly from Okex wallets (Funded in 1 day with much more than user withdrawal limits)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

This alone accounts for a huge % of borrowing on Solana, and now this position is under a liquidation threat. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The whale is not closing their position. In most protocols like Compound, or AAVE, Maker etc, this will result in an onchain liquidation. Infact we have seen many such large liquidations on AAVE And Maker recently, and everything has worked as expected. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However such a large liquidation in an illiquid market and unstable network like Solana is likely to have vastly damaging consequences. Solana network has already gone down and halted half a dozen time. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Solend team explains what could happen to the network:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This  could cause chaos, putting a strain on the Solana network. Liquidators  would be especially active and spamming the liquidate function, which  has been known to be a factor causing Solana to go down in the past.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Letting a liquidation of this size to happen on-chain is extremely risky.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;  DEX liquidity isn‚Äôt deep enough to handle a sale of this size and could  cause cascading effects. Additionally, liquidators will be incentivized  to spam the network in an effort to win very lucrative liquidations.  This has been known to cause load issues for Solana in the past which  would exacerbate the problems at hand.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So to prevent this, they are proposing to literally steal the user&amp;amp;#39;s funds and execute OTC trades:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Grant  emergency power to Solend Labs to temporarily take over the whale‚Äôs  account so the liquidation can be executed OTC and avoid pushing Solana  to its limits. This would be done via a smart contract upgrade.  Emergency powers will be revoked once the whale‚Äôs account reaches a safe  level.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When shit starts to implode, all the true colors of decentralization comes out. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These shitty protocol are run by fly by night cowboys who learnt basics of economics during the bull run. They put their users are risk by running terrible protocols that do not think about all the edge cases...because who cares about risks right?! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And during signs of distress, they resolve to seize user funds.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I‚Äôm wondering how we arrived at such a divisive place, if we should be worried that the rhetoric is becoming overwhelmingly negative and polarized, and if Reddit is analogous main stream sentiment. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Part of what gives anything value is the belief that it has value. As amazing as the theory and tech side of crypto is, with its potential to revolutionize and disrupt archaic systems, if people simply emotionally decide it‚Äôs worthless, then it could become a self fulfilling prophecy of sorts.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Fair enough, that&amp;amp;#39;s usually the case.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But combined with this relative &amp;amp;quot;calm&amp;amp;quot; amongst people in the crypto sphere as of yet, what we&amp;amp;#39;re also seeing is altcoins holding the line in an unprecedented way. I thought it was just a few coins like LINK and ADA who were doing well. But I was just made aware of the fact that out of the top 100 on CMC, only 10 and 5 coins have &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;worse&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; performing 7-day metrics than BTC and ETH respectively. Yes, you read that right. In this gigantic downturn, when BTC just broke it&amp;amp;#39;s previous ATH which has never happened before, a time when there should be absolute doubt and panic, only 10 (!!!) coins have a worse 7-day performance than btc. This is unprecedented.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What I&amp;amp;#39;m also reading a lot of, and a good point someone else made whose name I forgot, is that BTC and ETH are crashing because that&amp;amp;#39;s where all the liquidations happen.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I don&amp;amp;#39;t know about you, but BTC could drop another 70%, and so could all my alts, but the time for selling has been long gone, and in fact, even if BTC dropped another 70%, I would be buying. Not BTC, but more alts. Because the ones I have, I have no doubt about their future, so why wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t I? Fucking bargain! It&amp;amp;#39;s kinda funny because earlier I actually caught myself being irritated at LINK because it wasn&amp;amp;#39;t dropping as hard as BTC, preventing me to scoop them up cheaper.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My point is, this crash doesn&amp;amp;#39;t seem to be caused by doubtful panic like all the times before. We know what we have. And we&amp;amp;#39;re not going to part with it. And given all this I just don&amp;amp;#39;t feel that the thesis, that we need this whole sub to panic in order to find a bottom, to hold this time around. I&amp;amp;#39;ve been here  since 2013 (I know, anecdotal), but something feels different. I don&amp;amp;#39;t see myself suddenly start panicking if btc drops another 50%, you? The doubt and fear that we had all previous crashes is pretty much gone. This is just shitty liquidations happening, and who knows when they might stop.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now of course, naysayers might say that this very post is proof of the fact that we&amp;amp;#39;re not near a bottom yet. Fair enough. But that doesn&amp;amp;#39;t change the very different situation we seem to find ourselves in as described above this time around.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I‚Äôve been reminded a lot lately that there‚Äôs no law stating that markets must behave how they have in the past.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I‚Äôve not invested a sum that I cannot afford to lose and it‚Äôs not like my livelihood will come under risk because of this crash.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But I do feel scared being in my first crypto bear market. I do not plan on selling and have moved my coins from exchanges. Yet I feel scared. For the first time seeing those price drops literally scares me.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I‚Äôm not planning on getting out but I‚Äôve learned some hard lessons like take profits on your alts and don‚Äôt get greedy. And also never be married to a position.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Previous bear market survivors did you feel the same during your first bear market?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also other people in a similar position to me keep strong.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: Thanks to the person who referred to to suicide watch. However, I‚Äôm definitely not in that state of mind. So no worries. Just felt bad looking at all that value just straight up decrease day after day.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I&amp;amp;#39;ve been waiting for fewer &amp;amp;quot;buy the dip&amp;amp;quot; &amp;amp;quot;hodl&amp;amp;quot; and I ‚ù§Ô∏è BTC posts.  This signifies to me that folks are very afraid.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m feeling very greedy.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But... I&amp;amp;#39;m also being cautious.  It is quite possible for BTC to move down to around $10k again.  For instance, if this drawback parallels the high of previous bull markets, $12k is in sight.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However, I cannot time a bottom.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;No one can pick a bottom.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I can only smell fear.  I buy when I smell fear. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However, part of me feels like people are not afraid enough.... There are LESS posts about buying at these prices here on this sub... I do believe we will eventually get to a point where there will be none.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Until then, I&amp;amp;#39;ll keep NIBBLING.  Little chunks (5% of my total BTC bankroll at a time).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Plaintiff Nick Patterson is alleging, among other accusations, that Terra tokens were sold as unregistered securities, and that the Defendants made a series of false and misleading statements regarding the largest Terra ecosystem digital assets by market cap, UST and LUNA, in order to induce investors into purchasing these digital assets at inflated rates.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I am a big fan of taking profits and regularly skimming the cream from the top of my portfolio.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Let&amp;amp;#39;s do a little thought experiment. Suppose you were a super unlucky bastard and bought 1 BTC at $20,000 back in the 2017/2018 cycle. BTC goes parabolic during a pandemic and hits $67,000. What&amp;amp;#39;s so bad with selling 10% for example? or 20% of your entire stack?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I bet some people will say &amp;amp;#39;but it&amp;amp;#39;s impossible to time the market and to hit the exact top&amp;amp;#39;. OK sure, it&amp;amp;#39;s very difficult. But BTC was over $50,000 from the 5th of October 2021 to the 10th of December 2021. That&amp;amp;#39;s two months to make that decision. Two months is a looong time. And it was above 60k for over a month. If someone sold 10% of their 1 BTC during that time (without hitting the exact top at all) they&amp;amp;#39;d still have 0.9 BTC remaining in their wallet and around $5000-6000 dollars in their pocket. You just put that into a stablecoin and keep it for later. Patience is a virtue. And timing the market is not that very hard really. The moment everyone in your family, at work, on the news and every celebrity is talking about it. When people talk about crypto during Saturday Night Live you know this is the time to get the hell out of the crypto space. When your grandma asks you about the magic internet money that&amp;amp;#39;s your signal to get the hell out. ASAP.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now comes June 2022. BTC is under $20k again. You can use that $5000 and buy another 0.25 BTC for practically free. Now you have 1.15 BTC for the next cycle and you can keep it to retire or whatever. Assuming that you&amp;amp;#39;ve never DCA&amp;amp;#39;d in the last 4-5 years you still have 1.15 BTC in your pocket. Now you can sell 0.15 BTC during the next cycle to skim profits again when BTC hits $100,000 for example. And you&amp;amp;#39;ll still have your initial 1 BTC safe in your wallet for your retirement. Now you can put down a deposit for your first house with that $25,000. Or buy a car, or go for a nice long holiday. Whatever. Anything you want.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But be aware that taking profits does feel bad sometimes, especially when prices continue to go up. And I know this from my personal experience, I felt really bad when I sold my ETH at $1400, $1700, and again at $2500 marks. Because it went over $4000 later. But you know what? I&amp;amp;#39;ve still made over 450% in profits. And now ETH dropped below $1k. I can either keep my 450% profit in stablecoins or I can buy 4.5 more ETH than I had before from my 450% profit that I&amp;amp;#39;ve skimmed. Now, it doesn&amp;amp;#39;t feel so bad anymore. I hope you get my point. Sure it would be nice to sell at $4k and make 900% or 1400% profit but like I said it&amp;amp;#39;s very hard to predict the market and hit the exact top. So why not just chill and skim some profits from time to time?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TAKE PROFIT NEXT TIME PEOPLE it&amp;amp;#39;s not that hard.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I don‚Äôt think crypto will go up a reasonable amount while the stock market is losing value. We could very well be on our way to $10k here in the next month or two. Ethereum at $500 is a very reasonable price target abs Bitcoin at $10,000.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Don‚Äôt invest in alt coins. You‚Äôll be able to get them at pennies on the dollar. This summer will not be kind to crypto. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I hope I‚Äôm wrong and this post will make crypto change course but I doubt it. This is the time when real money is made. Time to average down and lower your cost basis greatly. Be safe out there people!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And   look what happens every single day. Bitcoin just keeps falling. Like   you guys gotta stop being in your own bubble pretending everything is   okay.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you come over the to the   stock side (which is much less risky btw) you will see that we are able   to actually be intellectual when stocks are down. We know the reason   that stocks are red and we keep investing in stocks logically for   reasons like the company has good fundamentals and has equity and low   debt to get through a recession.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some   of you just need to snap out of it and realize that bitcoin is so much   more riskier than any other form of investment, and if you speculate  you  just make it worse.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Perhaps they thought things were stable as people wait out the two weeks before finding out whether or not the US is officially in a recession.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then they went home. Some went to party with co-workers to de-stress after a week of nonsense. Most are now in bed, dreaming.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Tomorrow, their time, they will wake up to a new nightmare to add to what had already happened.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I understand that you can use a cold storage to protect your crypto, just as you can use paper cash to protect your cash. But at some point you will need to make a transfer and use an exchange or a bank and your crypto or money can be locked out. What is the difference then?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;2 - People say that CBDCs will give more power to governemnts. In most countries if you get your social security or similar blocked by the governemnt you can&amp;amp;#39;t do anything in the financial system, so I believe governments already have all the power they need to block your financial life. And I would rather put my money on a CBDC than on a project such as Terraluna or similar. What&amp;amp;#39;s the advantage of crypto or stablecoins here?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;3 - Transactions fees are enourmous for Bitcoin and Etherium, sometimes even more expensive than using a traditional bank. Fintechs can offer international transfers, regardless of the amount being transferred for a flat fee. What&amp;amp;#39;s the advantage of crypto in this regard?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;4 - Store of value. Nothing with the extreme volatily of Bitcoin, Etherium, etc can be considered a good store of value. A store of value implies low volatility and an asset that at least keep up with inflation. I often see people comparing the rise of Bitcoin price vs the loss of value of the US dollar and other currencies. This is a fallacy. Bitcoin gained value since its invention but it doesn&amp;amp;#39;t mean that if you bought it a month ago as a store of value it did its job. Crypto in general are looking more like shares than a store of value. It goes up and it goes down, to make money you either time it right or hold it for decades. What am I missing here?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;5 - Exchanges get hacked or go bust and there is no one to turn to to have your crypto back. With banks the government guarantees up to a certain amount of your cash if the bank goes under.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;hr/&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m very sincere with my questions and I really would like to hear good and adult counter arguments.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cheers&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
