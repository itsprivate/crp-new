&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I am an educated health care worker, I make a good living, I could make far more if I dedicated my life to  fucking people over at any cost for the sole purpose of getting rich as fuck, but I instead, chose to dedicate my professional career to alleviating the suffering of my fellow man. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It would be pretty cool if working class professionals could make a good living wage (apparently a hard ask), but punishing them multiple times as they try to rise up into a life of stressing less about money, is so ass backwards. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The system is so fucked up, and 100000000000000000% stacked against the working class, we are basically techno-serfs at this point.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Shiba Inu.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In his official statement to the Russian press Vlad said &amp;amp;quot;my advisers say the Rouble is basically a shitcoin at this point. Whatever that means. So i asked them to DYOR. They reported back that they found the perfect solution. Shiba Inu. Whilst they say Shiba is the true shitcoin of the crypto world, apparently it is the second most volatile currency other than the Rouble. So it&amp;amp;#39;s basically an upgrade to the Rouble. As they say, a better shitcoin is better than a shitcoin&amp;amp;quot;!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After the announcement, Shiba Inu has shot up 3000 percent finally proving 14 year old kids right that Shib has mooned to a dollar.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The world is now coming to terms with the fact red bull chugging 14 year olds now control 95 percent of the world&amp;amp;#39;s wealth.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Is it because people expect the value to just 100X within the first month of holding it during the relative infancy of a project? Projects can take years and years to develop and grow. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In August of 2015, ETH was a little over $.70, and it took two years to get to $270. I&amp;amp;#39;m sure you&amp;amp;#39;re thinking, &amp;amp;quot;Oh, that&amp;amp;#39;s not long, I would have held. &amp;amp;quot;, but in the same breath, declare an alt dead after a few months. I&amp;amp;#39;m not saying every alt is destined for ETH&amp;amp;#39;s success, but I don&amp;amp;#39;t think we can predict their future success in such a short time. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I think some of these projects we all talk about, the good ones, can get up there, but I&amp;amp;#39;m ready to wait years to see it happen. More often than not, great success can be made on the back of failure. Projects will have growing pains; that&amp;amp;#39;s just the nature of business. Nothing goes straight up and stays up. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One bit of it that caught me by surprise is..&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;On the contrary, Polygon’s network consumes approximately 0.00079 TWh annually — over 100,000 times less energy use than the Ethereum network. By contrast, this is significantly less than even a modest data center would require for yearly operations. &amp;amp;quot; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;(sources to both claims linked in the article)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The speed and low gas fees alone honestly makes me bullish on Polygon as a blockchain, that coupled with the above statement as well ++&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Currently it is in beta and not offered to all users. It is a subscription service that costs $29.99/month and will waive all trading fees on the app(still could be effected by spread) and it will protect your account against unauthorized access up to $1,000,000 worth. It also says 24/7 customer phone support too.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I don&amp;amp;#39;t see myself using this since I hardly buy on the app and use cb pro for my crypto buys. Even with the 0.5% fee and spread fee I would need to be buying at least $6000 in non stablecoin crypto to make it worth the monthly subscription fee.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The added protection is a good selling point though that makes me consider it since I mainly keep about $2000 in USDC on there to pay my bills with their coinbase card for the 4% cashback. Knowing that my card/funds are safe from unauthorized hacks is nice. I&amp;amp;#39;m not one to be hacked though and haven&amp;amp;#39;t had any issues with my CB account in the 4-5 years I have had it and the 9~ months I have had the card&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Think about where India could be if these people were not forced out of the country because it&amp;amp;#39;s still too backward to support tech innovation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;India missed out on leading the world in the 90s with the internet. India will once again miss out on leading the world in Bitcoin and crypto innovation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I read the Indian Finance Minister saying the tax laws are supposed to discourage gambling in crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Well congrats! With your ignorance and short sighted thinking you have just screwed your country out of the biggest opportunity to turn India into a first world country and global superpower.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Will any Bitcoin and crypto startup invest in India now? No chance in hell! You will lose trillions of dollars of investments and even more brain power will leave India and support foreign economies.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I feel sorry for people in India. You should look to move to progressive countries that are not afraid of innovation and have the courage to lead.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;India is doomed to be a poor country forever because of third world mentality. What a waste when so many smart people come from India.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Satoshi might be able to reveal himself, to let us all know who he/she/they is/are, but even if that happens, the legacy Satoshi created is indestructible even by him. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He realized that if he went public, he would be the target of many media attacks. Media is sometimes attacking Bitcoin but if they could they would find out every piece of detail in Satoshis life.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Satoshi being aware that this movement is bigger than one or a couple of people, Satoshi decided to remain anonymous, which is ingenious in itself.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitcoin is the definition of complete decentralization. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The HODL meter takes into consideration the current global monetary policy, the current market trend in different markets, macroeconomic situation worldwide, and consumer perception.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

You have two things: 1) actual Latin Americans saying “same bro” &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;and&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; 2) people from the USA/EU telling us we just don’t know about the actual place we live in. Astonishing&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/1t638a1qeqo81.jpg?width=1080&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=14251f74b2aab05532ad5525079a7cda9a5bacf7&quot;&amp;gt;Answer provided by government&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Moreover, if you are mining, you cannot treat the mining infrastructure investment as costs. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This nonsense is on top of a flat 30% capital gains taxes and 1% TDS. Moreover, as per the full laws, you cannot carry forward losses to another year as well. Now it seems even in the same year, you cannot adjust it with gains from another asset. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The government is on a path of de-facto killing crypto by over regulation. If you make the taxes so high and the compliance so expensive, no one will ever invest in crypto - that seems to be the thought process of this utter shit government. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
