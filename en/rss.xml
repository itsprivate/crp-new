I bought btc around 65k. It went up to 69k shortly after and we know the rest.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I heard the 100k by EOY and believed it. I didnt borrow money or invest anything I couldn&amp;amp;#39;t afford to lose, but I bought into it. I listened to too many people on twitter and YouTube yell &amp;amp;quot;TO THE MOOON&amp;amp;quot;. I get it. No one wants to hear realistic discussions. They only want to hear hopium.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But you have Saylor and Rao Paul, Plan B talking about BTC going to a million or 10 million. Then you have this demonization of selling. Paper hands bad. Diamond hands good. HODL HODL HODL!!!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You ever think the reason why is so they can buy and sell between 45k and 38k, make you hold so they can bounce the price up and down and get rich while we sit around and wait for them to let us make a little bread? Maybe they let us have 69k for a shot of hopium?? Idk man. It starts to shoot up and people fomo in so that rich dudes have someone to sell to.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They like crypto because of the low market cap and small supply when everyone holds. Low volume equals easy manipulation. They treat us like suckers...or maybe I just feel like one.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Am I overstating the obvious or completely wrong?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Don&amp;amp;#39;t know about you guys but I personally did not check my portfolio since November. Also my chart watching has drastically reduced. But now slowly getting back. The pain is there when crypto drops like 10%, then jumps 5% to put in hope but then drops 10% again.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Don&amp;amp;#39;t be afraid of that. Think of the day you will be there in the major bull market and tell all those newbies that you went through all that stuff.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Nell reports via Twitter that as many as 25 apps and services will be terminated on April 3. These include the following crypto projects: Yearn Finance (YFI), Keep3r (KP3R), Multichain (MULTI), Chainlist (CLIST), Solidly (SOLID) and Bribe.crv.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/9y8k59l60ul81.png?width=602&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=95eb11b9084970afae84486f8f4eb25ae1f75237&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/9y8k59l60ul81.png?width=602&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=95eb11b9084970afae84486f8f4eb25ae1f75237&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Unlike previous &amp;amp;quot;building in defi sucks&amp;amp;quot; rage quits, this is not a knee jerk reaction to the hate received from releasing a project, but a decision that has been coming for a while now. Thanks you to everyone that supported us over the past few years.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thus Knell. The authenticity of the message was initially doubted, as Cronje no longer has a Twitter account. However, journalist Colin Wu reports that Cronje confirmed the news via LinkedIn. The tantrums Knell refers to are familiar to Cronje. He has threatened to resign before when things went wrong with some of his DeFi projects. Cronje had in fact launched DeFi projects a few times with the warning that they were not yet finished. Despite this, people put a lot of money into them that was then stolen when vulnerabilities were exploited by hackers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Major damage Fantom and co the result?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yet the community cries that &amp;amp;quot;terminated&amp;amp;quot; may be a misleading term. After all, not all projects are being shut down.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To contain further damage, a number of projects have already announced that Cronje was not the only developer working on this crypto. The Fantom Foundation reports that more than 40 people are working on the Fantom platform. Also &amp;amp;#39;Banteg&amp;amp;#39; from Yearn Finance says that as many as 50 developers are active.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However, this may not be true for all projects. Some apps, such as Bribe.crv, now have a welcome message on the website stating that the service will be discontinued on April 3. Also, damage control seems to be working only slightly; the prices of many of these crypto received heavy blows this morning.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For example, YFI is down 11%, FTM 16%, KP3R 27%, MULTI 19%, CLIST 7%, and SOLID a whopping 70%. Solidly, by the way, launched less than a week ago. The hefty declines seem to be pulling even the rest of the market along.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And you kind of just stutter for a hot second as like a million thoughts flood your mind - history of money - gold standard - Brettonwoods - fiat - computers - hashes - housing crash - mtgox - DeFi - miners - inflation - consensus mechanisms - market caps - bonds - yield - Merkel trees - SHA-256 - Could probably talk for hours about economic possibilities.        &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here are the easy answers:&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
1). Bitcoin is just a money sending system, like the VISA network, but it’s now owned by anyone, it’s open source software. Really good for instant settlements, you can trade it back to USD in one click, while banks take a few days.       &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;2) Bitcoin is like a digital dollar, but instead of the US government making more of it whenever they want, it’s made on orderly computers by anyone who runs the Bitcoin software. The more computers the more strength the network has. It goes up in price because people find its digital value more and more worthwhile.           &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;3) Bitcoin is just digital money. Thing is it wasn’t once not digital and made digital like the dollar was, it was designed on computers using advanced security software with its continued computational integrity in mind.                       &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Those are my best quick answers. How would you elevator pitch Bitcoin?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

We are not bunch of evil money launderers. 
We are not Russian agents. 
And we sure are not here because we don&amp;amp;#39;t know the risks.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We are here because your system ruined our future. Because we don&amp;amp;#39;t see any other scenario when we can afford to buy a house or even a nice new car. People in 50s were compensated decently for their hard work. They had a roof over their heads, a nice job and a lots of hope for the future. We? If we are really smart we might pay off our debts by the time we have our first heart attack.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We are not victims of some crypto scam machine. We know what we signed up for. What you call it? Free market? Only this is truly a free market and not only in name for few to profit. We might actually have a chance of winning here. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Dear feds, every single person here knows this market is a minefield. They are not stupid. But what can you do when there is no safe option to reach your dreams? You take a risk. Yes, we are desperate and it is your doing. We are here risking for a win because we have no other choice. Because you fucked up bad.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Dear feds, there are more pressing matters than crypto, you fucked up earth and continue to do so. World is on the brink of war. We have tyrants taking out democracies and people&amp;amp;#39;s trust in you is at all time low. Leave us alone for once. Don&amp;amp;#39;t fuck this one up. We can take care of ourselves. It is our choice to make. Let us have this one thing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I imagine it can be pretty daunting and disconcerting with all the FUD, rug-pulls, scams, and pump-and-dumps. But, don&amp;amp;#39;t let that shit get to you, it&amp;amp;#39;s just part of the crypto journey, and every failure is a lesson, albeit a sometimes painful and expensive one. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The only thing you need to do is &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;comment your Banano address&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; and you will receive some.

Setting up a wallet only takes a minute or so and wont cost you anything.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;What is Banano?&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Banano is an instant, fee-less and eco-friendly cryptocurrency founded in 2018 and probably inhabits the most friendly and funny community in all of crypto. In fact, this endorsement (or just call it a kind note) should tell you all you need to know:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/fgjskua97sl81.png?width=751&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=33b9485b4db1ca575c8382dffb44ec8bc1a867df&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/banano/comments/n9oz27/creator_of_dogecoin_here_was_told_to_check_this/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Importantly, Banano has been distributed entirely for free since April 1, 2018.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Banano has ongoing development since years and has experimented with hundreds of different ways of distribution since then, while keeping the onboarding of noobs and the education of users as a &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;priority&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. For example, we set up &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://bananominer.com/&quot;&amp;gt;Bananominer.com&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; which simply means we are rewarding users to contribute to Folding@Home with BAN - while Banano itself doesn’t require mining. This incentive to support medical research has led Banano into the top folding teams of all time! Stats can be found &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://stats.foldingathome.org/team&quot;&amp;gt;here&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
Want more free Banano? Try out these &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/banano/comments/nyb4ch/faucet_list/&quot;&amp;gt;faucets&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and join our community (&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/banano/&quot;&amp;gt;Reddit&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.banano.cc/&quot;&amp;gt;Discord&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; being the most active channels), we have loads of different ways to get free BANANO all the time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also, in recent times we started to wrap Banano and bring wBAN to Binance Smart Chain, Polygon and since yesterday also to the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://fantom.banano.cc&quot;&amp;gt;Fantom network&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To better understand what Banano is, check out our &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://banano.cc&quot;&amp;gt;website&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;particularly our&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://banano.cc/yellowpaper&quot;&amp;gt;meme-rich Yellowpaper&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. For help getting started and relevant links check out &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://banano.how&quot;&amp;gt;banano.how&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;THANK YOU to &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/CC&quot;&amp;gt;r/CC&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; for letting us do this, and we&amp;amp;#39;ll see YOU in the Jungle!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I can report that, I do not yet own a private island or a yacht, but it was really fun building it and didn&amp;amp;#39;t make my daytrading any worse lol. I have open sourced the extension so you can play around with it yourself. Maybe it&amp;amp;#39;ll make you into a literal trading GOD - maybe it&amp;amp;#39;ll bankrupt you, who knows.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you want to run the extension you would need to go to &amp;amp;quot;Manage Extension&amp;amp;quot; and click &amp;amp;quot;Load Unpacked&amp;amp;quot; and then select the root folder of the Repo. Feel free to inspect the source code first, and if you like the idea, you can submit a PR and help develop it further.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To enable it, make sure you&amp;amp;#39;re on a Spot, Margin or Futures page, open the extension and click &amp;amp;quot;Enable&amp;amp;quot; - done.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/qehpe7w3qrl81.jpg?width=778&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=2c1df1d2d8f23830adebe5923315a9cfba96f638&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/qehpe7w3qrl81.jpg?width=778&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=2c1df1d2d8f23830adebe5923315a9cfba96f638&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On Spot and Margin (naturally) you need to pre-own the coin in order to sell it. But on Futures (which are derivatives)  you can place the opposite order on a contract meaning you don&amp;amp;#39;t have to pre-own the assets in order go short. Def not saying you should trade futures but that&amp;amp;#39;s where this extension works best.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;If you&amp;amp;#39;re curious about how it works, how I&amp;amp;#39;ve built it and my own results after a week of testing:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/3QAJWENW-20&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;https://youtu.be/3QAJWENW-20&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

They have been selling BILLIONS of coins over the past few months, straight onto the market. The coin has gone from $5 to 1.3c as is still continuing to drop 50% every week, this is dangerous as it is listed on a few big exchanges.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You want proof?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://etherscan.io/token/0x7420B4b9a0110cdC71fB720908340C03F9Bc03EC#balances&quot;&amp;gt;https://etherscan.io/token/0x7420B4b9a0110cdC71fB720908340C03F9Bc03EC#balances&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Take a look at the top wallet holders. A single Binance wallet has almost 4billion coins, that is supposedly 80% of the 4.7b total supply? How does that happen? I’ll tell you how, the circulating supply of 4.7b is a total lie! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you add up the holding wallets, it easily passes 20billion in circulating supply!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Want more proof?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://etherscan.io/token/0x7420B4b9a0110cdC71fB720908340C03F9Bc03EC?a=0x318f51f82d2f0f4ed9c51f53b4666bd1e260b3e1&quot;&amp;gt;https://etherscan.io/token/0x7420B4b9a0110cdC71fB720908340C03F9Bc03EC?a=0x318f51f82d2f0f4ed9c51f53b4666bd1e260b3e1&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is the latest of many wallets that are just constantly dumping in batches of 500m tokens. I have been tracking these wallets and they continue to release coins in batches of 500m into the market, maybe to cover their tracks?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Every few days 500m coins are dumped in the market. There are about 25 of these 500m wallets, only about 12 have been released, so they will be releasing another 6.5 Billion coins in the coming months or even weeks!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Want further proof? Have a look at their latest announcements. They are always riddled with spelling and graphical errors. The kicker? They couldn’t even spell their own product name correctly. I am not making this up, look at it yourself! And when you look into the content of their announcements? It’s all meaningless fluff that chucks in a few buzz words here and there, an absolute joke!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They recently hosted an AMA. Normally an AMA would be someone from the team. Instead it was an absolutely random person with a fake identity hosting it, the person doesn’t even exist! It was cut off early due to “technical difficulties”. I am assuming they realised too many people caught on.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is an obvious scam that needs to be delisted! Make this known to protect innocent people from losing their hard earned money! This price has dropped 99.5% and the scam community still tells people to buy into it! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;DO NOT BUY THIS COIN!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit - this has been cross posted on the JASMY reddit and they are downvoting this post! Don’t let them hide the truth.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit - Take directly from the JASMY website and translated.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“Precautions regarding solicitation regarding cryptographic assets (virtual currency), etc. from the Company or a person who claims to be an affiliated company of the Company&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Recently, we have been inquired that there is a person who sells crypto assets (virtual currency) by deceiving our name.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Although it has already been reported in the media, the Consumer Affairs Agency, Financial Services Agency, and Police Agency are calling attention to the increase in troubles related to so-called &amp;amp;quot;cryptocurrencies (virtual currency)&amp;amp;quot; that are traded electronically via the Internet.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We or our affiliated companies do not sell crypto assets (virtual currency). In addition, we do not make inquiries to customers. The seller of crypto assets (virtual currency) that masquerades as our company has nothing to do with us. Please be careful not to pay the purchase price or other money of crypto assets (virtual currency).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In addition, the seminars and information dissemination by Jasmy&amp;amp;#39;s official supporters and groups / associations that claim to be the community, and the act of selling cryptographic assets (virtual currency) have nothing to do with our company.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Since February 2020, the only one that we have officially operated or authorized to operate is the developer support IoT service co-creation community &amp;amp;quot;Jasmy League&amp;amp;quot; posted on our website. We monitor the activities of the informal community that has been officially recognized by Jasmy in a timely manner, and take appropriate measures for the detected items in accordance with our information agency.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Seems like the Rug pull is in its final stages, now they are claiming that there is no Jasmy token. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I tried my best to warn everyone.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So your precious interest rates have been Nerfed by the Man? Aww, Welcome to capitalism. There’s supply and there’s demand, there’s inflation and evolving financial regulations. Manage your expectations. A word of advice: don’t bemoan your hardship to someone more familiar with traditional finance. You will get laughed at. You will be told to take a nap. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto.com isn’t here to nurse your emotions. companies fail when they are unable to make hard decisions and evolve with the growing demands of the economy. Your disgruntled proclamations and threats of departure will not help anything. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;More importantly, the clamoring malcontents have profoundly missed the actual value and opportunity that CDC provides. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Just weeks ago, the entire crypto community was wokecasting how important it is to move away from Centralized Exchanges because of sanctions and frozen assets, Canadian and Russian tyranny, blah blah… well here’s the opportunity, and it’s called Cronos.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;VVS, MM Finance, Tectonic and beefy finance— these are noteworthy names in the DeFi LP/yield farming sector. Cronos dapps are gaining quick traction and the entire ecosystem is only 5 months old. Your precious 12% on stablecoins is laughable compared to the opportunities and financial freedom this environment offers and yet everyone is too busy Karening off at CDC to notice or care.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I’m not surprised at all that this news has become the latest claim to victimhood, that’s the only way people around here know how to get attention, thinking they’re all savvy and righteous.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Can we please for once take a moment to appreciate how Cronos is a hell of a lot easier and usually cheaper to use than your average DEX? It’s time to get the ball rolling people, put your money where your mouth is. I’m not going anywhere, my faith in the future of CRO and CDC is as strong as ever, and I strongly urge you all to re-examine your options. There’s a great case for optimism here, you only have to want to see it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I was so hopeful initially; I bought her two years ago and have been staking, which is great, but to see her price almost at where I bought it is very disappointing. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Every day I feel like I see bullish news about ADA: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For example, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;The total amount of ADA coins on 1-10 million sized wallets reached a record high of 12.47 billion.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;The total value locked on the Cardano blockchain hit a new all-time high (ATH) on March 4th and as it closes on $140 million.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But yet, the price doesn&amp;amp;#39;t move at all. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I know we&amp;amp;#39;re in a bear market, and nothing is doing well now, but ADA makes me the saddest. Although it is pretty cool that they did reach their goal of planting 1 million trees, at least there&amp;amp;#39;s that. It has a long road to recover its losses to get back to its ATH. Remember when predictions were at $10 by the end of 2021, lol. Funny. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What&amp;amp;#39;s your most disappointing holding?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: I have been buying all the way up, so my avg price is $.80. My third largest holding at this point.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I’ve been a huge advocate of CDC, but this change is going to make consider jumping ship. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They’ve just announced that from April, you’ll only get the full advertised rates on up to $30k After that with the rate drop and a x0.5 reduction, the 12% I was enjoying on TGBP/USDC will be cut to 5%&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Can anyone recommend a rival or alternative for TGBP that’s available to UK users?  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The sneaky part was, they advertised the change like the rates were going up.  “New tiered rates structure and higher rewards for select tokens”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;//edit 1: on further reading, there’s a chart within the link and it’s worse than I thought.  All stable coin rates are dropping by 2%. Flexible earn is dropping from 8% to 4% so if you have 30k then anything else in flex is 2%&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;//edit 2: I’ll add the recommendations below this post, my research into them and my finding later.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the meantime, thanks to &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/u/ashtonlaszlo&quot;&amp;gt;/u/ashtonlaszlo&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; who has put together a Google doc &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vpBQI2DFUk7zXS4TCs9ZOnatvWHiYf5jHjKgKpfJG5Y/htmlview&quot;&amp;gt;comparison doc&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; that shows the rates for ~200 different coins. And, that you can get 12.68% and 12.73% on USDT/USDC at Vauld and Hodlnaut, respectively.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
