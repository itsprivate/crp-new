&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I don&amp;amp;#39;t know if &amp;amp;quot;irony&amp;amp;quot; is the right word since it&amp;amp;#39;s not technically ironic, but there is something interesting about the fact that this was the perfect use of Bitcoin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m not sure if it&amp;amp;#39;s exchanges, how governments have regulated those exchanges, or something else are that changed things, but this &amp;amp;quot;store of value&amp;amp;quot; thing is not what was intended for Bitcoin. You may love the store of value angle or you may hate it, but either way: it&amp;amp;#39;s not what Bitcoin was intended to be.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Maybe it&amp;amp;#39;s a social engineered manipulation by big actors on that sub.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They are missing the big picture:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Why would I ever give up my Bitcoin for printed-to-infinity government coupons (IOU&amp;amp;#39;s)?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Neo: what are you trying to tell me, that I can trade my bitcoins for millions someday?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://gyazo.com/10ead3a5c1fd8ed1e9d150ed6cced62d&quot;&amp;gt;Morpheus: No, Neo. I&amp;amp;#39;m trying to tell you that, when you are ready, you won&amp;amp;#39;t have to&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;When measured in fiat, Bitcoin price will rise infinitely&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Bitcoin has no top, because fiat has no bottom&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I will NEVER sell my Bitcoin for printed-to-infinity government IOU&amp;amp;#39;s, the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-kKDR30Fb8&quot;&amp;gt;same as somebody who bought a block in Manhattan on the 1800&amp;amp;#39;s&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; will never sell it no matter how high the price goes when measured in ever-worth-less USD.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You earn in value appreciation/equity against USD as well as in the expensive rents your tenants are paying. If you need even more fiat you borrow against it, and pass the prime real estate to your children and grand children... for many generations, and they don&amp;amp;#39;t ever sell it for fiat either.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

If BTC hit 100k it would only closely match apple and still be nowhere close to gold&amp;amp;#39;s market cap. I still have money invested in the stock market because I believe in the future of US companies but even I think it&amp;amp;#39;s overvalued compared to what crypto could bring to financial networks.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And yes, apple is a big company that is also internal national but I still think the idea of crypto and the technology being developed by over 10,000+ developers  deserves a much higher valuation. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The negatives about crypto are what is highlighted like the exploitation of NFTs, scams, and pump and dumps.  Take a look at the bigger picture and you can see that nothing has changed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I have had an account at this bank for about 15-16 years, my parents opened an account where I couldn&amp;amp;#39;t touch the money until I am 18 years old. I am 28 now so I have been personally using this account for exactly 10 years.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I have been sports betting for 20 and playing poker for 15 years now. First through my father and his debit cards until I turned 18, and ever since then I have used my personal account to transfer money into various poker and sports betting sites.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For TEN YEARS these motherfuckers did not say a word and are still not saying anything about me losing maybe 5 figures on poker and football bets but now all of a sudden they are worried that I might lose a few hundred bucks at a volatile market. They were okay with me gambling when I was a barely legal teenager but God forbid I lose some money in the cryptomarket now that I am a grown man earning his own money.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Major investors like VC and private equity funds, put their money into projects with a roughly five year time horizon (when they have to pay back their investors.)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Literally billions of dollars have flowed into the crypto markets in January, 2022 alone. Temporary price movements have little to no effect on these investor decisions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As the old sports saying goes, hockey players skate to where the puck will be, not where it is now.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Other trends point in the same direction.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;More and more banks are going to offer crypto trading services (watch out for those fees) according to industry stalwart American Banker (&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.americanbanker.com/list/7-tech-trends-to-watch-in-2022-from-crypto-banking-to-biometrics&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.americanbanker.com/list/7-tech-trends-to-watch-in-2022-from-crypto-banking-to-biometrics&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;). &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They do this because they project continued demand for these services, which requires them to spend money on infrastructure, marketing, It teams, to make it happen. As slow as banks generally move, the fact they are offering these services is a longer-term plus.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Still not enough positive momentum?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Consider which Blockchain/web 3.0/tokenization projects are actually making services better, faster, or cheaper (or will relatively soon.) The tech adoption curve starts out slow, but eventually sweeps upwards over time (no one knows how long it will take until there&amp;amp;#39;s mass adoption.)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crashes like this shake out weak projects, get-rich-quick traders (they&amp;amp;#39;ll be back when green days return, no doubt), and other fad chasers. That doesn&amp;amp;#39;t change the longer-term trajectory of the industry.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

If you&amp;amp;#39;re freaking out because you YOLO&amp;amp;#39;d your savings into Dogelonmars42069, then yeah, you might have to learn a few hard lessons.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For the rest of you who have done their best to invest in more time proven projects like BTC/ETH its time to buckle up relax and wait for this all to blow over. Freaking out and panic selling to save a fraction of your investment wont help your future self. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Nobody knows anything. This might be a blip or a bear market. The best way to last in this space is to take a breather, zoom out, and realize eventually everything is gonna be alright. Success does not happen overnight.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;If you&amp;amp;#39;re freaking out now because you made some bad investments or over-extended yourself use this time as a learning opportunity.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I am not a crypto wizard. I made every mistake a newbie could make. Back in 2017-18 you could buy crypto with credit cards lol. But what I hope I&amp;amp;#39;m conveying is that if you hold onto your coins you&amp;amp;#39;ll most likely come out ahead eventually. In 2018 was so depressed and mad at myself I just uninstalled my apps and didnt look at my crypto until 2020. But then it got better and most of the projects I invested in back then started doing well again. If I had sold and not weathered the dip I would&amp;amp;#39;ve been even more angry at myself.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Remember to take time for yourself. Stop staring at reddit and charts all day. Please talk to someone if you&amp;amp;#39;re thinking about self-harm. It gets better yall. =)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the last 365 days Bitcoin is up 4.42% in that same span of time Amazon is down 15%&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/h4mqz840pnd81.png?width=790&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=cb6fc7911039289e88ae93d513d72cf199c562a7&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/h4mqz840pnd81.png?width=790&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=cb6fc7911039289e88ae93d513d72cf199c562a7&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But I know what you&amp;amp;#39;re all thinking 365 days is a long time. How can you possibly hodl an entire year?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/khkvtg7ypnd81.png?width=746&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=7122a5ef2330b0688c5619531d6b23c3c2f18660&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/khkvtg7ypnd81.png?width=746&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=7122a5ef2330b0688c5619531d6b23c3c2f18660&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Based on my extensive research it takes roughly 3-4 weeks to sail across the Atlantic ocean. If you have a boat and leave right away, you should be able to do 7 round trips.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now lets say you can&amp;amp;#39;t swim or you don&amp;amp;#39;t have a boat:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/ryt7yq3esnd81.png?width=746&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=7149169688ad7a3681611b88733003bcd670c15f&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/ryt7yq3esnd81.png?width=746&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=7149169688ad7a3681611b88733003bcd670c15f&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Since all you guys keep talking about going to the moon, just go!!!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In 365 days you could go back and forth to the moon almost 45 times&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;so if a Saturn V rocket cost $185 million X 45 trips that comes out to $8,325,000,000.00&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I’m not happy we’re going down but I’m also not shitting myself, just kind of whatever about it. If we go up from here, great 👍 I’ll sell some. If we go down from here, fuckit I’ll buy some.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I was in profit with a couple of coins and I was telling myself that I should get a few hundreds there, few from other coin  and just keep it in fiat or stablecoin or whatever, just save it for a dip or crash, nothing more, nothing less.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Of course, I always invested using DCA tactics and I will keep doing that, but I thought I should have a certain amount of money for a really big dip or crash and don&amp;amp;#39;t touch it untill it happens.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyway, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;don&amp;amp;#39;t be like me&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, keep some money in case of a drop, crash. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is the time when people are making money, investing and waiting for prices to climb up again.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I decided to try purchase my first NFT yesterday, and holy hell was that confusing. Still is. I used my MetaMask account had $200 worth of ETH on there, tried to bid on something worth .007 eth but noticed I had to change it? Okay did the steps ended up back with Poly??? Or some sort of “wrapped ETH”And now down to $70 due to gas fees.. worse yet I don’t even have the NFT. 
Just imagine going out to buy a $7 dollar beer only to be charged $130 then only to have the bar tender give it someone else. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I know there must have been steps I did not understand and may have screwed things up a little. But holy hell if we want this to be a thing of everyday use, this shit can’t be happening.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;EDIT- thank you everyone explaining things to me. Im not trying to shit on anything and I still have full belief in where we are heading. 
I understand now that we are still very early stages and I guess I’m just used to being late to parties. 
That and ETH is kind of a mess and there’s more than just OpenSea to purchase NFTs. Genuinely was unaware cardano has their own system for it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I mean what I’m about to say as genuine advice, not to make fun of anyone, but a lot of people here really need to take a step back and look at the bigger picture. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Every day we have people stressing and speculating over the day-to-day movements of their crypto, panicking over bear markets, asking “where should I invest this spare $50?!” in the daily. When in reality, they could see their portfolio do a 2x by working a few solid minimum wage shifts and dumping the paycheck into crypto. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A nice 20% pump on the $100 you invested in your favourite alt-coin which you spent hours researching, still only leaves you with $20 profit. You could probably ask your mom for $20 and she’d give it to you. It might be a harsh truth, but crypto isn’t a life-changing opportunity until you’re working with a decent stack of money, until then, conventional money-making methods are faster and more lucrative (without the potential downside of investing!)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It’s not what you want to hear, but a couple hundred dollars in the market isn’t going to make you financially free unless you’re the crypto-embracing, second coming of Warren Buffett. Grinding out a real life job and dumping that money into crypto? That might just do the trick though.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Important disclaimer/reminder:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; I mean ZERO hate to small time investors whatsoever with this post. You guys are learning essential lessons and gaining investing experience without the risk and potential downside of others with more skin in the game, and most importantly, small amounts of money can mean a hell of a lot more to some people than others. I’m simply saying look at the bigger picture, and make the most of your time. Crypto becomes more rewarding the more you can safely invest into it, typical jobs might not have the potential of crypto, but they will build you a base and give you a start way faster and safer.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I hear you are scared about that bear everyone is talking about. Will it wake up, will it get eaten by a bull? I don&amp;amp;#39;t know. But while we have nothing else to do, why not take the time to learn something new?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So let&amp;amp;#39;s talk about impermanent loss before nap time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Imagine I have a dragon, and I want to trade it for a unicorn. Both magical creatures are the same price (because they&amp;amp;#39;re magic).&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I go to the toys store, but they don&amp;amp;#39;t want to buy back my dragon. So I need to find someone who is willing to exchange their unicorn for my dragon. I go to the flea market, and I find a merchant with 50 dragons and 50 unicorns in his stand. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;This is the liquidity pool.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The merchant accept to give me a unicorn if I give him my dragon. But as the merchant has to make a living, he charges me a small fee, about 2.5% of the value of the trade, to accept my proposition. I gladly accept to pay the fee, and I go home with my new unicorn.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But now, the merchant has a problem : he has 51 dragons and 49 unicorns. If more and more kids want to trade their dragons for unicorns, the imbalance will grow, and the merchant will eventually run out of unicorns. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The merchant needs an equal amount of dragons and unicorns on it&amp;amp;#39;s stand to make good business.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; So he goes to a friend and offer to sell him 1 dragon for a discount - the dragon is worth $10, so the merchant will sell it for $9.95. The friend accept (because that&amp;amp;#39;s what friends are for), he turns around and sell the dragon at full price, netting a profit of $0.05. He then buys a unicorn on the internet for $10, then goes back to the merchant, and sell it to him for $10.05, netting another profit of $0.05 (this is called &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;arbitrage&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;). The friend has now made $0.10 of profits, the merchant has done $0.15 (the original 2.5% fee he charged me, minus the $0.10 loss from the trades with his friend.) Everybody is happy!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;That $0.10 loss is what is called impermanent loss. It&amp;amp;#39;s the cost of maintaining the balance between dragons and unicorns on the stand.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now, of course, if the merchant didn&amp;amp;#39;t charge me that 2.5% fee, he would be losing money. But he does charge a fee, so he ends up doing profits anyway. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So why are people afraid of impermanent loss? Because if the price of one of the item explodes, and the other item does not, then the losses will be greater. If unicorns are now worth $20, the merchant will incur a greater loss when his friend helps him with the arbitrage. It sucks, and that&amp;amp;#39;s why some people don&amp;amp;#39;t want to be liquidity providers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But here is the thing : &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;fees are almost always more then enough to cover for impermanent loss.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; In our example above, if the price of unicorn doubles and the price of dragons stay the same, impermanent loss will only amount to 5.72%. It doesn&amp;amp;#39;t take much volume for fees to cover this. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There are a few caveats, tho. If you want to provide liquidity for shitcoins, you will absolutely get rekt if/when the shitcoins value goes to zero. That&amp;amp;#39;s why you should provide liquidity only with tokens you are comfortable holding long-term. Another good thing to keep in mind is that it is way less risky to provide liquidity for a pair that includes a stablecoin, because it&amp;amp;#39;s value will go unchanged. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Some ETH/USDC pools were giving a whopping 200% APR for a few hours yesterday.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Even if ETH shot up to a ridiculous price tag of $50 000 USD in six months, you will have made more money then if you simply hold.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Another thing to keep in mind is that &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://dailydefi.org/tools/impermanent-loss-calculator/&quot;&amp;gt;impermanent loss calculators&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; give you the estimate difference between providing liquidity and hold-only... that is, if you were somehow able to perfectly time the bottom and top of the market. As we know it&amp;amp;#39;s impossible to time the market, those calculators really give you an absolute worst-case scenario.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Oh, darn, time flies! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s now nap time, my young friends. Hope you enjoy my story... and I hope you will dream of dragons and unicorns.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fuck no. (maybe) &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A dead cat bounce is a temporary, short-lived recovery of asset prices from a prolonged decline or a bear market that is followed by the continuation of the downtrend. Frequently, downtrends are interrupted by brief periods of recovery—or small rallies—during which prices temporarily rise.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Check the chart for March 18th, 2020. You can see a dead cat bounce a few days prior to a real crash that we know of.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So my  financial is advice (not a financial advice) is DCA slowly or wait a day or two to see the true heading of this run.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yeah it&amp;amp;#39;s cool to get the gains but the word about us being early just isn&amp;amp;#39;t true for most of the casual investors&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: I&amp;amp;#39;m not saying it&amp;amp;#39;s impossible to make money from investing in btc we all know it&amp;amp;#39;s gonna go up I&amp;amp;#39;m just saying we have to be honest with ourselves about the amount of gains we will make&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It’s when everyone is sure it’s going to go up (cough cough 100k by December) is when I am the most fearful!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Swim against the current my little fish ;) &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyway happy HOLDing/DCAing&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;MY OPINION: we are in a LONG term bull market with short bear moments.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;64k in may. The low was 29k &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Higher high 69k &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Higher low… 34k?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I hate to break it to you, but none of that matters. Have a look at this:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/y9221orvlhd81.jpg?width=2786&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e6877e80aa8975d8c8aa86f82c5f9972fc6222dc&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/y9221orvlhd81.jpg?width=2786&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e6877e80aa8975d8c8aa86f82c5f9972fc6222dc&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;EDIT: The chart cuts off at 2016...which is apparently making some people think there was a bear market sometime after 2016. Let&amp;amp;#39;s have a look:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/0us34zsk3jd81.png?width=2108&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=79de6ff34018315c748a2e743caef0ca3b277c65&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/0us34zsk3jd81.png?width=2108&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=79de6ff34018315c748a2e743caef0ca3b277c65&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;There was no bear market. There was a relatively small crash in 2020 as everyone panicked over Covid. That&amp;amp;#39;s not a bear market. This picture also shows you that it&amp;amp;#39;s even worse, the market has been absolutely parabolic for almost 2 years.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That&amp;amp;#39;s the S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 index. Notice something? Every ten years or so there&amp;amp;#39;s a severe downward correction which lasts 1-2 years. In the early 2000s it was the tech bubble, in 2008/9 it was the mortgage crisis. As you can see here, we&amp;amp;#39;ve been in a sharp uptrend for over 10 years now. This uptrend has been fueled not in small part by record low interest rates. This is turn has resulted in parts of the market being hopelessly overvalued, a prime example being Tesla.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now look at the crypto charts, specifically the top 50 alts. Most of them have had absolutely face melting pumps over the last 18 months. Do you think that&amp;amp;#39;s just going to keep going up? Their valuations are now so ridiculous that &amp;amp;#39;crypto market caps&amp;amp;#39; are basically a meme, completely detached from reality. Of course market caps are hardly ever a true reflection of what company is worth, but they are a reflection of the amount of speculation in the current market. Just to look at a few:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cardano MC $36 billion, doesn&amp;amp;#39;t have fully functional smart contracts, lots of promises while continually underdelivering, if at all.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Solana: MC $30 billion, has been unusable for the last 48 hours, has suffered multiple outages over the last 6 months which lasted up to 17 hours.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Dogecoin: $18 billion MC....don&amp;amp;#39;t think I need to go into more detail on this one.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Ethereum: $288 billion market cap, supposed to disrupt the global banking industry (along with everything else), meanwhile it costs $200 for a simple ERC20 token swap.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;BTC: $665 billion market cap, supposed to be the future of digital store of value, meanwhile, has lost more than 50% in value over the course of 2.5 months.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;etc....&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The point is that these market caps aren&amp;amp;#39;t a reflection of the current states of those projects, but rather their promised states at some future point in time. Unless that point in time is very close as in a few months away, that&amp;amp;#39;s not sustainable. I personally don&amp;amp;#39;t think that point in time is very close, as almost nothing in crypto currency works as advertised.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;What would a multi year global bear market mean for crypto?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- BTC bleeds more than stock market&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- ETH bleeds more than BTC&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- Alts will bleed even heavier than ETH and a good number will never recover. You have to remember something very basic here: if an alt your holding loses 90% of its value in the bear market, it has to pull a 10X just to get back to its previous price.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Further complication:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;DCAing into projects is obviously the way to go in a bear market, but it becomes more difficult to predict what projects will have merit the longer the bear market continues. Will your favourite project still be relevant in 2024 or will it be replaced by something that hasn&amp;amp;#39;t even launched and won&amp;amp;#39;t until 2023? The longer the bear market lasts, the more likely that outcome becomes. Do lots of research, try to keep up with the tech developments in crypto. The next Solana or Luna is probably being planned as I write this. Try to find it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;People predict another crash in March 2022 because of the increasing interest rates. Let&amp;amp;#39;s see how it works out, usually the opposite happens what this sub thinks. Just my 2 cents.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
