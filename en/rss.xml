This resulted in their project&amp;amp;#39;s hype almost dying just before the release of their NFT project (It later got removed from Open Sea). Yet after a few hours of release they still made about 7 million dollars. How does a project associated with NFT scam make 7 million dollars?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Looking close at those 7 million dollars. A lot of the buyers were brand new . I mean, there were so many that had never done anything on ether scan before. A series of shadow wallets all created by one person that was all buying tons of Squiggles. Millions of dollars worth of fake volume and then immediately flipping them on open sea for less money.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/aj4gj6wqhui81.png?width=1920&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=9d8bd44803349f78092840e79a7068f15225c8fe&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/aj4gj6wqhui81.png?width=1920&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=9d8bd44803349f78092840e79a7068f15225c8fe&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/t29cy81shui81.png?width=1920&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=9360c5cbf28912b9d0d826a9f2407648e0b429a4&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/t29cy81shui81.png?width=1920&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=9360c5cbf28912b9d0d826a9f2407648e0b429a4&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A single account, that spent 800 Ethereum, which is over 2 million dollars spread across two transactions, that created hundreds of new wallets .Each of these shadow wallets, then bought three squiggles a piece and immediately listed them on open sea for less money.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You might be wondering why do this? Why buy two million dollars worth of squiggles only to sell them for less? Well, the only reason that makes sense to me is they were trying to give the illusion of huge interest to get people to buy in to make people think this had a lot of trading volume , a lot of hype. The only people who could possibly want to do that is of course the team behind squiggles.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The reason for congestion?  A game with crabs called Crabada. Yes, I&amp;amp;#39;m serious. It&amp;amp;#39;s sunflower fiasco all over again just this time it&amp;amp;#39;s crabs instead of flowers. And this time too, it&amp;amp;#39;s the network that is supposed to bring us extremely low fees and speedy transactions. I&amp;amp;#39;m investment in AVAX but stuff like this really maks me wonder sometimes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

But do you believe that bitcoin will reach 1 million in 10 years time given all the slow adoption of BTC in every company. Fidelity, Cathy woods and prominent billionaires like Michael saylors thinks and believe that BTC will reach around that price target. Fidelity, BlackRock, and greayscale our some of the big institutions accumulating BTC on the sideline and giving way to major adoptions to conservative investors and curious investors who wants to dip in digital assets.  Given that big institutions are entering the market are you seeing the bright future of BTC along the way.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So do you buy whatever the price it? Do you accumulate continuously no matter what the price action it? Do you HODL and do you believe that we will reach this kind of market outlooks.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We’ve already calculated everything - the energy costs in the area we’re purchasing in and how much profit we’d make as well. We wouldn’t be living luxuriously, especially with two young children, but it would be enough to pay the bills and my husband to not need to work anymore.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I’m nervous about this new adventure, but also excited.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you have any helpful and kind advice, I’d greatly appreciate it :)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I am not from the US, so not an expert on all of this, but quick summary what happened:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Last October, it became public, that some Fed officials had &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/17/after-years-of-being-squeaky-clean-the-federal-reserve-is-surrounded-by-controversy.html&quot;&amp;gt;been trading stocks and bonds that could be influenced at least indirectly by their decisions&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. And, weirdly enough, it seems this wasn&amp;amp;#39;t against any rules - and to be fair, this doesn&amp;amp;#39;t necessarily need to be shady in any way, but it&amp;amp;#39;s a really bad look. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/27/dallas-fed-president-kaplan-to-retire-early-on-oct-8-citing-trading-disclosure-distraction.html&quot;&amp;gt;Some people had to leave their positions&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, even though nothing illegal happened, this was a pretty bad look.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Okay, so now they &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/18/fed-approves-rules-banning-its-officials-from-trading-stocks-bonds-and-also-cryptocurrencies.html&quot;&amp;gt;approved rules banning their officials from doing that&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. This is very reasonable. Should it have been done earlier? But, considering things happened already, is there anything better they could have done? I mean... not really? They reacted appropriately. There were no rules, this was bad, now there are rules. No reason to praise them for it, but they did the correct thing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So what does this sub do? You can guess it, &amp;amp;quot;government bad&amp;amp;quot;. Read the replies in &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/swam4i/according_to_a_decision_by_federal_open_market/&quot;&amp;gt;this post&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, or the ones in his even worse post titled &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/swcozf/feds_get_caught_insider_trading_government_says/&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Feds get caught insider trading, government says OOPSIE&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. Let me quote a few: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;This is just stupid&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;This will just make shit worse&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Oh so now they want to prohibit it after all the years they made millions upon millions of dollars.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;In completely unrelated news the average net worth of thr spouses of these employees has gone up 500%&amp;amp;quot; (yes, of course this is prohibited now as well, as you would know if you would actually read any article)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Fuck the government and the feds. They only do shit that benefits themselves.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;They&amp;amp;#39;re all fucking crooks&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Rules are beneath us. - Governments, prolly.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;People, what do you want? This is an example of a government body seing a bad situation and actually improving it. I am not a fan of the US government, but in this case, what tf do you want? Do you not understand the situation at all, or is the only situation you would say something positive about the government if they said &amp;amp;quot;we give everyone 10 BTC!!!&amp;amp;quot;?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Ugh. Sorry for the rant, but this is really ridiculous.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

All physical copies of the seed phrase are destroyed. This money is now mine and no one else&amp;amp;#39;s. I could be stripped of all my possessions, thrown in jail, declared an enemy of the state etc... but as long as I still remember that seed phrase the money is MINE. If that&amp;amp;#39;s not the coolest way to store value in history I don&amp;amp;#39;t know what is. Its like magic.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If anyone is wondering how I did this, I used a memory castle. This is a great thing to learn and not that hard. The core principle is to attach whatever you want to memorize to something in your long term memory. I just used my childhood home growing up. I take each seed word, and create a silly image of that thing in relation to some part of the home I grew up in. Then I can just imagine myself moving around my childhood home, and I see each of the seed words in relation to something I could never forget (The table my parents did taxes on, the entryway to the kitchen, the fireplace I sat next to in the wintertime etc etc.).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cryptocurrency isn&amp;amp;#39;t just a way to get rich. Its an incredibly powerful new technology. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Not wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t have affected just Coinbase. Many DeFi projects also use Coinbase as a price oracle... so something like this happening could have triggered an extinction event to all crypto markets, possibly liquidating tens of billions, maybe a hundred billion dollars.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Mr. White hat wasn&amp;amp;#39;t joking when he said this was potentiallytially market nuking.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Coinbase being Coinbase, deemed fit to reward our hacker with $250k, and there wasn&amp;amp;#39;t even any epic item to go with it. 3/10 would not do this quest again lmao.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This also shows a classic human behavior. You&amp;amp;#39;d skim on $50 worth of protection all the time but when you suddenly smash your head on the pavement and be bed ridden for the rest of your life you&amp;amp;#39;re gonna wish you didn&amp;amp;#39;t forget your protective gear. But of course you only appreciate your protective gear when you&amp;amp;#39;re bed ridden. When nothing happens you think even $50 is too expensive, maybe you could haggle it down to $9.69.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;We do not hold any keys. Therefore, we cannot freeze our users&amp;amp;#39; assets. We cannot prevent them from being moved.

It was designed to prevent large institutions from being “too big to fail” and being bailed out when economic hardships happen while the common people are left in the cold. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;not&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; meant to eschew laws or take down tyrannical governments. Honestly, having an immutable ledger of where you stole something and sent it to is probably poor form anyways.  It was never intended to be a political revolution either. It was trying to be free of inflation and corruption by a single or a few entities who could determine if transactions are approved with ulterior motives. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For all the people who think crypto entitles you to fund criminals or be criminals yourselves, why? What makes you feel so entitled to these feelings? Have you created your own cryptocurrency?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: didn’t know this was gonna be so controversial. If you wanna do illegal shit with crypto that’s cool, but you also have to be aware that what you’re doing is still illegal and you’re subject to penalty if caught.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/cdr62ff7jqi81.png?width=960&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=f5752413a7cf7e6d0ddfa796b830cfd24f0baa18&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/cdr62ff7jqi81.png?width=960&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=f5752413a7cf7e6d0ddfa796b830cfd24f0baa18&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He&amp;amp;#39;s a legendary investor at Wall Street.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
This man was named the head of the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Magellan Fund&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; at 1977 when he was 33 years old, which had $18 million in assets. He ran it for 13 yearsm, which allowed him to retire at 1990 at the age of 46, when the fund had grown to over $14 &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;billion&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; in assets. The fund annualized return was at  29.2%, more than twice the S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 at that time - which means that he &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;consistently beat&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; the market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After his retirement, this legendary investor switched to philantropy and only managed his own stocks.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So, I&amp;amp;#39;m reading Peter Lynch&amp;amp;#39;s book called &amp;amp;quot;Beating The Street&amp;amp;quot;, where he talks about his investiments strategies, the way he thought during critical momments and the market and so on. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While I was reading, I&amp;amp;#39;ve found this:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/erv8jkzwkqi81.png?width=799&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=fe3ddb1735f46a2236537cf890307cc8b11e9053&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/erv8jkzwkqi81.png?width=799&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=fe3ddb1735f46a2236537cf890307cc8b11e9053&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And then he proceed to argument that in many times that apparently the world would end, the market had some big crashes and then recovered and everyone was fine. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This made me think about the whole situation we are now. I mean, there&amp;amp;#39;s Putin going berserker at Ukraine, Biden saying that Putin certainly will attack it, interest rates going up, COVID has a new variant, truckers at Canada and Trudeau being mad...... basically, we are all gonna die.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Or maybe we are not gonna die and we&amp;amp;#39;ll be fine. We might even be missing some buying opportunities. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To finalize this post, I&amp;amp;#39;d like to quote Peter Lynch again:  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/c7eolmbllqi81.png?width=850&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=585f1db16cf74e02ca9da7ae632be98866d0322e&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/c7eolmbllqi81.png?width=850&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=585f1db16cf74e02ca9da7ae632be98866d0322e&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We will all be fine. Just turn off the TVs and analyze this situation clearly.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Wish you all best and sorry for any english mistakes, its not my first language.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Punk 6529 made a post on twitter that got 20,000 upvotes about why the precedent Trudeau is setting is completely dangerous and unsustainable, and he did it without being bias towards the truckers. I deeply underestimated how progressive crypto reddit is. The core developers, core exchange CEO, and entire fintwitter and crypto twitter are drastically more conservative and libertarian than this, and virtually all of the infrastructure they have built is to attempt to slow down the government, any government for that matter from behaving the way in which Trudeau is now doing, &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;yet here I see 600 comments on a thread with 1200 upvotes by someone going &amp;amp;quot;Hey maybe Banks having this power is a bad idea&amp;amp;quot; -- 600 comments defending KYC, defending CeFi, defending Pfizer, defending Ciphertrace &amp;amp;amp; Chainanalysis &amp;amp;amp; Elliptic, and defending Banks engaging in this behavior, and your willingness to trust the administrative state to not backdoor your crypto without due process, despite you literally defending the abrogation of due process. It makes me sick to my stomach. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The intention of crypto was Monero, and specifically the separation of state and money, not to recreate Web 2 on chain, with thought crimes and Black Mirror surveillance like China, on chain, not for your stupid pumpanomics, not for your willingness to comply with these insanely censorious regulations that merely recreate the entire SWIFT system and US Sanctions Regime onchain, which they by the way use to do extremely imperialist, racist things on the regular. You people are utter fools.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I’m not sure what they mean by “exclusively curated NFT” launches (on what basis is it curated?) but given that other platforms have everyone and their mothers launching NFTs, I’m up for something that is a little more handpicked. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Part of this package is the SMAK governance token which could go shoot up if the launchpad does well. I’m getting some just in case, because screw it, I’ve missed out on too much&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On a side note, I’m also growing open to the fact that newer NFT platforms might do better. Don’t get me wrong, OpenSea and the rest will still have a strong market presence but I think we’ll see some outflow as newer gen launchpads come up with better features and checks, kinda like how solana, fantom, bsc took some influence away from ethereum.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The DCA part does the job of taking out the emotions, and the “buy the dip” is to utilize the time to make your cost basis even lower (DCA down). In a time like this, it’s the worst idea to sell low. If you want to sell and take profits, you would have been doing it way back in Nov or early Dec last year. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now if you are not selling low, you’re halfway to success. You don’t want to do this:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/5yebj72b1oi81.jpg?width=934&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=53e793bd4abe054a1dbb1166c5e6ab12ada1c751&quot;&amp;gt;Please don&amp;amp;#39;t do this! &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But anyway, today I’d like to talk about &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;HOW&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;to buy the dip&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, because I have heard of it so many times here, but no one says how to do.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;The two types of mistakes in a downturn&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Panic buying and run out of fiat too early:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Let’s say you have always wanted to buy more of something but can’t wait, so you go all in the first dip. As usual, the dip will dip lower. You realize you have run out of fiat and hate yourself for missing out lower dips.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The overly pessimistic:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; You listen to a bear on the daily and they said (like in July 2021) BTC is going to $16k or even $12k! You keep waiting in Aug, Sep and realize the market trend has reversed! BTC was going up again. You have missed the chance!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Ideally, you don&amp;amp;#39;t want to be either of these types. It&amp;amp;#39;s impossible to catch the exact bottom, but even getting 10% close to it as a &amp;amp;quot;buy the dip&amp;amp;quot; purchase would be great!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Look at the big picture&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/qoha2can1oi81.png?width=1916&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=bf193efd3a253cb01d1c49b6422eb22d70fe7b05&quot;&amp;gt;Market entry cost basis broken by band. Full credit to @ TheRealPlanC on Twitter.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As you can see, there are various strong holders with cost basis between $36,380 to $41,872. Failing that, a relatively weaker one of $35,008, then a series of between $32,262 to $33,635. If it goes sub $30,889 there is almost no bull defense until $26,770 – that’s why we frequently hear “for the bear, it will have to trigger all the stop losses all the way down to $27k”. Never say never, but BTC going down to $16k or $12k is quite remote, unless there is an extreme black swan event.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Contrary to the popular belief, it usually takes weeks or months to confirm trend reversal, not a couple of days. Why? Crypto is often regarded as “riskier” than other asset classes, thus in a downturn, it will usually be one of the first to be sold. Thus, on the way back to recovery, it will require tremendous volumes over some time to confirm the trend reversal.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The big picture includes the financial market outside of crypto. The most noticeable is S&amp;amp;amp;P 500, NASDAQ and news about interest rate. And then we should not ignore the elephant in the room, such as Russia-Ukraine.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;How low the dip will go? – market indicators&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After we know that the market conditions would translate for (at least) several weeks in the “underwater” mode, it’s time to find the support bands. That would be one of the bases for setting price that trigger the dip buying orders.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Find the support bands:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; If you go to Tradingview and select the daily candle for BTCUSD pair, you will find some areas acting as support bands – kind of like a floor that prevents the price being dragged down further. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/dhh7bq5k2oi81.png?width=1449&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=dbaabf9944f1bb0cffaab9e96750d95ac60958a8&quot;&amp;gt;Tradingview - BTCUSD pair&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you’re not familiar though, several people can tell you the support bands. For example, Ben Cowen recently uploaded a video for the bear case. Sally Ho from Crypto Daily identifies the following downside objectives: $39,927 =&amp;amp;gt; $39,394 =&amp;amp;gt; $38,527 =&amp;amp;gt; $38,316 =&amp;amp;gt; $37,869 =&amp;amp;gt; $35,982 and $35,698 areas. Just now we are testing $39,927!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Relative Strength Index (RSI):&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;  Usually if RSI is less than 30, it’s a better time to buy. The lower it is, the larger amount I will buy accordingly.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/lnprbq5g3oi81.png?width=1888&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=7608e88045bc7b5edac9fef309a48a6bdd0f806f&quot;&amp;gt;The most recent time when RSI for BTC fell under 30 is 24 Jan 2022. That&amp;amp;#39;s a local low of $33,556. This is from Coindesk.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There is a website that tracks RSI instantly as well as many other market indicators in which you can track on Investing.com =&amp;amp;gt; indices =&amp;amp;gt; Bitcoin Real Time Technical.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/djwimigv3oi81.png?width=823&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=29774b616e7ccbe78c4c7c81e6dfd5aad766308d&quot;&amp;gt;Investing BTC indicators - you can see RSI is 34.061 now.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Whale watching:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;  When you start seeing the whales have started buying, it is also something worth considering. One of my most recent watch is the third largest address. Of course, this is just relative though. Whales make mistakes too, so don&amp;amp;#39;t take it as 100% signal. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/sxqq6wf64oi81.png?width=1920&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=f7c5bf719a6feb4da193a040eb4d37dc18fd4e13&quot;&amp;gt;Bitinfocharts - the third largest whale. As you can see here, this whale last buy is 274 BTC @ $37,260 on 04 Feb 2022. It has stayed on the sideline in the last 2 weeks.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Action: Set reducing buy orders, don’t go all in the first dip&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After having an idea about the scope of the dip, it’s time to put into action. The lower the price, the bigger the order. For example, if I use the support bands above.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/1r3u2fhk4oi81.png?width=278&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=ddcebcf6d619352eeed5aec83e7dec6b5271ebcf&quot;&amp;gt;Just an example. Again, this is up to your risk averse level. You may say, well my cost basis is $38k so I won’t start buying again until it hits $37,800. But this way you can make sure you still have fiat to buy if the dip goes lower. Never go all in the first dip.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;And of course, this is not financial advice, but that’s my strategy, along side dynamic DCA. What is yours? I would like to hear please.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And never sell during a dip, pumps are the time to sell, dips aren’t.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I’ll 100% take BTC to go down 50% more but then go up to $200k in about a year. In the meantime I’ll keep buying and increasing my bag.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Storing a password well or taking much better care of your financial belongings and the access to them is a necessary sacrifice to avoid centralized governance over your assets.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m glad this year DeFi is back on the rise and a lot of protocols are investing millions into the platform and trying to make it a better place like Bitdao, it creates more hope for more decentralization in the future because everyday shows that DeFi is needed or these unruly displays of government power will continue to happen.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

For that reason, it received negative karma, with the first comments being stuff like &amp;amp;quot;Typical crap to come out of the guardian&amp;amp;quot; and just &amp;amp;quot;Ffs&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Results of correlation for the entire range&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/kskr569b8gi81.png?width=664&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=fd4d6b30a3b57c2e5cf9644c20968c5e42abdff9&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/kskr569b8gi81.png?width=664&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=fd4d6b30a3b57c2e5cf9644c20968c5e42abdff9&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;each cells contains a correlation coefficient of the comparisons. A perfect  correlation is 1, 0 is no correlation and -1 is anticorrelated, meaning if 1 goes up the other goes down.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;we see that S&amp;amp;amp;P correlates very well with Nasdaq, at .9 which is almost perfect.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;S&amp;amp;amp;P is anticorrelated with the fear index aka VIX and does not correlate with gold. Making gold a good hedge.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;However for the entire range, S&amp;amp;amp;P only has a correlation of .23 with BTC.  This is statistically significant &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;but weaker than I would expect  so I dug a little further and ran correlation for each year&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/coqcah739gi81.png?width=129&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=86e936c0d0cf346723b98e7b1ebbbc4ef3969db5&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/coqcah739gi81.png?width=129&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=86e936c0d0cf346723b98e7b1ebbbc4ef3969db5&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So as you can see the the correlation seems to be going up starting in 2020. There used to be no correlation but something happened around this time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Next I ran a correlation month by month to detect any trends.  And it was again surprising that the each month the correlation changes so drastically, with some months even in in the anti correlated portion, meaning BTC is moving in the opposite direction.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/m2scttpe9gi81.png?width=1456&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=7b14df097fab38a977248030a8588d1acc0d7569&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/m2scttpe9gi81.png?width=1456&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=7b14df097fab38a977248030a8588d1acc0d7569&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Vertical dotted grey lines demarks years. Color green is when correlation &amp;amp;gt; 0 and red &amp;amp;lt; 0.  The black horizontal lines is set to 0.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Summary&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The idea that BTC  has increase in correlation recently is only partially true as you can see even in 2017 there were months with high correlations. Thus the correlation between BTC and the market seem to change on a monthly basis.

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Although on a global trend, the correlation is menacingly getting higher.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;there were some months were BTC was actually anticorrelated - at this point then it would be a perfect hedge for the stock market. The lowest months were the following. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Note that its usually in the summer time&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/lajmfkh4agi81.png?width=253&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=a9946a9e27ea104823c2af5a3e53b425965c4295&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/lajmfkh4agi81.png?width=253&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=a9946a9e27ea104823c2af5a3e53b425965c4295&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here are the months with the highest correlations and interestingly this is usually in the winter time. hmmm. interesting.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/h49cetvmhgi81.png?width=239&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=063c5d8577b40f17e45876224e8609d6db9c7128&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/h49cetvmhgi81.png?width=239&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=063c5d8577b40f17e45876224e8609d6db9c7128&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TLDR: correlation of BTC with the market seem to change month by month and in some cases its even the opposite however year over year the correlation does seem to be going higher.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
