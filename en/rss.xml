I personally think we are close to the bottom, most people who still hold crypto right now probably do not have any intention of selling at the moment. That means we only go up from here, this might not happen anytime soon so accumulate as much as possible. Goodluck üëç&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The is huge as it signifies market sentiment has completely changed. The S&amp;amp;amp;P was up only 2.22% today on news of the fed hike, and since 4 is bigger than 2, I feel confident in saying we have officially decoupled from the stock market. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I know what you‚Äôre thinking- ‚Äú4% in a day isn‚Äôt that big of a change.‚Äù And yes, I agree with you, but let‚Äôs imagine the market grows 4% everyday for the next year. Because crypto is a 24/7 market, we get 2 days over the stock market. 4% of compounding interest over 365 means $100 investment today could turn into $164,880,329 a year from today. Now that‚Äôs wife-changing money!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Why do I think this? Well, the fed stated will continue to increase rates over the next year. From that, I can deduce the market will increase at the same rate over the next year. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I can‚Äôt believe yesterday my wife was telling I was an idiot for losing half of our child‚Äôs college money on ‚Äúmagic internet money.‚Äù After I tell her that I‚Äôve only lost 40% of the money, she‚Äôll really be eating crow. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you‚Äôre like me, you‚Äôll know the bull run is back on. Take out a second mortgage on your home. Get as many personal loans as you can. Max out your credit cards on crypto. Your future self will thank you. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Do not do any research. This is financial advice.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;According to data from CoinGecko, Bitcoin moved from $39K to $41K in around 2 hours on Wednesday, 16th March. However, it then dropped back down to $39K before climbing above $40K again.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitcoin has a 41% dominance of the cryptocurrency market, and as a result, its price movements almost always influence the broader market.¬†&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;SOL, ETH, and ADA spiked almost perfectly in line with BTC. All three altcoins saw an increase of around 5% before witnessing a similar decrease to BTC.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;BTC and the altcoins gave up some of their gains following the spike. However, they have all held a positive 24 hours trend with SOL moving up 5.2%, ETH 5.9%, and ADA is up 2.9%.¬†Sou&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Nevermind educating people enough so that they know what voltage their electrical sockets give. Half of them haven&amp;amp;#39;t even figured that one out yet, but instead their minds were replaced with some commie&amp;amp;#39;s thoughts onto a quick draft wiki page while boomers with PDST get reminded of &amp;amp;quot;Prisoners Of War&amp;amp;quot; everytime they hear POW. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Proof of this was the realization that 5 years ago, less than a million people signed a stand to denuclearize the world.   That will give you a clear picture about everyone&amp;amp;#39;s wokeness as a whole, and they are STILL TALKING about crypto.  They actually make a point to stop crypto transactions with Russia more than preventing a Nuclear war.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
.
Holy shit.   Indonesia&amp;amp;#39;s religious sector just said Crypto was against their religious beliefs as the reason to stop it.  But God ..don&amp;amp;#39;t stop the internet.  Nothing wrong with yanking it to P0rn0 right?   But bad ol crypto currency.      People actually think God said Yes to Internet but No to crypto. Like he&amp;amp;#39;s some sort of disgruntled politician upset that is Banking Investments are stagnant. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What a load of shit.   No wonder why bible stories say God will come back to destroy the Earth. We are too stupid for him, I&amp;amp;#39;d be pissed too if I were him.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here‚Äôs everything that has happened so far.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;March 3rd 2022&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They begin by changing the safemoon domain to .com address.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They also release a new video &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3OJimdqDd0&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3OJimdqDd0&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; showing new logos, wallpapers and concept art they created. According to the video, &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;the shapes and colors capture and display the soul of Safemoon and the SafemoonArmy&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;. People are impressed, they believe they put a lot of effort to create these and it‚Äôs probably the first original thing they created.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A few hours later, some reddit users find the logos for sale online: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://chromasupply.com/collections/all/products/nexus-swirling-abstract-shapes&quot;&amp;gt;https://chromasupply.com/collections/all/products/nexus-swirling-abstract-shapes&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.istockphoto.com/photo/abstract-3d-rendering-of-a-twisted-shape-gm1091231170-292736186&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.istockphoto.com/photo/abstract-3d-rendering-of-a-twisted-shape-gm1091231170-292736186&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Seems like 90% of the logos were stock images and renders that were recolored. This is the Safemoon way.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;March 4th 2022&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They announce an agreement with Moonpay, the service they use to buy BNB to exchange for Safemoon for 0% fees on purchase starting from the 5th of March for 14 days.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;March 5th 2022&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;New Safemoon wallet update!!!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Many people still complain the built in calculator crashes the app.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;March 6th 2022&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They announce that safemoonswap will support cross chain swaps beginning March 23rd. We shall see how this goes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;March 7th 2022&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A new token listing, Reflex token. Another in a series of dodgy, cringe tokens that promise the world but deliver nothing. As I say in a past post, &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;every shitcoin in its death throes that wants a final pump before completely vanishing from existence goes to Safemoon and asks for a partnership.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; If you check all the tokens they have listed in the past month, you can see the classic pump and dump pattern. I am sure some people make a lot of money each time a new token is listed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: Every token that wants to get listed on Safemoonswap has to pay ~$100k to Safemoon. The token creators use the army to pump and dump and the Safemoon teams gets a nice bonus. Everyone wins. Except the army as always.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;March 8th 2022&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They announce that they are working on scripts to identify people who lost money migrating their tokens from v1 to v2 and refund them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For anyone who doesn‚Äôt know, Safemoon decided to migrate from v1 to v2 in order get listed on more exchanges as the main problem preventing them was that the price ‚Äúhad too many zeroes‚Äù as they said (bs). The 1000:1 migration was voluntary but then people started taking advantage of the price difference between v1 and v2 to make money.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In their infinite wisdom, the Safemoon team decided to implement a 100% tax on any v1 transactions and announce it only a couple hours before in order to force people to migrate. For weeks anyone who wasn‚Äôt actively following their twitter/discord/reddit lost all their money due to the tax. People got together, created a subreddit in order to discuss how to proceed and decided to do a lawsuit. If I remember correctly they gave them until the 9th of March to respond about what would happen to their lost money.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;March 9th 2022&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The brother of the CEO, Charles Karony announces that he leaves his position as Vice President of Safemoon in order to return to college and complete his degree.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That normally wouldn‚Äôt be a bad thing but if you look in the last year of Safemoon‚Äôs life, every single member who had any role in it has left and is currently living a life full of luxury and travels, something weird as some of them before were no name twitch streamers with 0 viewers and small unknown DJs. Something certainly smells here‚Ä¶&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;March 10th 2022&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Safemoon CEO John Karony wins Utah‚Äôs 2022 CEO of the year. Every single nominee in the list was also a sponsor of the awards.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;March 15th 2022&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;John Karony attend SXSW and gets interviewed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;March 16th 2022&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Huge whale sells adds a zero to the price. A giant red d**do on the charts screws up everyone. This is going well‚Ä¶.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A couple more things I saw today that have nothing to do with the birthday but everything with safemoon.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The treasury wallet of Safemoon, a wallet they use to fund their business expenses by siphoning a portion of the taxes after every transaction holds 31.099 billion safemoon worth almost 35 million dollars. The wallet is so big that it drains a big portion of the reflections meant to go to holders of the token. You can check it here &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://moonscan.net/sfm:bsc/0xdaa3b5ae0521264e55f45157eb6e158e1f3e5012&quot;&amp;gt;https://moonscan.net/sfm:bsc/0xdaa3b5ae0521264e55f45157eb6e158e1f3e5012&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The blockchain wizard Thomas ‚ÄúPapa‚Äù Smith that once said Ripple offered him $2 million dollars to work for them, a core member of the team that left a few months ago, now says that he was actually a contractor and we just assumed his role was to code. This guy is clearly high again.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/8nh0b4nbfsn81.jpg?width=640&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=b5f662093562b60bb8a876848decd2961ca02a45&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/8nh0b4nbfsn81.jpg?width=640&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=b5f662093562b60bb8a876848decd2961ca02a45&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A user on discord asks John Karony about the 2 blockchains he mentioned in a CNBC article. His response: ‚Äúwe built a blockchain or two to test things‚Äù. 20 days ago he mentioned that the actual coding hadn‚Äôt even started yet and that it is only 10% of the process, the other 90% is prep work. He clearly doesn‚Äôt know what he is doing.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Not only crime but people also worry about companies launching their own &amp;amp;quot;Amazon coin&amp;amp;quot; that you can only use on their platform.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You know what else is a shitty &amp;amp;#39;this company only&amp;amp;#39; method of payment? That&amp;amp;#39;s right, gift cards.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So why aren&amp;amp;#39;t governments trying to &amp;amp;quot;protect us&amp;amp;quot; from the evils of the Amazon $5 card? Why are they allowed to be sold everywhere? Surely they are the ultimate medium for cyber crime.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Oh because big companies pay the government a LOT of money and they want to sell their own consumer unethical &amp;amp;#39;not currency&amp;amp;#39; as crappy presents and reap in huge year on year gains!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Each new entry was a potential chance to get in on the ground level of some new venture into the unknown.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yet nowadays crypto looks like Netflix, for every actually well known, successful piece of media it&amp;amp;#39;s just pages and pages of &amp;amp;#39;originals&amp;amp;#39; to the point where the little notification that Netflix has released a new item fills me with the same level of excitement as the cooking instructions on my tin of soup.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Every new coin just seems to be either one of the following categories:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A rug pull or some other type of scam, often pumped by some influencer or celebrity that will be dead before it even hit the ground.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Promise the moon but will never go beyond initial development, often involving laser eyes with a price history that will resemble a playground slide as it creates a perfect first half of a parabola.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Some tokenomitry that is just pure maths cringe with about two dozen zeros to the right of the period before you hit an actual number and a supply that extends another couple of down zeros to the left.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Elon Dodge trash tier coin&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Personally, I&amp;amp;#39;m not even looking at anything that isn&amp;amp;#39;t in the top spots anymore, and almost half of those are rejects anyway. It&amp;amp;#39;s sad that the discovery phase of crypto is basically dead and it&amp;amp;#39;s now just stick to what exists and be a bag holder.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

It worked : I got hired for a start-up in December, and started to work for them in January. I resigned a few weeks ago, and now I want to share my (not so good) story with you.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;(I won&amp;amp;#39;t name the company in question, because I have signed a NDA. But rest assured : you never heard of it before, and it&amp;amp;#39;s not a major player in the ecosystem - it&amp;amp;#39;s not even a minor player.)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;First of all, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;the level of disorganisation and chaos was absolute madness&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. Each morning we had a different objective, based on the most recent trend in the market. NFTs are becoming popular? Let&amp;amp;#39;s do NFTs! This particular token is performing well? Let&amp;amp;#39;s buy it, even if it&amp;amp;#39;s at ATH! One of our product doesn&amp;amp;#39;t work anymore because we rushed a bug-fixing patch? Let&amp;amp;#39;s pretend that never happened and let&amp;amp;#39;s keep pushing rosy marketing articles!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I know that start-ups are notoriously disorganised. I get it. But you can&amp;amp;#39;t expect to be a profitable company, or even be a productive member of the crypto ecosystem, if you can&amp;amp;#39;t even define your objectives and stick to it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Secondly, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;we cheated.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; What I mean is that we bought bots for our TG channels, we faked users in our Discord, and we partenered with dubious &amp;amp;quot;influencers&amp;amp;quot; to make it look like our products were far more popular than they really were. This kind of stuff is what gives crypto it&amp;amp;#39;s bad reputation to the outside world, and I deeply regret having been a part of this for a short time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And finally, and I think this is the most important part : &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;the founders didn&amp;amp;#39;t care about the crypto ecosystem at all&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. Their main objective was making as much money as quickly as possible. We were acting like an evil hedge fund, precisely the type of institution crypto is supposed to fight. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I felt sad. I felt like a scammer. So I quitted. And, keeping in line with everything I wrote before, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;they didn&amp;amp;#39;t pay me for my last week of work&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. They just ghosted me.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So... yeah. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I don&amp;amp;#39;t want to discourage people from getting a job in crypto. I still believe in the future of this industry. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;But I would advise to stick with the well-known companies of our ecosystem&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, and not waste your time in little-known start-ups that have big dreams, but can&amp;amp;#39;t deliver. We have a long, very long way to go before we become a respectable industry.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Just one small reminder from the post I found on ethereum subreddit.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sending crypto can be scary sometimes. That is why, usually, a lot of us send a test transaction first to make sure everything is okay before sending a full ammount.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now some pros lost that fear with time, but here you can see &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;one of the biggest crypto masterminds&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Vitalik Buterin sending test transaction before sending a full ammount of ETH, just like us!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Well, this transaction also shows how ETH is actually decentralized because we can see network founder is testing transactions because even he knows that he won&amp;amp;#39;t take it back if he messes it up.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

And not this isn&amp;amp;#39;t an exact science since factors can change the numbers a bit, and before digging into this I&amp;amp;#39;m figuring you would already have to have a ton of money where you aren&amp;amp;#39;t worried about this anyways.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Note when I say passive income to live off of, I don&amp;amp;#39;t mean high income as a laundromat chain (which btw from what I hear is one of the best methods at passive income in a normal way). IMO livable wage would be about $35k a year. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;HNT mining:&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;HNT mining is a bit different from normal mining, but IMO it might be one of the easier methods since you&amp;amp;#39;re just setting up a radio system and not dealing with GPU and other things. But at the same time, this might not be possible depending on your location and ability. Like lets say if I own a ton of rentals, I would look at this. Depending on the distance you could setup a number of HNT miners, and make money.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now lets look at the numbers. Again, this depends on your location, equipment, and so on. But what some are reporting is about 0.2 HNT (roughly $4 right now) per day per miner.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Each miner is about $500&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So 4*365=$1,460 per year per miner. $35k/$1,460=23.9 miners 24*500= &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$12,000&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Again, this means you need to find a place to put 24 miners, get it all working, and so on. Just the location will rule out many.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Something to note, IMO I don&amp;amp;#39;t think this is a good long term option. I think like normal GPU miners this will dramatically decrease amount earn over time, and many are waiting a solid year before getting their miners after ordering them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;GPU mining:&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Like before, this highly depends on a number of factors. And note the $ is going to focus on the GPU cost and not motherboard, electric, and other factors.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;First off you can go to the following to pull up whatever numbers &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://whattomine.com/&quot;&amp;gt;https://whattomine.com/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m going to be using a 3090 GPU as an example here and we will be looking at current ETH.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/t5pl0bq0dcn81.png?width=1824&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=5235c551540645854b34ca9c24030bec10f73b59&quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Per 3090 you&amp;amp;#39;re looking at roughly $4.61 per day.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Price per 3090 right now it looks like it averages around $2,300 per.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;$4.61*365=$1,682.65 per year. $35k/$1,682.65=20.8 GPU. 21*$2,300= &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$48,300&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Something to note is I think POW is going out the door slowly. There most likely will always be some coin like RVN that allows for this. But there is obviously a strong push for POS because of the green stuff.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Another thing to note is it is likely GPU prices will dramatically drop in a few years. The biggest chip manufacture is moving to USA AZ to get away from China due to political reasons. They mention something like 2024 or 2025 before getting everything fully running and setup. But they are moving a lot faster than expected. Still, I expect by 2025 we will see a massive drop in price in chip prices.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Staking and DeFi/yield farming:&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So it appears POS is where things are going. You can get different rates. Most aim for around 9% at max because keep in mind staking rewards are inflating (lowering the value of the coin) since it is making new coins like mining does.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To get a good overview you can go to &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stakingrewards.com/calculator/usdt/&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.stakingrewards.com/calculator/usdt/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Oh and note when the coin goes up in price this can make it where you need less staked. But because math and I don&amp;amp;#39;t have a working crystal ball. I am just assuming the price is stable from here on out.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So lets say 9% staking rewards per year.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;$35k/0.09= &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$388,888.89&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. Meaning you need to stake $389k worth of coins.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Defi &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stakingrewards.com/defi/&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.stakingrewards.com/defi/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Defi the % you need to aim for the most as possible since you&amp;amp;#39;re not creating new coins which means you&amp;amp;#39;re not lowering the value by doing it. But just do the math and you can quickly figure it out. But lets just say you need an easy quarter of a million dollars staking or more.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Reflections:&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So with reflections this is extremely hard to figure out since unlike the others this highly depends on others. How reflections work is when people buy, sell, or transfer the given coin. Part of the transfer fee goes to everyone. So this means when someone does anything with the coin, then you get a little. The amount you get depends on the transaction fee size, the amount of coins out there, and how many coins you hold. So it is impossible to figure out prior.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;BUT in my experience it looks like you get around 2% per year. Note things like Safemoon and other things are looking at having reasons for using the coin. Like attaching it with a debt card or whatever. And when that happens that should in theory massively increase that % per year. But for the here and now, I would expect something like 2% a year.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;$35k/0.02= &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$1,750,000&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;IMO this will be more worth while years down the road if a coin with this gets more of a use to use it, and you aren&amp;amp;#39;t depending on just trading.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Bots:&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is a side thing and just in my experience. I was getting 5% ROI with grid bots. Something like 3commas is about $600 a year. And note you will have a metric ton of transactions so you need to look into if you need an accountant and the tax tracking software like Koinly. Like when I say a metric ton of transactions, we are talking about 40k transactions per month or more. And the aim of gains per sell is 10 cents.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;IMO I think your goal on this should be more $50k+ in returns per year since you will be spending a chunk of that in keeping yourself safe with the IRS&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;$50k/0.05= &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$1M&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So as you can tell, this is a rich person&amp;amp;#39;s game.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
