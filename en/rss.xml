I’m sure I could of timed it better. But my plan is to stake what’s available of these and cold storage the rest. The plan would be to revisit all these purchases between 2024-2026. If they’re still alive either hodl longer or take profits if they’ve made good gains. Some are good alts that I picked and some were just random purchases off Coinbase that I could get a lot of tokens/coins for a few dollars just for fun. I’ll break down my current portfolio below with the gamble portfolio as well.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How the $1000 was spent:
Avax 11%
Algo 9%
Polygon 9%
Enjin 9%
Cardano 9%
Gala 8%
Cosmos 7%
Chiliz 6%
Dot 5%
Tezos 5%
Doge 4%
Anchor 4%
Bat 2%
Fet 2%
Uni 1%
Lrc 1%
Spell 1%
Jasmy 1%
1inch 1%
Perp 1%
Wluna 1%
Loom 1%
Voyager 1%
Shping 1%&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Real portfolio:
BTC 52% ETH 32% Link 9% Sol 4% HNT 2% Amp 1% also have some random coinbase earn coins and like 120 CRO that was given. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Like I said my plan is to hodl and stake all these for the longterm hoping one of these random alts will pull the next Sol. Wanting that $1k spent to at least make itself back in the future (I know they could all go to $0). Let me know your thoughts on this strategy. I may add some more alts over time but in very small increments like $10-100 per purchase. Reason I picked most of these is cause of ease of purchase off CB I know of better alts on other exchanges didn’t want to go through hassle to buy them though. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Have you ever bought a random alt and forgot about it for years to come back and find it mooned?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I even bought a hardware wallet several years ago but was too nervous to actually transfer my coins to it. I figured a big company like Coinbase is probably better at security than I am, so what&amp;amp;#39;s the real risk? A post here last week was what finally pushed me over: pointing out that in bankruptcy, Coinbase could (and probably would) liquidate my coins to pay creditors. While I don&amp;amp;#39;t think it&amp;amp;#39;s likely that my Coinbase vault would get hacked, I do think there is a much bigger chance for Coinbase to do something dumb on the business side and go bankrupt during some particularly bad market volatility. So I bit the bullet and transferred my coins - other than the excruciating 30 seconds between initiating the send at waiting for it to show up on the other side it was very painless. TL;DR I finally pulled my coins off of Coinbase, and you should too&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This becomes even more suspicious as LFG and other operators are not releasing evidence of their transactions where they claim they sold coins to market makers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The initial research has been done by blockchain analysis software provider Elipsis, and shows the possible time of the trades and are documented here: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/elliptic/status/1525246959161905153&quot;&amp;gt;https://twitter.com/elliptic/status/1525246959161905153&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The LFG wallets were emptied on 9/10 May, as UST began to collapse - purportedly to to support the UST price&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However today, LFG revealed they sold their holdings as below:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/LFG_org/status/1526126708193054721&quot;&amp;gt;https://twitter.com/LFG_org/status/1526126708193054721&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Transferred 52,189 BTC to trade with a counterparty, net of an excess of 5,313 $BTC that they have returned, for an aggregate 1,515,689,462 UST&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This implies 52189 minus 5313 btc was sold for 1515689462 UST , i.e. the BTC price at the time of sale/loan was : $32334.01&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sold 33,206 BTC for an aggregate 1,164,018,521 UST&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/LFG_org/status/1526126713062576128&quot;&amp;gt;https://twitter.com/LFG_org/status/1526126713062576128&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This gives us a BTC price of $35054.46 per BTC at the time of this transaction!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;LFG apparently used the proceeds of the BTC sale to market buy UST on exchanges in an effort to support its peg. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you look at BTC charts, the price of BTC during 9th to 10th May was around $34200 to $29700 range. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This means those who were on the opposite side of LFG&amp;amp;#39;s BTC sale for UST buys (published by LFG themselves) seemed to have got a much higher conversion rate, than what the UST&amp;amp;#39;s crashing price reflected! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;According to the price of UST on Coinbase, we can see that on 9th, UST ranged from 99.6c to as low as 75c! And on 10th, UST opened at 93c and fell to as low as 62c! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Those who were on the other side of these initial trades were able to redeem their UST almost at a $1 peg, as LFG bought their coins. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Who were at the end of these trades, only LFG and other insiders seem to know. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This whole thing is murky af, and this kind of suspicions is enough to call for an audit of the entire transaction history by a reputed audit firm. Around $40 BN worth assets were burnt to the ground in this mess, it is not a small amount by any means. The Mcap destroyed in this is comparable to the mcap of Lehmann Brothers. Whats worse is that UST mcap was actually dollar denominated debt held by many retail users. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;LFG and all the operators/insiders involved should provide maximum transparency around these trades.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The remaining amounts to similar Market Makers and CEX associated entities &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Let us be clear Tether and by extension Deltec ( bank for Tether) and Ifinex&amp;amp;#39;s ( owners of Tether) customers arn&amp;amp;#39;t the average joe on the street. It&amp;amp;#39;s the CEX system! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Ifinex through their own exchange Bitfinex showed you could essentially pump liquidity into the market from thin air and benefit from the fees while inflating your valuation. By just &amp;amp;quot;lending&amp;amp;quot; out USDT to the CEX and leveraging to the  tits with the same USDT. Which based of the NY case documents was $600 million of the CEXs own money. They backed the USDT loan with the CEX&amp;amp;#39;s own funds! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So if we are talking about $8 billion being &amp;amp;quot;redeemed&amp;amp;quot; we have to assume it was one of these market makers and or CEXs. Which based on some loans that had USD intrest payments we can then get a clear picture of what&amp;amp;#39;s going on &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Tether gives a loan to a Market Maker of $2 billion USDT. The Market Maker pays the intrest on this loan in USD to DELTEC. This is the source of the 3 -5% cash deposits they hold. The Market Makers then transfer these &amp;amp;quot;loans&amp;amp;quot; to CEXs ( those $1 - $2 billion weekly FTX and Binance transfers we saw)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But you are probably asking where the $2 billion initially came from. Easy it is commercial paper and shares in the CEX that just got the Transfer. The CEX&amp;amp;#39;s value is inflated by the USDT injection that increases the value if its Balance sheet assets ( crypto/ shares) which means Tether has greater &amp;amp;quot;reserves&amp;amp;quot; so they can magically print more USDT &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So logically speaking due to the recent drop in prices and  based off Coinbase&amp;amp;#39;s valuation collapse. We can assume the Tether reserves are in the shit. So they can call in their loans. Which are paid in USDT not USD. Only intrest was in USD &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thus when they burn the loan there is no redemption! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There was never $8 billion&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Note: For legal reasons this is for purely educational purposes and if any  person privides proof of redemptions of the $8 billion. I will delete this post&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;· 39,914 $BNB&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;· 26,281,671 $USDT&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;· 1,691,261 $LUNA&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Consistent with its non-profit mission &amp;amp;amp; focus on the health of the Terra ecosystem, beginning on May 8, when the price of $UST began to drop substantially below one dollar, the Foundation began converting this reserve to $UST.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Foundation did so by directly executing on-chain swaps and transferring $BTC to a counterparty to enable them to enter trades with the Foundation in large size &amp;amp;amp; on short notice.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;LFG:
· Directly sold 26,281,671 $USDT &amp;amp;amp; 23,555,590 $USDC for an aggregate 50,200,071 $UST
· Transferred 52,189 $BTC to trade with a counterparty, net of an excess of 5,313 $BTC that they have returned, for an aggregate 1,515,689,462 $UST&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On May 10, when $UST had fallen to $0.75, pursuant to a Master Services Agreement dated January 10, 2022 through which TFL managed &amp;amp;amp; executed all finance, administrative &amp;amp;amp; operational functions &amp;amp;amp; support as requested, &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TFL, on behalf of the Foundation, executed the following exchange trades in a last ditch effort to defend the peg:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As of now, the Foundation’s remaining reserves consist of the following assets:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;· 313 $BTC&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;· 39,914 $BNB&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;· 1,973,554 $AVAX&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This sub has many posts of people saying goodbye recently and I think these events mark a possible bottom for the market in my opinion. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto fundamentals never changed, bitcoin is still scarce, ethereum is still the biggest smart contract platform,  and the other developments are also the same. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you are a Dev you will probably enjoy this time to build a project and have time to polish it and gather backers and a member base. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you are a normal investor then you aren&amp;amp;#39;t having a great time looking at the color red everyday.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The Luna crash is still reverberating in the markets and people are still anxious to put money back into crypto. If a stablecoin could fail, what else would your average person put money into? It’s a scary thought. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But Luna had to crash. Because imagine, if Luna didn’t crash. It was already on a meteoric rise this year. And when the depressed crypto market came back alive, Luna would shoot back up to $100, if not go beyond that. Luna was supposed to be the future of crypto. One of the market leaders. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If Luna didn’t crash now, but instead crashed when it’s gotten as big as Ethereum, at $500 billion, with the fundamental design problems that it has, I don’t know what would happen to crypto. Imagine if Ethereum went to zero tonight. That could potentially kill crypto for a few years, if not set it back a decade in terms of mass adoption. If the crypto market leaders fail, the entire crypto space becomes tainted and shunned. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now that Luna has failed, other algo stablecoins can learn from these mistakes. Create a better project, addressing these fundamental design issues. These are the growing pains that the crypto market needs while it’s still very young. Because ten years from now, these mistakes won’t be as tolerated.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The idea of losing all my Bitcoin really made me feel very uneasy, the solution was obvious, get a hardware wallet.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Setting up the Ledger Nano S was easy and transferring my BTC liberating, I can feel a weight lifted from my shoulders knowing I now have full control of my keys and my crypto. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If anyone is wondering &amp;amp;#39;what happens if Ledger go out of business?&amp;amp;#39; fear not! If Ledger did i go out of business, neither your cryptocurrency nor your private and public keys would disappear. You are totally safe.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Any investor that knows how to control these feels needs to have A LOT of will power and patience which obviously gives them an upper hand over other investors.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I myself haven&amp;amp;#39;t been able to master these emotions yet and a big part of this is cause I started out investing in meme coins and shit coins which are VERY panic and FOMO inducing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;See, what I’ve noticed with these calm and collected investors is that the majority of their investments are put into projects which have unique technology and most importantly a ton of development going around which almost always ensures that said projects will make it out of a crash in one piece.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some examples would be Ethereum with tons of technology and real world applications available or projects like Hedera with a ton of development going around now that Hbar Foundation is expanding their ecosystem with more than half a billion in funds allocated just for that.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There are a pretty big handful of projects that fit in this category and learning to invest in them and wait for the long term will help you learn how to control FOMO by not following the hype and will help you control panic by holding on these projects with good long term fundamentals.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Enough nodes are being targeted to cause settlement delays network-wide. Every targetted node is slower in processing, thus everything from block propagation to block confirmation is slower. Additionally, enough bandwidth is being used such that some targeted nodes may be at risk of filling up their disk (unchecked blocks get cleared every 4 hrs and on load — can also be cleared manually).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When the load subsides, the network will recover. The impact of this attack is settlement delays, no funds can be lost. According to my non-voting nodes, the average election duration is around 53 seconds currently (12:27 PM EST).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Developers are aware and have been working and discussing a variety of solutions (some new, some old). This is a good time to remind everyone of a few things:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;• network resilience is not binary (fixed / not fixed) and much more than just dealing with &amp;amp;quot;spam&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;• network resilience has been a focus, is a focus, and will continue to need to be a focus.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;• settlement delays and disruptions are to be expected as this is an experimental network under active development. I recommend being aware of these basics.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s going to take a lot of time and contributions before the network is sufficiently resilient (on a variety of fronts). This is the nature of building an open and distributed network, there are currently a number of known ways a motivated attacker can disrupt (or even take down) the network. The network becomes resilient over time with each newly discovered vulnerability and subsequent contribution of solutions/fixes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Over the years there have been 30+ disclosed ways to take down the Bitcoin network, which is simpler to defend in a number of ways. The nano network is not going to be any different.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Apple makes phones, Spotify gives you music streaming, Chase keeps your money safe, KFC serves you chicken wings, Zoom helps employees communicate, but what the fuck does Solana do for you? Currently valued at 18 billion, but why?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How can my mom benefit from Solana for example? How can a company benefit from Solana? And how is it different from Avalance, Aave, Matic &amp;amp;amp; the hundreds of other projects?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Remember, try to reply to me as if you were talking to a no-coiner, use real world example preferably.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Edit :&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; I&amp;amp;#39;m aware of the very obvious money transfer aspect, which is actually great yes, but there are thousands of cryptos offering exactly that.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I know there are many phone, banks and clothing companies too, but designer clothing doesn&amp;amp;#39;t serve the same consumers as kids clothing, just like with premium phones/cheap android phones or islamic banks/off-shore banks. Variety is necessary, but when it comes to money transfer, you just want it done as cheap and fast as possible.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So what does justify the existence of thousands of projects serving the same purpose (p2p transfers) more than 10 years after the invention of Bitcoin, some with billions in market cap?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Having barely heard of the project up until this week and to have seen it’s price plummet from the $100s to the $0.00001s I have decided I now no longer wanna sit on the sidelines of this epic excitement. I want in! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;$2 AUD of LUNA has yielded me 12,000 odd Luna at the time of posting.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I am fully prepared to wave that $2 goodbye. I Honestly didn’t feel like a coffee this morning but preferred to be involved in this monumental crypto saga. I gave up my coffee for this.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Wonder how this will age :D&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The reward will be cut in half from BTC 6.25 to BTC 3.125 per block mined.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Do we expect a reaction to the next halving?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Well at the previous Bitcoin halving (May 11 of 2020), we didn&amp;amp;#39;t notice any significant changes in the case of the price, BTC ended the day slightly lower, but according to some bystanders halving was one of the triggers for the major bull run that started 2 months later.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/8n20qtfnjjz81.png?width=631&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=bd12f5a1558c201db5e7e131f5cda4c5c8025e60&quot;&amp;gt;price reaction to 3 of the halvings we had&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What we do know is that rewards will be halved and prices will therefore have to rise for &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;mining to remain profitable.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Satoshi himself has written in one of his replies that it would make sense for prices to rise.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/k1crep6vjjz81.png?width=879&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=7bffaf614a05f3e2c089f57a890094d3fd691736&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/k1crep6vjjz81.png?width=879&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=7bffaf614a05f3e2c089f57a890094d3fd691736&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: Word &amp;amp;quot;should&amp;amp;quot; is not the perfect fit for the title. I could&amp;amp;#39;ve expressed myself a little bit better.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Let&amp;amp;#39;s say: will bitcoin&amp;amp;#39;s price increase after the next halving? Your thoughts?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“I still believe in algorithmic stablecoins,” he told CoinDesk in a Zoom interview, which was scheduled before any of the market turmoil surfaced. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hmmm, so USDD will maintain its peg by a minting/burn process that will convert one USDD to $1 worth of TRX, the native token of the Tron blockchain. And $1 worth of TRX could be burned to mint one USDD. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
