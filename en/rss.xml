According to Alderoty, the SEC would deliberately try to delay the lawsuit between themselves and Ripple as long as possible.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Ripple lawsuit&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Ripple, meanwhile, has been embroiled in an infamous lawsuit with the US SEC for over a year. The SEC accuses Ripple of selling securities in the past without the necessary licenses. At the moment, Ripple is hopeful that the lawsuit will soon come to an end and the judge will finally issue a ruling. However, Alderoty lashed out at the SEC on Twitter. He believes that the SEC does not want the court case to end any time soon.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/jisowqdswhb81.png?width=498&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=4e9c680ce369d60ff1003268f0fa06d86912468a&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/jisowqdswhb81.png?width=498&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=4e9c680ce369d60ff1003268f0fa06d86912468a&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Gary Gensler&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the series of Twitter messages, Alderoty responds to a message from SEC Chairman Gary Gensler. Gensler revealed why, in his opinion, enforcement of rules is one of the SEC&amp;amp;#39;s most important tasks. Soccer without referees would turn into an unfair occupation in no time according to Gensler. If teams don&amp;amp;#39;t have to worry about penalties and enforcement of the rules, things will go wrong. The same goes for the markets, according to Gensler. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/dmwxeixuwhb81.png?width=509&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=0ef5caa037c3fe6e1f067f0eed849ae04b274c14&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/dmwxeixuwhb81.png?width=509&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=0ef5caa037c3fe6e1f067f0eed849ae04b274c14&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Alderoty argues that the SEC is guilty of &amp;amp;quot;regulation by enforcement.&amp;amp;quot; That by simply initiating a lawsuit against an entity they are trying to control certain markets. This is also why, according to Alderoty, the SEC does not seem to be in any particular hurry in the lawsuit.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Ripple&amp;amp;#39;s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, still seemed convinced in November of last year that the lawsuit will end this year. In addition, he is hopeful that the judge&amp;amp;#39;s ruling will also be in Ripple&amp;amp;#39;s favor.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I sort by New due to wanting to read and comment on brand new post and I have now seen this  post about Kim kardashian and Floyd Maywether getting sued over some crypto scam posted Dozens of times if not hundreds. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I would like to state up front that I am in favor of moon farming but feel like a little bit of effort should be put in, not just constantly posting news articles that have already been posted. I am not asking for much, just a quick search to see if its been posted ten times in the last hour already. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Is there a solution to this? Perhaps&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But I dont have any answers or the power to make any changes on this sub, I just wanted to let you guys know that Kim and Floyd are getting sued and its crypto related.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now that everybody knows this, please stop posting the same articles over and over and I will give every post after mine that is not a news article an award until I run out of my Reddit coins.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thank you for attending my Rant, and may you be blessed with awards and moons in this difficult time.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We also think there is very high stakes game theory at play here, whereby if bitcoin adoption increases, the countries that secure some bitcoin today will be better off competitively than their peers. Therefore, even if other countries do not believe in the investment thesis or adoption of bitcoin, they will be forced to acquire some as a form of insurance. In other words, a small cost can be paid today as a hedge compared to a potentially much larger cost years in the future. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;We therefore wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t be surprised to see other sovereign nation states acquire bitcoin in 2022 and perhaps even see a central bank make an acquisition.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I did this a few times actually without  issues. It seemed as reliable as any exchange - pancake swap, 1inch,  uniswap,  raydium, etc...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The site was even verified by Haze crypto when I used it months ago, but it has since been updated and now warns of the site as a scam. I&amp;amp;#39;m unsure if  I&amp;amp;#39;m allowed to post the name of the exchange site, a mod can tell me if its ok. I actually hadn&amp;amp;#39;t even used the site this year.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The scammers were patient. They waited until the wallet had more funds in it than it did when first connected. Around $1400 BUSD worth.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How did it happen?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I found the transaction on bscscan and traced the wallet address back to the exchange site. I remembered using it once last year, but not much more. So I decided to create another wallet and conducted some tiny transactions to try to figure out how the scam worked.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is what I believe happened.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The wallet was connected to the exchange like any other. The exchange was audited and seemed legit. I performed tiny transaction of some BUSD and the approval request from Metamask appeared. Looking carefully, I noticed that the approval button was designed to approve THREE (3) transactions. One was the transacrtion I had made, but one of the other transactions was &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;an authorisation for the exchange to withdraw up to $100000000 BUSD!&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What the hell? I never noticed a transaction like that before. I checked my main Metamask and found the same type of authorisation last year. Shit. Somehow hidden among normal transactions I had approved a request to allow this exchange to withdraw funds whenever they fucking wanted. All they had to do was watch my wallet transactions and determine a point when they thought I currently had a lot more money than usual stored.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How to prevent in the future?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Naturally, I was concerned that I had conducted similar type transaction approval requests in the past, so I started to research how to check who/what else has access to my wallet. I fortunately fopund nothing else of concern. But I wanted to share how to check it for yourselves.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Firstly, Make sure that existing connected sites are accurate.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anything   you don&amp;amp;#39;t use anymore, or worse, don&amp;amp;#39;t recognise should be immediately   removed. This is easy to do. Open your wallet, click the three dots  and  select &amp;amp;#39;connected sites&amp;amp;#39;, browse through the list and revoke  anything  that you don&amp;amp;#39;t want.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Secondly, revoke any tokens. This is likely something very few people do.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;And this is how I got scammed.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For Ethereum Mainnet/Binance Smart Chain, visit the site token checker on ethscan/bscscan. Enter your ETH/BSC wallet address and browse though the list. Revoke anything you no longer use.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;EDIT:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thank you to all the people who DMd and thanked me for alerting them to the issue of token approval. Some people said they found dozens of connected sites and tokens that they hadn&amp;amp;#39;t touched in a very long time. I&amp;amp;#39;m grateful some people found my experience beneficial.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The mod said it was ok to post a screenshot. See below. The issue that I was trying to raise was not so much the site itself, but the ability for most sites to connect your token with unlimited access.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

This upgrade is set to change the entire fee market operations on the Ethereum network, as it will be bringing a discrete fee base that is burned instead of being paid to the miners, and an elimination to the first-price auction mechanism.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This upgrade won’t be having a direct impact on the gas fees, but it will be allowing the users to estimate the costs better.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Another main impact of this upgrade is that it’ll be having a deflationary impact on MATIC. Since Polygon’s total supply of tokens is fixed at 10 billion, the reduction of the token number will be having a direct deflationary impact on the asset. A we know, 0.27% of the total supply will be burned annually, which means 27 million MATIC. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This upgrade is going to have a positive impact on the dApps users, as they’ll be enjoying even lower fees, and developers will be receiving a boost as well. Not to forget that the EIP 1559 will also minimize the number of spam transactions and the network congestion. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Finally, will this upgrade have a direct impact on MATIC’s price?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

However, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/technology/quarter-small-businesses-across-nine-countries-plan-offer-crypto-payments-visa-2022-01-12/&quot;&amp;gt;research from Visa&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; shows that 2022 has even more in store for mainstream crypto adoption. In fact, a whopping 25% of small businesses in 9 different countries plan to start accepting crypto payments this year.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Companies exceed consumer expectations&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The survey was conducted among 2,250 small businesses in 9 different countries. These are the United States, Canada, Brazil, Singapore, Germany, Ireland, Russia, the United Arab Emirates and Hong Kong. Also, 1,000 Americans and 500 residents in each country were asked for their opinions. In doing so, the survey covers almost all continents and provides a nice picture of the average sentiment worldwide.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Visa reports that 25% of these 2,250 businesses plan to accept crypto payments by 2022. This is while among consumers, only 13% expect companies to do so. Jeni Mundy, global head of merchant sales at Visa, states that more trust seems to be emerging:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;I think more people are more confident in crypto,&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Interest in crypto especially outside North America&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Furthermore, the survey revealed that it is mainly companies outside North America that are interested in accepting crypto payments. In North America, only 19% (US) and 8% (Canada) say they have these plans. In the United Arab Emirates, Singapore, Hong Kong and Brazil, the percentage is as high as 30%. Even companies that do not want to accept crypto this year may change tack later. Indeed, the survey also shows that three-quarters of companies believe that expanding payment options is &amp;amp;quot;fundamental&amp;amp;quot; to their business growth. Mundy argues that it is a &amp;amp;quot;natural evolution&amp;amp;quot; to accept crypto over time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Visa happy with results&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The results will be music to Visa&amp;amp;#39;s ears. After all, the payments giant is betting big on crypto. Last year, for example, it launched a crypto consulting service. In addition, the company made a promise to continue supporting crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Kraken and Avanti are two entities active in Crypto business ,both have received permission under Wyoming law to become Special Purpose Depository Institutions(SDPI)-a new type of financial entity that can transact in Crypto while also performing traditional banking services. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After receiving SDPI charter from authorities,next step is to require a master account at Federal Reserve to arrange payments with Central Bank and conduct settlements with other financial institutions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But here comes the main problem, Federal Reserve blocked the applications to open the master account without any legitimate reasons.Not only this, Federal Reserve sat on SDPI applications for more than a year and has been slow to communicate with Crypto Banks on why the whole process is taking so much time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fed Chair Jerome Powell defending the FED&amp;amp;#39;s decision to block Crypto Banks with this statement &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;if we start granting these, there will be a couple hundred of them soon.They are hugely precedential, which is why I am taking my time on this&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Even though Mr. Jerome Powell agreed that there are good arguments for treating them as eligible to receive accounts.Just because it&amp;amp;#39;s &amp;amp;quot;Crypto Bank&amp;amp;quot; they can&amp;amp;#39;t get the permission for master account.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And people think authorities are now realizing the potential of Crypto and ready to accept it as a part of financial system.They are just saying nice words so that their public image remain intact, and their actions are in the direction to stop Crypto at any cost. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A point to note here is- he was a part of Sen.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The lawsuit in itself is not concerning but when you connect the dots on who filed the lawsuit and the purpose behind it- you see that this is but a malicious attempt of ridiculing crypto by only emphasizing a small proportion of use case. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They&amp;amp;#39;re having much bigger problems than mining, I can assure you that.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And if you really want to bring crypto into it, this might be the chance for alts to finally decouple from BTC.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It’s slowly but surely happening and I already bought some DeFi alts like Curve cause I think its the best DeFi project and some BitDAO considering how much they’ve been investing in the DeFi space recently.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The Green Line marks the low of 2041 of 1.8 Million Doller per 1 Bitcoin&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Price hit the Top of the Loga Channel in July 2011, Dec 2013 and the Dec 2017. From a historical perspective we can say that it needs around 4 years to hit the top. If this repeats, we will hit around 150.000 within the next months. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Welcome to your monthly no-shill data dump: Here&amp;amp;#39;s the FOUR YEAR REPORT for the 2018 Top Ten Experiment featuring &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BTC, XRP, ETH, BCH, ADA, LTC, NEM, DASH, IOTA,&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Stellar.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;tl;dr&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;What&amp;amp;#39;s this all about?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven&amp;amp;#39;t sold or traded, reporting every single month for four years. Did the same in 2019, 2020, 2021, and more recently, the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2022/&quot;&amp;gt;2022 Top Ten a few weeks ago&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;here&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Snapshots taken on the 1st of each month.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;December&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Highlights:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; A bloody, all-red month&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Overall since Jan. 2018:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;ETH&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; solidly in the lead, followed by &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BTC&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;ADA.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;  After briefly pulling ahead earlier in the year, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;the 2018 Top Ten are now significantly underperforming the S&amp;amp;amp;P 500&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; over the same time period.  Q: So, big crypto fail, right?&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A: Only if I stopped after the first year.  The &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;2018+2019+2020+2021 Combined Top Ten Portfolios are returning 406%, much, much better than traditional markets over the same time period (&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;fancy new chart at the very bottom of the post).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Some exciting new changes for&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2022/&quot;&amp;gt;2022&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;!&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;ll focus on 2022 Top Ten Portfolio reports + one other portfolio on a rotating basis (down to two reports per month)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Incorporated Decentralized Finance (DeFi) for the first time. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Factoring in stablecoin gains:  In past years, I have not included the ROI that is possible with stables in the monthly reports.  This year, I will detail ways to build on the $100 of USDC in the 2022 portfolio and gamify it a bit: my goal is to outperform as many as the other cryptos in the 2022 Top Ten Portfolio as possible (simple if it turns out to be a bear year, a bit more challenging if the 2022 market moons).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Giveaways: Who doesn’t love a good old fashioned giveaway? I’ll be giving away crypto during the year, either through Twitter, Reddit, or my email list. I’m still figuring out the details, but aim to give away around $100 a month in crypto.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Friendly competition: I will compare my homemade 2022 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment to a Total Crypto Market Cap Index Token ($TCAP &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/TotalCryptoMarketCap&quot;&amp;gt;r/TotalCryptoMarketCap&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;) to see which one outperforms.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And here we go!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Four Year Report – UP 34%&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/c3c6wlctpgb81.jpg?width=1056&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=380248b14486edaa5749fba7a390198bf81260a0&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/c3c6wlctpgb81.jpg?width=1056&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=380248b14486edaa5749fba7a390198bf81260a0&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Welcome to the four year report!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Portfolio is &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BTC, XRP, ETH, BCH, ADA, LTC, IOTA, NEM, Dash,&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Stellar&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;December highlights for the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;100% red month&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;IOTA&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; falls the least, only down -4% (on news that staking on the Firefly wallet will yield two cryptos, Assembly and Shimmer).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;ETH&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; maintains a solid overall lead, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BTC&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; in second place, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;ADA&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; in third.  Three coins in the green since January 2018.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;After four years, the 2018 Portfolio is +34%, behind the S&amp;amp;amp;P 500’s ROI over the same time period.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;December Ranking and Dropouts&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here’s a look at the movement in ranks since January 2018:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/ulc9dwgvpgb81.jpg?width=412&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=2eadc9a98ec75b726cef37af7cb716fddf3126db&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/ulc9dwgvpgb81.jpg?width=412&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=2eadc9a98ec75b726cef37af7cb716fddf3126db&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Top Ten dropouts since January 2018:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; After four years of the 2018 Top Ten Experiment, only 40% of the cryptos that &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/&quot;&amp;gt;started in the Top Ten&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; have remained.  &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;NEM, Dash, Stellar, Bitcoin Cash, IOTA&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Litecoin&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; have been replaced by &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Binance Coin, Tether&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;DOT, SOL&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;LUNA&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;USDC.  NEM&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; looks like it wants to be the first to drop out of the Top 100.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;December Winners and Losers&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;December Winners&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; –  &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;IOTA&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; outperformed the pack, dropping only -4% this month. 100% of the cryptos in the red.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;December Losers&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; –   Losing nearly a third of its value, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Litecoin&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; fell the most, down -30%. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;NEM&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; followed &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;LTC&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, dropping -27% in December.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Tally of Monthly Winners and Losers&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After four years, here’s a tally of the monthly winners and losers over the life of the 2018 Top Ten Experiment. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/lisz7rgxpgb81.jpg?width=411&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=cbf41f94e9716f0140f3a7dfff3f655fa9d21a59&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/lisz7rgxpgb81.jpg?width=411&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=cbf41f94e9716f0140f3a7dfff3f655fa9d21a59&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With 11, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Bitcoin&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; has two more monthly wins than second place &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Cardano&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.  &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;NEM&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; has finished last place most often (12 months out of 48).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Bitcoin&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; is still the only cryptocurrency that hasn’t yet lost a month since January 2018 (although it has come very close a couple of times).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Overall Update –  2021 ends with a whimper. After four years, ETH in first place, and Dash and NEM tied for worst overall performance.&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After reaching an All Time High (+72%) in &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-46&quot;&amp;gt;October&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio continued to lose value.  After four years of holding these cryptos, only 3 out of the 10 cryptos are in the green: &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BTC,&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;ETH,&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;ADA.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Overall, first place &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;ETH&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; (+413%) is well ahead of &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BTC&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; (+257%) and third place &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;ADA&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; (+99%).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The initial $100 invested in first place &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;ETH&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; four years ago?  It’s worth $515 today.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;DASH&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;NEM&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; are virtually tied at the bottom, both down over -86% since &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/&quot;&amp;gt;January 2018&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;  The initial $100 invested in each four ago is worth about $13 today.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Total Market Cap for the entire cryptocurrency sector:&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/mldnsr7zpgb81.png?width=582&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=d82435bc0e39657707f2143fb5dd1951f6ddcfd1&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/mldnsr7zpgb81.png?width=582&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=d82435bc0e39657707f2143fb5dd1951f6ddcfd1&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;End of December 2021 market cap: &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$2,211,626,655,207&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The total crypto market dropped significantly in December.  Crypto as a sector is still up +285% since &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/&quot;&amp;gt;January 2018&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There was no easy way to achieve this at the time, but if you were able to capture the entire crypto market since New Year’s Day 2018, you’d be doing much, much better than the Experiment’s Top Ten approach (+34%), the return of the S&amp;amp;amp;P (+78%) over the same period of time, and nine of the individual cryptos within the 2018 Top Ten (except for &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Ethereum)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto Market Cap Low Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$114B in&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-thirteen/&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;January 2019&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto Market Cap High Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$2.65T in&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-46/&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;October 2021&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Bitcoin dominance:&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/qygnx0a0qgb81.png?width=487&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=567958cf7214839fa7befa749d61125dade6a9a8&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/qygnx0a0qgb81.png?width=487&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=567958cf7214839fa7befa749d61125dade6a9a8&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BitDom&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; declined a bit in December, ending the month at 40.2%.  When looking at the entire four year 2018 Experiment time frame, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BTC&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; dominance is near the low end.  For context:   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Low Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;33% in January 2018&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;High Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-twenty/&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;70.5% in August 2019&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2018: &amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/cxtd9lb1qgb81.jpg?width=339&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=25b3da0034194812e2b66f977450fff1555b48fb&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/cxtd9lb1qgb81.jpg?width=339&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=25b3da0034194812e2b66f977450fff1555b48fb&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The 2018 Top Ten Portfolio lost $325 in December.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If I decided to cash out the 2018 Top Ten Experiment today, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;the $1000 initial investment would be worth $1,341&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, up 34% from &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/&quot;&amp;gt;January 2018&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Green is unfamiliar territory for the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio and a recent development.  Over the first four years of the 2018 Index Fund Experiment, thirty-eight months have been in the red, with only ten months of green.  And all ten of the green months have come in 2021. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here’s a look at the ROI over the life of the experiment, month by month, since the beginning of the 2018 Experiment four years ago:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/cbumx113qgb81.jpg?width=654&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=7bba9861143359ff6b70ff0ca8e6ba75de5d00d6&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/cbumx113qgb81.jpg?width=654&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=7bba9861143359ff6b70ff0ca8e6ba75de5d00d6&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The all time high for this portfolio is &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-46&quot;&amp;gt;October 2021&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; (+72%).  The lowest point was in January 2019 when the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio was down &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-thirteen/&quot;&amp;gt;-88%&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Remember: no one can predict the value of any crypto tomorrow, let alone next month or next year.  The 2018 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio was down -88% after one year, -80% after two years, -25% after three years.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Alright, that’s that for the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment recap.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But I didn’t stop the Experiment in 2018:  I invested another $1000 in the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;2019&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;2020,&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;2021&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Top Ten Cryptos as well (&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;(and, just announced,&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2022/&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;again in 2022&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;!)&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.  How are the other Crypto Index Fund Experiments doing?    &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-48&quot;&amp;gt;2018 Top Ten Experiment&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;: up +34% (total value $1,341)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-36&quot;&amp;gt;2019 Top Ten Experiment:&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; up +504% (total value $6,044)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-24&quot;&amp;gt;2020 Top Ten Experiment&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;: up +795% (total value $8,951)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-12&quot;&amp;gt;2021 Top Ten Experiment&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;: up +292% (total value $3,921)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So overall? Taking the four portfolios together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;bottom&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; line: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;After a $4,000 investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; the combined portfolios are worth &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$20,257&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; ($1,341 + $6,044 + $8,951 + $3,921).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;That’s up +406%&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; on the combined portfolios, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;down from&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-47&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;last month’s all time high&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiments.  Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/xcl80o35qgb81.jpg?width=511&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e2cd4923360a5492259faf606b3649c893fd4b16&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/xcl80o35qgb81.jpg?width=511&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e2cd4923360a5492259faf606b3649c893fd4b16&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;That’s a +406% gain by investing $1k in whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for four years in a row.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Comparison to S&amp;amp;amp;P 500:&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I’m also tracking the S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 as part of the Experiment to have a comparison point with other popular investments options.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/3uss07c8qgb81.png?width=582&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=3e68ae4c88a82ff35b70538ec11dd137e83447e2&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/3uss07c8qgb81.png?width=582&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=3e68ae4c88a82ff35b70538ec11dd137e83447e2&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After four years: the S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 is up +78% since January 2018, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/&quot;&amp;gt;January 1st, 2018&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; would be worth $1,780 had it been redirected to the S&amp;amp;amp;P.  That’s more than double the +34% return of the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio over the same period of time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;$1000 investment in S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1,780 today&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;$1000 investment in S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1,900 today&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;$1000 investment in S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,480 today&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;$1000 investment in S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,270 today&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Taken together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;bottom&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; line for a similar approach with the S&amp;amp;amp;P: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;After four $1,000 investments into an S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, my portfolio would be worth $6,430&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; ($1,780 + $1,900 + $1,480 + $1,270)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That is up &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;+61%&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/&quot;&amp;gt;since January 2018&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; compared to a &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;+406%&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here’s a fancy new chart showing the four year ROI comparison between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&amp;amp;amp;P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/gnkxsud9qgb81.png?width=575&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=3f94a09a11a36620fca7b8630d615420049141b2&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/gnkxsud9qgb81.png?width=575&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=3f94a09a11a36620fca7b8630d615420049141b2&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Conclusion:&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Many thanks to the long-time Experiment followers, appreciate you taking the time to follow along over the years.  For those just getting into crypto, welcome! I hope these reports can somehow give you a taste of what you may be in for as you begin your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, think long term, don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose, and try to enjoy the ride! Feel free to reach out with any questions and stay tuned for monthly progress reports. Keep an eye out for my parallel projects where I repeat the experiment, purchasing another $1000 ($100 each) of new sets of Top Ten cryptos as of &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-36&quot;&amp;gt;January 1st, 2019&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-24&quot;&amp;gt;January 1st, 2020&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-12&quot;&amp;gt;January 1st, 2021&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, and most recently, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2022/&quot;&amp;gt;January 1st, 2022&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I also want to add that they are far from perfect, their app is so ridiculously slow and I hate that I have to use a mobile phone instead of a desktop, both drive me mad. Also I know it&amp;amp;#39;s not decentralised so a lot of the crypto &amp;amp;#39;purists&amp;amp;#39; are not going to like it (even though no crypto coin where you can just buy a controlling quantity with the only limitation being having enough money was never truly decentralised in my opinion).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That said I think they have structured their business model perfectly towards the average person:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;1) You need to have almost zero knowledge to buy CRO and stake it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;2) Their pre paid debit card is the best bridge I&amp;amp;#39;ve seen so far between fiat and crypto, you just spend your fiat and get crypto in return. It doesn&amp;amp;#39;t require all the world&amp;amp;#39;s companies to change their payment systems and pricing structure. Everything stays in fiat and the user gets the reward. Also it looks super cool and makes people want to show it off.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;3) Their daily missions encourage a repeating $20 daily DCA which is perfect for teaching new investors to put in gradually and repeatedly rather than dumping a 4/5 digit lump sum all in on one price point, often near ATHs.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;4) They offer decent staking rewards although you do need a large bag of CRO to access it which I feel is a bit off-putting.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;5) They are doing real marketing, buying stadiums and paying Matt Damon to be in their adverts. Compare that to someone like LRC who also have a fait on ramp and wallet system and their marketing consists of a guy posting laser eye memes on twitter and discord and saying things like &amp;amp;quot;WAGMI&amp;amp;quot;. I know Matt Damon was just paid to be in an advert but I still trust any company that can actually afford to hire him far more than a company that cannot / will not spend that money.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;6) The coin price point is something that retail can understand, it&amp;amp;#39;s not a scary large number like BTC but it&amp;amp;#39;s also not 6 0s after a decimal like a lot of shitcoins.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;7) Their model is built around buying and holding their coin for other rewards which is, again, great at teaching retail to HODL rather than the only means of value to try and sell at a higher price point that pretty much the rest of the crypto market exists on.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I started in 2017 and saw my portfolio plummet to next to nothing after the big pump we all know.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I was in debts but I made it anyway and reloaded when the price was at its lowest during 2018/2019. Most were calling for the final death of crypto and a few saw a huge opportunity.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you become wealthy one day and they call you lucky, tell them it’s not about luck but you’re simply not the kind that gives up easily mostly when you have convictions about something.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Only 1% of the worldwide population uses crypto, we are still early and there’s still plenty opportunities to become &amp;amp;quot;lucky&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;See a coin has pumped 5-10% in a day, go all in on that bad boi before the inevitable dip that follows takes you back down to where the price started and you 5-10% lower.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Get a random bunch of coins in your wallet, DEFINETELY try and sell them because they are a scam and will steal a bunch of your coins from you.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Always be moving coins around, doesn&amp;amp;#39;t matter where to or from just keep em moving into and out of wallets, onto exchanges, off exchanges.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Try and convert your coins into other coins at least once a day, that way you are still gambling that the price of a single coin is either gonna go up or down but this way you get to eat up a few extra conversion fees.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;See a coin with an APR in the XXXXX% range, you buy that right up and just watch you money drain away.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Meme coins are a great way to lose money, just wait until they are mainstream and have shot up about 100 x in less than a month and are in the top 10s then you are guaranteed to be buying at the top.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;See a new coin fresh on the market, that&amp;amp;#39;s probably a rug pull so that&amp;amp;#39;s an easy way to loose a chunk of cash without putting in any effort at all.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Market down about 50% from ATH&amp;amp;#39;s, this is ALWAYS the best time to sell. You&amp;amp;#39;re almost certainly at the bottom at this point and you gotta get out before the price returns and you make your money back!&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Buy wallets for all the companies, even though you have coins with less value than the cost of the wallet. Gotta get that $50 off the exchanges after all!&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;DCA into projects but do it in that way where you DCA MORE when the market is going up and then kinda slack off of it when the markets are down with that &amp;amp;#39;I&amp;amp;#39;ll wait and see mentality&amp;amp;#39; because the E in DCA stands for emotion and you need to always include that when you are making financial investment plans!&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

But if the price was being presented and talked about in terms of Satoshis would a lot more people be willing to invest? Would we get more of the shitcoin investors willing to buy into bitcoin? I know the math is all the same, but the psychology of investing $100 and getting 0.0022727273 of something (btc) doesn&amp;amp;#39;t seem as appealing as investing $100 and getting 227,272.73 of something (sats) does. And I think a lot of people who invest in shitcoins like that they can own thousands or millions of something and hope the price rises. If people looked at the price of 1 sat (0.00044) would they be more or less willing to invest? Curious what people think about this?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;79,808 addresses hold less than 10 Moons&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;This is how things have changed since the last round&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;(I gathered the data last month but I didnt post it for some reason, I was probably busy or just forgot&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Ever since Moons moved to the new network last year its been a pain in my assholes trying to get the data from the new block explorer page.Luckily my dude &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/u/ominous_anenome&quot;&amp;gt;/u/ominous_anenome&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; created ccmoons and made it waaayyy easier to get the data.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I did have to edit the data slightly as ccmoons doesnt show balances &amp;amp;lt;1 Moon, so I averaged all those addresses out so the total holder number and total Moons matched the figures on &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://testnet.redditspace.com/tokens/0x138fAFa28a05A38f4d2658b12b0971221A7d5728/token-holders&quot;&amp;gt;Blockscout page&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. This might affect the mean and median figures but it&amp;amp;#39;s close enough for me.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

You may have also heard that the US federal reserve Bank (FED) and probably also the European Zentral Bank (EZB) are going to raise interest rates in the coming years to put everything to normal.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is what central bankers and high ranked politicians currently want you to belief, maybe some of them believe it themselves but it doesn&amp;amp;#39;t change the fact that it is a straight lie ! We are about to witness an unprecedented inflation period affecting the entire western world.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To prevent the whole system from collapsing, these authorities are doing the only thing they can. It is necessary to stretch this period over several years keep the masses calm during the process of devaluation. This is why they assure you: it is only transitory / we are raising interest rates and this will fix it / ... and so on. Sadly this is complete BS.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here is the real situation:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The FED and especially the EZB were buying government bonds with freshly printed money for years, to allow governments to spend money they don&amp;amp;#39;t have without paying interest on it. The pandemic was only the big final topping of a long term development that started after the 2008 crash. The amount of bonds the central banks are sitting on is enormous. Since 2008, the FED three-folded the amount of Dollar in existence and the EZB even six-folded the amount of Euro in existence. This money has already been created. This is not something that could eventually happen in the future. It has already happened.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In classic economy theory, it was assumed that an increase in the amount of money will directly result into inflation. But how was it then possible that they printed and spend these gigantic amounts of fresh money without causing inflation until now ? The answer to that was given by the work of the economist John Maynard Keynes. The short version is that freshly minted money is not causing instant inflation. There has to happen some kind of trickle down effect from the freshly minted money into the system which can take years. The inflation will first appear once the new money trickled down into the circulation spheres of the average people.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But this is not a matter of if, its a matter of when. The now starting inflation is basically the beginning of this trickle down effect reaching the financial spheres of average people. But sadly it is only the first tip of a giant amount that is yet to come. No raise of interest rate will prevent this, it will only slow it down. Ultimately, the money is printed and its just a matter of time until it trickles down.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With that in mind, we can try to make a rough estimate of the overall inflation ahead of us. The FED three-folded the amount of Dollar in existence and the EZB even six-folded the amount of Euro in existence. Therefore, once everything which is already printed yet has trickled down, the Dollar value will decrease to a third and the Euro value will decrease to a sixth. Depending on the time frame they manage to stretch the process, some of the inflation will be eaten up by economic growth, if there is one. However, including housing, energy, transportation and so on and not only the basic food basket used by the government, we can probably still expect around a decade with a real average annual inflation north of 8% in the US and even more in the EU.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As already said, a raise of interest rates wont prevent this because the money is already there. It has just not trickled down yet. A raise in interest rates only slows the process down because the entities (mostly Banks) that are currently sitting on all that money are less eager to spend it when they get interest on it. But this is only stretching it. Having it stretched over a longer period of years just makes the whole thing more digestible.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There is only one way to actually prevent this whole thing from happening, but this wont or cant be done. The central banks would need to sell these giant stacks of bonds they obtained and take the money back out of circulation (burning it) before it can trickle down. The problem with this is that would crush the entire bond market. This would lead to the majority of the balance sheets of all Banks becoming worthless and countries having to pay real interest rates again when borrowing money which most of them cant afford anymore. Ultimately this would bankrupt the whole western banking industry and probably also a lot of entire countries in the western world. Whole industries, currencies and maybe even societies would collapse. Or in other words: 2008 would look like a small correction compared to this.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I don&amp;amp;#39;t think I have to further explain why this is not an option. The way this will be played is to stretch it over a long time period to distribute the impact over years and being able to keep the majority calm until it is done. You will see, after a few years it will be the new normality to have this kind of inflation and the majority plus the media wont even care anymore. The value of the giant amounts of generational debt our governments and societies have created over the last decades will melt away. It will be a consolidation but also the biggest transfer of wealth witnessed in the younger history.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With this knowledge, it is about you to position yourself correctly in the upcoming era of inflation. The majority of the bill will be paid by ordinary people having a few thousand bucks in their saving accounts and low wage earners which wont get a sufficient raise in salary to compensate. The rich and wealthy have the majority of their wealth in equity and other goods. Some even have debt in Dollar on the other side. This is how you profit the most from whats coming up. Just look at Microstrategy for example. Creating Dollar debt in exchange for a scarce asset (Bitcoin). Debt devalues and the asset increases in value.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I am not trying to advocate taking debt here but everybody should at least think about not keeping significant amounts of money in currency over the next decade. Saving accounts are completely off limits in my opinion. If you are thinking about buying a flat or a house, now is probably the perfect time. Other possibilities to position yourself to protect hard earned value of your money are Gold, Stocks or of course Crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thank you for reading this long text and I hope it was somehow interesting for you.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;TL;DR: The current Inflation is absolutely not transitory. It will last for years and probably become a new normality. You should position yourself to protect the hard earned value of your money.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Remember that according to the stats, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;~75% of subscribers joined after January 2021&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. It&amp;amp;#39;s safe to assume they started their crypto journey around that time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Do you really expect newbies to be able to protect their seed phrase? Or not to mistakenly send their coin to the wrong address?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is much safer to keep them in exchange as long as it&amp;amp;#39;s the big one like Coinbase, Kraken, or Binance. Not to shady shit like Bitmart who listed every shitcoins out there. We have come a long way since Mt.Gox.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We should be glad that more and more people are investing in crypto. If someday managing own wallet is much simpler, then people will start transitioning by themselves.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

To get mass adoption to the levels we want, we need an iPhone style event into the market, by some massive and already well-established company. Sure LG and other companies made touch screen phones before Apple did, but Apple did it better and they made it much more simple to use. They&amp;amp;#39;ve dumbed down the whole thing, so even half-trained monkey could do it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is what we need in crypto. Right now all we have is a crap-ton of different chains, bridges, multiple ecosystems, multiple wallets etc. it&amp;amp;#39;s just too much for the average Joe. Heck, even for myself it was truly difficult to sell one coin the other day (not gonna shill here any names). It took me around 12 different steps, moving between bridges, converters and so on etc. before I was finally able to cash it out to FIAT without destroying myself with high fees to make it worthwhile. Sure, I could just cash out via traditional methods, but I&amp;amp;#39;d lose like 15% of my coins doing that. This stuff should be automated a long time ago.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But this will take time, a lot of time. The true adoption will start when we are allowed to just add crypto to our Google Pay or Apple Pay by scanning a quick QR code from our crypto wallet, without thinking two secs or giving a single fuck if our coins are going to disappear because we&amp;amp;#39;ve mistyped one or two letters in the wallet. Or because your wallet supports coins X, Y, Z but not coins A, B, C. Until then &amp;amp;quot;mass adoption&amp;amp;quot; is just an empty slogan that won&amp;amp;#39;t happen for another 10 years or more.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
