&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The US congress critters are attempting to further their autocratic bureaucracies with clamping down on crytpo.  Enabling non elected officials to make broad and uncontested changes in the financial sector. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A call to action like no other.  No one will contact your reps for you.  We need to stand together on this. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Charles Hoskinson of Cardano is trying to rally ALL crypto fans against the &amp;amp;quot;America Competes Act&amp;amp;quot; for giving the Treasury Secretary unilateral powers against cryptocurrencies. One Senator with ties to banking has snuck this into a bill that has absolutely nothing to do with crypto. If this passes, the Treasury Secretary could just decide that crypto should be illegal. No debate, no hearings, just unilateral power. Call your local Rep/Senator and let them hear that this is NOT representation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Ah yes, the holidays. A time for feasting, partying, reconnecting, and yes, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;financial advice&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. After being in crypto for a few years, I decided this holiday season was the time I would finally come out of the crypto closet to my family. I told them about the fundamentals of DeFi. I told them about specific projects I am invested in. I suggested to them to invest also.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Well, some of them did invest, and they’ve been staring at the same red dildos for the past month as the rest of us. Having bought in before the crash and with no bear market experience, some of them even sold at a loss. Tbh I think they aped with all their holiday checks and a few months savings.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The other half who didn’t buy refrained from doing so because they think I’m an idiot for buying crypto. It’s fair to say they think I’m more of an idiot now.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TL/DR: The half of my family who bought in wants to burn my house down, and the other half thinks I’m a clown with my magic internet money. Hooray for me.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I would expect Reddit to be equally if not more supportive of crypto than the general public or that I might expect to see from say in a comments section on Yahoo News, however when I see Bitcoin or Crypto mentioned in more mainstream Reddit subs like &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/news&quot;&amp;gt;r/news&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; or others everyone seems to be talking shit about &amp;amp;quot;crypto bros&amp;amp;quot; or making references to Beanie Babies, its kind of crazy to me as Reddit tends to sku younger and be very tech friendly. Here&amp;amp;#39;s some of the types of comments I&amp;amp;#39;m talking about and these are like handpicked comments this sentiment seems to be the majority.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Looks like Cryptobros will have to go back to Amway.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Pyramid scheme&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Anyone who thinks the world&amp;amp;#39;s governments and central banks are going to allow unregulated virtual currency to take over is dillusional.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;&amp;amp;quot;Let&amp;amp;#39;s pretend a speculative asset masquerading as the most deflationary currency ever is the future of finance. This is a Very Good Idea and I&amp;amp;#39;m actually an expert on economics, not a con artist trying to attract as many suckers as possible to pay me real money for my hoarded assets.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;I’m not convinced it is here to stay. What is the utility of bitcoin? At least gold is used in electronics, jewelry etc…&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Digital Beanie Babies.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;I put my entire net worth into beanie babies and He-Man action figures.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;I mean NFTs are basically the crypto equivalent of beanie babies with the difference being that with beanie babies you actually have something that is worth a damn whereas NFTs are a fucking worthless scam.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Jesus fuck what is wrong with that dude?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;El Salvadors President Jesus fuck what is wrong with that dude?&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;This year, I invested in pumpkins. They&amp;amp;#39;ve been going up the whole month of October and I got a feeling they&amp;amp;#39;re going to peak right around January. Then, bang! That&amp;amp;#39;s when I&amp;amp;#39;ll cash in.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;I’m sticking with my tulip bulbs.I’m sticking with my tulip bulbs.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Obligatory Beanie Babies vs Bitcoin Investment Guide&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;This happens to things whose only value is derived from what people are willing to pay for it. That bitcoin is worth anything is only because people think they will be able to sell it for more than they bought/manufactured it for. Maybe I&amp;amp;#39;m wrong, but I don&amp;amp;#39;t think bitcoin is substantially different than beanie babies. If people decide it&amp;amp;#39;s no longer valued, it&amp;amp;#39;s just virtual junk.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;COVID. All the predictions of OMICRON disaster were wildly overstated. Here in the UK, ALL restrictions will be permanently abolished from this Saturday. The same in several other European countries.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Ukraine. Despite the chest thumping, there will be no major conflagration in Ukraine. Russia cannot afford to lose face and will back down - whilst making a small, grandiose gesture.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Putin has confirmed that Russia will NOT be banning crypto. That was obvious, but it&amp;amp;#39;s still bullish news.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;BTC Futures are currently at 0.93 - the highest for some time. The markets have fully priced in the gradual phasing out of tapering and up to 4 x 0.25% rate increase this year.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Global supply chains are recovering faster than governments expected. Again, this is due to Covid becoming less menacing.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The US Labor Market is now officially &amp;amp;#39;Strong&amp;amp;#39;.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

If you don&amp;amp;#39;t, you will probably read about it in the history books for it may have been one of the most important meetings in modern history.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Granted this is reddit so I don&amp;amp;#39;t have any proof, but it makes a lot of sense so follow along:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Erdogan has been orange pilled. I think he, as well as anyone, realizes that American empire is collapsing. There is zero appetite for any military action &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;anywhere&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; and barring some Pearl Harbour-like event, I don&amp;amp;#39;t see the US going to war for anything.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So the world police has left the station, and they&amp;amp;#39;re not coming back. When America is no longer interested in world affairs, all of the institutions America built during the post-war era will fall as well. The purpose of institutions like the IMF and the World Bank was always to serve America&amp;amp;#39;s interests, ideological or Machiavellian. Without the US steering the ship, they will be lost and eventually rendered completely neutered. It will be like the Oscar&amp;amp;#39;s of politics; no one will even care enough to notice when it&amp;amp;#39;s finally gone.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This of course leaves a huge power vacuum in all sorts of different avenues, especially in international trade. Through the Petrodollar system, all oil trade around the world settles in USD. This gave the US immense soft power, since all oil importing countries like Turkey are forced to acquire dollars somehow and if they want to acquire dollars, they have to follow America&amp;amp;#39;s wishes. If they didn&amp;amp;#39;t want to adhere to the rules of the Petrodollar, they were free to join Saddam Hussein and Gaddafi six feet down under.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But like we&amp;amp;#39;ve already established; the US won&amp;amp;#39;t do another Iraq, nor another Libya. There is so little appetite for war that I believe that any attempt to start one might be enough to ignite a domestic revolution. The time for countries to free themselves from the Petrodollar is ripe.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Countries like Turkey then have two options; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Either they enter a similar agreement with China, and let China become the new global super power who gets to call the shots.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;or they will build alternative systems where no single super power is in control.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I think it is fairly obvious what alternative is preferable for anyone who isn&amp;amp;#39;t Chinese. The only question is &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;how&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; would anyone be able to build institutions that can withstand Chinese pressure?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Enter bitcoin. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here one might question whether the ideals of bitcoin are compatible with an increasingly authoritarian Turkish government. I don&amp;amp;#39;t think however that Erdogan, nor any other leader, is particularly ideological. They want to stay in power of course but &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;how&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; they do so isn&amp;amp;#39;t the central focus. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyone who lives in a country that has been bullied by super powers knows the shame it brings to the people. It is one thing to be pushed around by one of your own, but to be pushed around by foreigners? A million times worse. If leaders of smaller countries like Erdogan, Bukele etc. manage to free their countries from American control &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;without&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; entering a similarly abusive relationship with China, they will forever be entrenched in the nation&amp;amp;#39;s collective memory, and they realize this. Bitcoin is their opportunity to do precisely that. In my opinion, it is their only option. They will never be able to convince any other country of joining an international monetary network that themselves control. But convincing other countries to join a network &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;no one&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; controls might actually not be a very difficult task, for the reasons stated above. Every single country in the world are sick and tired of getting bullied by America and the last thing they want is to be bullied by a new super power, regardless of how authoritarian the regime might be. Bitcoin is the key that solves this puzzle. Bukele was the first head of state to come to this realization. He will not be the last.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TLDR;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The 20th century was the era of centralisation. With the fall of the American empire, we will enter an era of decentralisation. All the pieces are in play and now we are just waiting for the dominos to fall.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To finish this, I&amp;amp;#39;d like to end with a quote from Erdogan from last month:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Turkey will never again submit its political and economic future to the prescriptions of global economic tutelage institutions, such as the IMF and similar institutions,&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aa.com.tr/en/politics/turkey-will-never-submit-its-economic-future-to-imf-president-erdogan/2435775&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.aa.com.tr/en/politics/turkey-will-never-submit-its-economic-future-to-imf-president-erdogan/2435775&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sounds familiar?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The follow up press conference didn&amp;amp;#39;t sound that bullish. While the minutes indicated that there is no increased rates from what&amp;amp;#39;s already planned, JPow had some hawkish undertones in his answers. Nothing sounded too dovish.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And he is even now saying there could be increases.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We are back to neutral...maybe even bearish.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But there is a lot of fog in JPow&amp;amp;#39;s answers. And he said a lot of the decisions will come in the next meeting in March with more details on numbers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Stock crash potentially back on the table. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;____________________&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;del&amp;gt;As you might have already guessed with stocks shooting up, and cryptos spking, we didn&amp;amp;#39;t get the doom and gloom news today, we got some moderately bullish news.&amp;lt;/del&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;del&amp;gt;Keep in mind, inflation is still very high, so it&amp;amp;#39;s not all rosy either.&amp;lt;/del&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;del&amp;gt;So long term, there are still major economic issues looming.&amp;lt;/del&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;del&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s also not super bullish for liquidity, or artificially propping up stocks with lowered rates.&amp;lt;/del&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;del&amp;gt;But it&amp;amp;#39;s a fine balance, and probably a best case scenario.&amp;lt;/del&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;del&amp;gt;In the minutes they mention unemployment has dropped, and the economic outlook is improving, according to the Fed.&amp;lt;/del&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;del&amp;gt;So maybe no stock market crash...for this week.&amp;lt;/del&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;del&amp;gt;Meaning maybe no Bitcoin crash below $30K this week either.&amp;lt;/del&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;del&amp;gt;In fact, the spike in Bitcoin could potentially create a short squeeze, and we could see prices above $40K this week.&amp;lt;/del&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;del&amp;gt;But we are not quiet out of the woods yet:&amp;lt;/del&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;del&amp;gt;We still have the press meeting....so don&amp;amp;#39;t pull out the party hats yet.&amp;lt;/del&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;del&amp;gt;We still need to hear how dovish or hawkish JPow might sound, and we haven&amp;amp;#39;t heard about timelines.&amp;lt;/del&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Basically the government is about to pass this “America Competes” bill under the guise of staying competitive against China. It’s a load of crap. The bill sneaks in a part where the secretary of Treasury (Janet Yellen) will have full control to just ban assets at will.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That means she can ban ALL of crypto or just certain ones in particular. She can wake up and say hey no more ETH trading in America. Exchanges will have to comply. This is serious.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I normally don’t post because I’m not good with all the formatting and pretty pictures but this is so fucking serious guys. Stop with the stupid tribalism, stop acting like children.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When you follow the money guess who’s lobbying so hard for this to pass? Ding ding ding : the Goldman Sachs Mafia. Banks are finally trying to put the nail in the coffin for crypto. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TLDR: stop bickering for one moment and pay attention to this BS legislation that’s about to change crypto. Also fuck off and read my shit, it’s like 10 sentences.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Included in the America COMPETES Act just introduced in the House, and which will very likely pass in some form, is a provision that would be disastrous not just for bitcoin but for privacy and due process generally. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/yd6ndzcdr2e81.png?width=680&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=9f30615c6ce3bb070f5d57d6b9c1e70591efdde1&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/yd6ndzcdr2e81.png?width=680&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=9f30615c6ce3bb070f5d57d6b9c1e70591efdde1&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The so-called &amp;amp;quot;special measures&amp;amp;quot; provision would essentially give the Treasury Secretary unchecked and unilateral power to ban exchanges and other financial institutions from engaging in cryptocurrency transactions. How would it do this? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/oe75dflgr2e81.png?width=900&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=fc361154d9da4c892574720e50f0dc4368375cc0&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/oe75dflgr2e81.png?width=900&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=fc361154d9da4c892574720e50f0dc4368375cc0&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bank Secrecy Act §5318A allows the Secretary to identify a &amp;amp;quot;primary money laundering concern&amp;amp;quot; and take &amp;amp;quot;special measures&amp;amp;quot; to (1) require financial institutions to report information on the concern, and/or (2) prohibit FIs from maintaining accounts related to the concern. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Special measures&amp;amp;quot; authority is vast power that the Secretary of the Treasury has today, so in the current statute there are checks on that power. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;First, the law requires that Treasury engage in a public rulemaking before instituting a prohibition. Second, the secretary can impose a surveillance special measure through a simple order, but its duration is limited to 120 days and must be accompanied by a public rulemaking. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While not full due process, these limitations at least alert the public and gives the public some opportunity to comment on a special measure&amp;amp;#39;s merit or constitutionality. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The new provision would do three things:  -Add &amp;amp;quot;certain transmittal of funds&amp;amp;quot; to the list of things that can be banned by the Secretary  -Eliminate all public notice and comment requirements  -Eliminate the 120-day limitation for measures imposed without regulation &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/xhvownvlr2e81.jpg?width=583&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=a2e0bc4cc2f6777391e35e447099fc21d8a8c1b7&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/xhvownvlr2e81.jpg?width=583&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=a2e0bc4cc2f6777391e35e447099fc21d8a8c1b7&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If adopted into law, this provision would be disaster not just for crypto but for privacy and democratic public process related to *all* types of financial transactions. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It empowers the Secretary to prohibit any (or indeed all) cryptocurrency transactions (or any other kind of transaction) without any process, rulemaking, or limitation on the duration of the prohibition. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This provision was first introduced as an amendment to the national Defense Authorization Act last year  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/n8eg358pr2e81.png?width=680&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=08418895f5e69fd1104c27b73c7a0e003b87a01d&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/n8eg358pr2e81.png?width=680&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=08418895f5e69fd1104c27b73c7a0e003b87a01d&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After alerting folks in the House and Senate of that amendment&amp;amp;#39;s unintended consequences, it was removed from the final bill that passed. Unfortunately it&amp;amp;#39;s back verbatim without any improvements. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It still strips out *all* administrative process and duration limitations on the Secretary’s power to condition or prohibit transactions at financial institutions associated with primary money laundering concerns. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s time to call your member of Congress and ask that they take action to make sure that notice and comment and duration limitations are not removed from 31 U.S.C. § 5318A as the America COMPETES Act would do.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Do we need to have a computer science background ? Not at all.So i&amp;amp;#39;ve decided to create a step-by-step guide on how to read crypto whitepapers being an average crypto investors.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;First off, you&amp;amp;#39;ll need to know a few basic crypto concepts - if you don&amp;amp;#39;t, learn about them first, which are:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Blockchain&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Consensus mechanism

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Proof of Work&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Proof of Stake&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Nodes&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Mempool&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Soft-fork and hard-fork&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Governance&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Smart contracts&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Byzantine general problem

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault&quot;&amp;gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you know what all of these concepts are, we shall proceed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m going to link in here a few good whitepapers that you guys can check to get an example of how a whitepaper is supposed to be:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf&quot;&amp;gt;https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://solana.com/solana-whitepaper.pdf&quot;&amp;gt;https://solana.com/solana-whitepaper.pdf&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://whitepaper.io/document/581/cardano-whitepaper&quot;&amp;gt;https://whitepaper.io/document/581/cardano-whitepaper&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://whitepaper.io/document/587/terra-whitepaper&quot;&amp;gt;https://whitepaper.io/document/587/terra-whitepaper&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://whitepaper.io/document/582/cosmos-whitepaper&quot;&amp;gt;https://whitepaper.io/document/582/cosmos-whitepaper&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://whitepaper.io/document/1/ripple-whitepaper&quot;&amp;gt;https://whitepaper.io/document/1/ripple-whitepaper&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;*I must say that there are bad projects with good whitepapers. I&amp;amp;#39;m not shilling any of these blockchains. I solely listed their whitepapers because they are well-written and solid.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;*As you may notice. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://whitepaper.io&quot;&amp;gt;whitepaper.io&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; is a good source to research them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now, let me present a small step-by-step guide to analyze whitepapers! I&amp;amp;#39;m also going to be posting screenshots of the bitcoin whitepaper as examples.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;1) Why the project was created ?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Basic starting point. What is the motivation behind the creation ? What problem does it aim to solve ? How different is it from our current solutions ?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/xeuoij5x3zd81.png?width=532&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=67b69cff191f3786122db47291ab87a9706abf49&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/xeuoij5x3zd81.png?width=532&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=67b69cff191f3786122db47291ab87a9706abf49&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;2) What real world utility does it have ?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Nowadays there are a bunch of crypto projects that are a solution looking for a problem. Not everything is supposed to be in the blockchain, guys. Not everything will benefit for being in the blockchain.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/7na6llmy3zd81.png?width=534&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=fadfc64d72a6f84fd8859572b20ccff37bb458e3&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/7na6llmy3zd81.png?width=534&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=fadfc64d72a6f84fd8859572b20ccff37bb458e3&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;3) How does it achieve consensus in the network ?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is a very important point. Its not just about being proof-of-stake, proof-of-work, proof-of-whatever. To achieve consensus means solving the byzantine general problem somehow - it means how the different nodes on a network enter in a consensus if a transaction is true or false without direct communicating with each other. That&amp;amp;#39;s what make it possible to create decentralization.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/oz5ignnz3zd81.png?width=433&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=db477d007345b9c4ee349c6a8eaa9b1dbbc89a66&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/oz5ignnz3zd81.png?width=433&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=db477d007345b9c4ee349c6a8eaa9b1dbbc89a66&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;4) How was the initial coins distributed ?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In bitcoin, obviously there was no pre-mined coins. The first coin ever mined was by Satoshi Nakamoto himself. But on some blockchains, there are initial tokens distributions through pre-mined coins, specially in proof-of-stake ones. It doesn&amp;amp;#39;t make it bad, it&amp;amp;#39;s just different and you should look for it in the whitepaper or other sources. I would consider anything over 10% to devs/venture capitalists a bad project.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/5lo0pes14zd81.png?width=545&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=faf2b28046b9c352d9dab01cce97f41260a64105&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/5lo0pes14zd81.png?width=545&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=faf2b28046b9c352d9dab01cce97f41260a64105&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;5) How does it actually work ?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Many whitepapers are going to have a simplificed mechanism of how the network actually functions, like a summary/graph. If not, you can usually understand it just by reading it. You don&amp;amp;#39;t need to udnerstand everything and all the technicalities, just the main picture - just like it is in the bitcoin whitepaper.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/otq2pyl24zd81.png?width=535&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=bda6e9cb4a880ea6de040839e1fb3b9a3d572a62&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/otq2pyl24zd81.png?width=535&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=bda6e9cb4a880ea6de040839e1fb3b9a3d572a62&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;6) What are the potential weaknesses of the network and how they are adressed ?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Not all whitepapers are going to have this one, but I highly value when its present, since it shows that the devs are actually worried about the network security and not only interested in marketing/profit.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/cwzo8wd34zd81.png?width=541&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=5ea3f4fbe6d42d27302b1e066a18a29fd507c05d&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/cwzo8wd34zd81.png?width=541&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=5ea3f4fbe6d42d27302b1e066a18a29fd507c05d&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;7) Does it have some math stuff you don&amp;amp;#39;t understand ?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Great, now you can ask around at reddit/telegram/etc if this stuff is legit to people that actually understand it! No need to stress over it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/05tdubk44zd81.png?width=451&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=6df05caca93e55cf569d1a34b3e08c93822dacdd&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/05tdubk44zd81.png?width=451&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=6df05caca93e55cf569d1a34b3e08c93822dacdd&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;And that&amp;amp;#39;s it!&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; That&amp;amp;#39;s basically the main things you should be looking for in the whitepaper. Of course, there are going to be &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;much more&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; to read and analyze - this is definitely an oversimplification, only meant to work as a starting point.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I must say that there&amp;amp;#39;s so many more important things that aren&amp;amp;#39;t exactly in the whitepaper most of the time. It&amp;amp;#39;s extremely important to consider, for instance, the tokenomics and the background of the dev team, amongst other things.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;*Sorry for any english mistakes, it&amp;amp;#39;s not my first language.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

This Bill on the surface seeks to make US more competitive against China. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But hidden deep in its 2900 pages, this Bill contains provisions that give the Treasury unlimited powers to prohibit and block crypto exchanges. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Currently, the Treasury cannot take unilateral decisions to block crypto transactions without a formal notice and a public process, and give a 120 day period to challenge any decision. However, under the new Bill, the Treasury can take decisions without any formal process, based solely on its own apprehensions. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The new bill allows the Treasury headed by Yellen to block transmission of funds if the Treasury deems so. It can quickly order blocking any transaction or exchange without any review process or administrative controls. This gives the Treasury unchecked control over all crypto exchanges and transactions. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This language was already included in a bill from last year, however there was opposition and it was removed. However yet again this has been sneaked into a must pass bill. The very idea of sneaking in such clauses in 2900 pages of incomprehensible regulations stinks. How are even the legislators going to read any of this? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The new bill: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://rules.house.gov/sites/democrats.rules.house.gov/files/BILLS-117HR4521RH-RCP117-31.pdf&quot;&amp;gt;https://rules.house.gov/sites/democrats.rules.house.gov/files/BILLS-117HR4521RH-RCP117-31.pdf&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But the fact is that just 2% of their reserves are even allocated in BTC. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://bitcointreasuries.net/&quot;&amp;gt;El Salvador holds around $70m worth BTC&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. This is literally nothing for a country. They hold 1691 BTC, in comparison , Microstrategy and Tesla hold over 120,000 BTC  and 40,000 BTC respectively. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FI.RES.TOTL.CD?locations=SV&quot;&amp;gt;El Salvador&amp;amp;#39;s total foreign exchange reserves is pegged at $3.3 BN&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://tradingeconomics.com/el-salvador/foreign-exchange-reserves&quot;&amp;gt;https://tradingeconomics.com/el-salvador/foreign-exchange-reserves&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Less than 2% of their reserves are in BTC.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/bitcoin/bukele-reveals-el-salvadors-gold-reserves-and-benefits-of-bitcoin-over-gold/articleshow/88142021.cms&quot;&amp;gt;El Salvador holds more in GOLD than in BTC&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;According to this article, they hold $79m worth GOLD, but just $70m 
worth BTC. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;People are spreading the false narrative as if he has moved the entire supply of reserves to BTC, which is far away from whats going on.
They have just been making small purchases over time. They literally bought like 2 BTC in the end of Dec. Peanuts for a country.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A 2% allocation in a risky asset class is not a gamble by any means. It is a decent risk reward play for individuals, and countries as well. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you consult with a financial advisor, they may suggest a portfolio allocation of 2% towards emerging asset classes like crypto. Infact, thats what Fidelity suggests as well. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investmentexecutive.com/news/products/fidelity-to-add-bitcoin-exposure-to-portfolio-funds/&quot;&amp;gt;Recently, they added a 2% BTC allocation to their flagship All in one Balanced / Growth funds&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. These are mom and pop funds that are held mostly by conservative investors. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Its been around a year since El Salvador announced their Bitcoin Law and around 6 months since it went active. In this period, they have allocated a small portion of their reserves towards BTC. This is not a gamble, but a solid  and well planned asset allocation strategy. Meanwhile, they have already started mining BTC and over time, this industry has the potential to add to their GDP. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What did people think bitcoin/crypto adoption would be like, one fine day every country across the world will just start accepting BTC out of the blue? Just like that it would become legal tender without any struggle? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These are small steps and it will be risky. Nothing happened overnight, let alone moving from USD to a decentralised currency like Bitcoin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Its shameful that people here want adoption of BTC and crypto, but the first time a large sovereign power has tried to adopt BTC, the same people who want crypto adoption go out of their way to attack them with baseless allegations. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Muhh adoption should be in accordance with my terms, otherwise its not adoption. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These people are just privileged bottom feeders who want to enjoy success without any risks whatsoever.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s disgusting how she basically admits that Corporate money and influence dictate everything. Walmart, Amazon, and other large corporations fund social welfare programs that their workers use in order to deprive them of a living wage and healthcare. Cryptocurrency allows us to break free of this financial bondage and turns the whole system on it&amp;amp;#39;s head.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Truly decentralized cryptocurrency has the potential to revolutionize everything. It can allow for everyone&amp;amp;#39;s vote to matter and have input on the changes society needs. It can allow for efficient and transparent tax allocation so anyone and everyone can audit and keep the system accountable to the people.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Trustless and public block chains are the only way I see to get dark corporate money out of politics.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto isn&amp;amp;#39;t just some novel niche tech, it has the potential to be the catalyst for economic and political revolution. If we can successfully integrate a truly decentralized financial protocol, it changes the dynamics of rich nations to poor nations, rich people to poor people.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I really hope humanity can use cryptocurrency to better society and eliminate the asymmetry&amp;amp;#39;s of power that Corporations, and people like Janet Yellen abuse.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Nayib Bukele chose Bitcoin to try to change the future of his country. Under the current system, El Salvador was condemned to survive by begging for aid from the IMF or the World Bank.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Nayib Bukele understood the why of Bitcoin and decided to seize this opportunity to change the future of El Salvador and its people. The people of El Salvador overwhelmingly support Nayib Bukele in what he is trying to do for the country.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;El Salvador&amp;amp;#39;s bold choice has already changed the way the country is seen around the world. Everyone is talking about El Salvador and more and more entrepreneurs will be coming to El Salvador to participate in this experiment of building the first Bitcoin Nation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Who knew where El Salvador was before Nayib Bukele made this choice? Very few people. No one was talking about El Salvador. Bitcoin is already a game-changer for El Salvador and this is clearly just the beginning.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While the IMF or the World Bank scoffed at Bitcoin a few years ago, now these institutions are getting scared by the growing possibility that the Bitcoin experiment will succeed in El Salvador and motivate other countries to follow Nayib Bukele&amp;amp;#39;s path.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Tonga is talking about adopting Bitcoin by the end of 2022, as are other countries in South and Central America. In short, something is happening and the IMF feels the danger mounting for its obsolete system.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Rather than letting the people determine for themselves, the IMF is threatening El Salvador saying the country must abandon Bitcoin. The IMF&amp;amp;#39;s threats only justify, in my opinion, the very existence of Bitcoin and the absolute necessity for the world to have this alternative system available.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Since El Salvador will logically refuse to obey the IMF, what&amp;amp;#39;s next? Will America eventually orchestrate a coup in El Salvador to overthrow the government and end the Bitcoin experiment? How far are the powerful people in the current system willing to go to prevent countries from expressing their free will in monetary and financial matters?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;El Salvador must continue to resist outside pressure, and other countries that will join the Bitcoin adventure in 2022 must do the same. The world is changing, and the first countries to adopt Bitcoin will be the ones to benefit the most in the future.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

When it comes to value, they probably didn&amp;amp;#39;t understand the ecosystem and use cases of (not shitcoins) crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For someone like me, I did a lot of trading and utilized a lot of different exchanges and wallets (which of course wasn’t a good idea).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I also use a coin tracker and records to keep track of my gains and losses. I started with &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://koinly.io/?r=1&quot;&amp;gt;Koinly&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, but because I didn&amp;amp;#39;t want to pay for the tax reports, I switched to &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://crypto.com/?r=1&quot;&amp;gt;Crypto.com&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and their tax tool. I experienced the same problem with both of them. I then discovered that &amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://cryptotaxcalculator.io/?r=1&quot;&amp;gt;CryptoTaxCalculator&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; was a lot more accurate at recognizing transactions than Koinly.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But seriously though, this just makes government bankers and politicians hypocrites if they make people pay taxes on crypto if they consider it a useless asset and that they&amp;amp;#39;ll receive a part of their paycheck from taxes collected from crypto. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To have intrinsic value, something does not have to be a &amp;amp;quot;physical asset&amp;amp;quot; like gold or have &amp;amp;quot;official&amp;amp;quot; government support or acknowledgment. From a philosophical and practical standpoint, the whole argument that it has no intrinsic worth is a ridiculous slippery slope.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I tried stocks for around 4 years and it never really felt something native to my generation (Gen Z). Overall I believe in crypto more, but I recognize the risks involved with it as I&amp;amp;#39;ve been dabbling in them since 2017.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;ve been looking into stablecoins and generating passive yields with these, but I want to find something which has some form of insurance or low risk of the money suddenly disappearing due to a hack or similar. Basically, I want to be sure that my inheritance money won&amp;amp;#39;t disappear within the next 3-5 years minimum, and ideally, I want to be able to take out a portion of the yield to live off of.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I do own a hardware wallet so I would be ok with storing the funds there. I found a stablecoin called OUSD, which seems to cover my needs together with an added 3rd party insurance, but the protocol does not seem to be that known and has USDT exposure, which is why I am a little bit hesitant as of right now. I&amp;amp;#39;m happy to hear if anyone has positive experience with it though. I am also happy to hear if anyone has other recommendations on what you would do with $200k to create a yield to live off of.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I am based in Europe (in case there are any CEX recommendations that only have US-specific insurances).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: People are telling me to be careful with DMs, funnily enough it did indeed blow up but I&amp;amp;#39;ve been in the game long enough to know not to click anything, thanks everyone!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I start edging in, just in case it goes lower to protect me from volatility. I set up buy orders:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;$1,000 at 34k&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;$2,000 at 32k&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;$3,000 at 30k&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;$4,000 at 28k&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This isn&amp;amp;#39;t perfect, but it has protected me from volatility a bit and certainly stopped me from dropping all my money on a coin at a higher price.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: Some people are saying this is DCAing. Dollar Cost Averaging is investing money at certain intervals regardless of the price. For my example it would be like $1000 a month over the next 10 months&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
