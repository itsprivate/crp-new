I just happened to be in crypto market since 2013.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Before we dive into the why of the message above, here are the kind of things everyone needs to be EXTREMELY CAREFUL about:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A lot of YouTube scammers and spammers are going to tout &amp;amp;quot;buy the dip&amp;amp;quot;, &amp;amp;quot;capitulation&amp;amp;quot;, &amp;amp;quot;steal deals&amp;amp;quot; and so on - do not fall for it. Doing your own research is more important than ever&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Doing your own research wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t do much in this environment - markets are in a tricky situation, globally, a very bad one.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Many projects will see MASSIVE corrections and many would not survive so be even more careful.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So, with that aside, let&amp;amp;#39;s dive in a bit more.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A significant downside risk still persists in the market and if (god forbid) another 1-2 bad news hit the market, we may end up seeing that downside - it may mean a &amp;amp;lt;$10K BTC and &amp;amp;lt;$1K ETH. Terra is already down 90% with its own bad news and market will not be nice to any assets if bad news keep hitting. Right now, likelihood of bad news is more than the good news. Russia-Ukraine situation can escalate beyond the two countries, China real estate is a ticking bomb, China lockdown may extend further, another major covid variant can set things really back etc.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The V-shape recovery from this crash is highly unlikely, no major stimulus plan is waiting this market crash at the end of the tunnel, this market crash is good for the government because it will tame down the inflation. So don&amp;amp;#39;t try to outsmart the market with short term trades.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All in all, don&amp;amp;#39;t fall for shitty and shady YouTubers and Crypto influencers on Twitter - nobody understands the market and macro signals are more geared towards downside risk than upside optimism.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;BE EXTREMELY CAUTIOUS IN EXECUTING ANY TRADE!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Good news - this shall pass too and we will emerge stronger with a bigger crypto market (shooting to $5-10T) but have patience and wait and watch.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;God bless us all!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It seems like the classic case of the hare and the tortoise. Lightning was proposed 7 years ago and has slowly but surely plodded along. Meanwhile in the alt coin space you had these L2 tokens popping up like flies these past year. Rushing out something barely even decentralised just to get rich off their token floating around in the space. But now Lightning has shown how nonsense these all are. Why do they need their own token to perform scaling solutions&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Right now, I&amp;amp;#39;m looking forward to seeing how crowdloan works. When I read &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://bitcoinist.com/web3-foundation-and-zondax-bring-ledger-apps-to-polkadot-parachains/&quot;&amp;gt;this&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, I became even more excited because it seemed to be a fantastic opportunity to join in many projects. Polkadot continues to roll out of the parachains, giving people the opportunity to earn a ton of free tokens. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;XCM will soon rollout allowing parachains to communicate with one another and secure token transfers between chains, among other things. On the existing parachains that have won a slot, projects are presently being built and launched.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These are just some random thoughts and I believe there is much more to come.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/wny63lj62ry81.png?width=1789&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e8222f0ca93d62aa793f7d5a2164437c0e2ff619&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/wny63lj62ry81.png?width=1789&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e8222f0ca93d62aa793f7d5a2164437c0e2ff619&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That being said, there is a glaring change of pattern between the previous bear market, against the current bear market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;table&amp;gt;&amp;lt;thead&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;th align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;Year&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;th align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;2013 - 2015&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;th align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;2018-2020&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;th align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;2022-2024 (?)&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/thead&amp;gt;&amp;lt;tbody&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;Peak Price&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;USD 1,149.14&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;USD 19,970&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;USD 69,050&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;Bear Market Low&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;USD 197.24&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;USD 3,109&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;USD 28,000-29,000 (?)&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;Drawdown&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;-83%&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;-84%&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;-58% (For now)&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/tbody&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/table&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Realistically, BTC does not go lower than its previous ATH, according to previous patterns. So, we probably won&amp;amp;#39;t see BTC going down below USD 19,970. This is why this current bear market is interesting. We are seeing possibly a &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;lowering in the drawdown&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The bear market is getting more and more bearable. Pun intended.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That being said, if you had entered into crypto this year, then the next point of exit should be by the next halving in 2024/2025. Although the current halving hasn&amp;amp;#39;t met the expectations yet, the previous halving would suggest that the metrics is rather promising. If you&amp;amp;#39;re concerned about the stock-to-flow model not meeting the prediction this time, consider that BTC had exceeded the stock-to-flow prices previously as well. It will eventually balances out.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However, you do need to pay additional considerations if you&amp;amp;#39;re jumping into alts.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In contrast the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yahoo.com/now/three-reasons-behind-crypto-market-035440154.html&quot;&amp;gt;crypto market has lost 130 Billion&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yet you see all these articles about how crypto is dying and BTC  has crashed, dont fall for that crap. There are coins and projects that have and will fail, that is no doubt, some are just stupid. But the fundamentals and the concept of crypto is firm and secure. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The technology of ledgers and blockchains is here to stay, how a project or coin uses or misuses it is not proof that the technology is bad. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So look at crypto as an industry and technology not as just the coin or the market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I can’t believe how many people are, lack of a better word, brainwashed. I feel like it has been proven that the developers are engaging in shady practices and not ethical. I am thinking they will take that money and run at some point. Why do you think people are so adamant that it’s a legitimate project? The “CEO” reeks of charlatan. Also, I believe they incorporated a 90% claim tax or something like that to where it’s hard to take money out (not sure if that’s accurate). I am not a skeptical person but my God I just don’t get it. I truly feel bad for the investors because from the outside it seems crazy that someone would fall for some of the explanations heard from the Safemoon team regarding certain accusations. Anyway,  was curious to hear everyone’s thoughts. I’m obviously not an investor in the project and just trying to understand peoples mentality when it comes to projects like this. Appreciate some insight. Fascinating stuff. Cheers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: first of all I want to say that I appreciate all of the comments. I have learned several things so far. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt; I am wrong about the 90% claim tax and I guess it is 100% transfer tax which seems much better. (Please someone clean me up on this if I’m still wrong)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt; I am apparently a karma whore. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The Safemoon army is a passionate bunch. I can appreciate that. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;People that post about Safemoon just want the moons. I was not aware of this. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;There are people that have invested who understood that it was a longshot and invested only what they were willing to lose or made a little money early and got out. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Lots of bots in the Safemoon subreddit.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

It had the most explosive start of any coin I&amp;amp;#39;ve ever seen. It entered the top 10 immediately, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20210511041514/https://coinmarketcap.com/&quot;&amp;gt;even went to #4&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; for a few hours, with only BTC, ETH and BNB ahead of it. On the first day it was even listed on sites like Coingecko and Coinmarketcap! I remember thinking this was a bug when there suddenly was a new coin in the top 10.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Today, it is sitting solidly below $15, even went below $10 yesterday - what happened? Well, $700 was just absurdly overpriced, it seems. But to be fair, ICP has had incredibly bad luck with its timing, as it was released just days before Bitcoin&amp;amp;#39;s biggest crash in recent history, which dragged the whole market down with it. On May 10, BTC opened at &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;above $58&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, only 3 days later it opened below $50k and kept going down, to a low of  &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$30,681.50&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; on May 19.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;ICP was hit too, but much harder - I would guess it would have gone down from $700 even in a good market. There was quite a bit of up and down in the first few days, but it (at least temporarily, respectively) went below $400 on May 11, below $300 on May 12, below $200 on May 17 and below $100 on May 19. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;That&amp;amp;#39;s $700 to below $100 in nine days.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; There were a few ups and downs in the following days but it permanently went below $100 on June 8, less than a month after its release, and never returned.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You know what&amp;amp;#39;s impressive, though? You would expect a coin that has fallen more than 98% to be at like rank 300 or something at best. But nope, it is still sitting somewhere around #40 - &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;that&amp;amp;#39;s how absurdly high its market cap was!&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Happy birthday ICP, I&amp;amp;#39;m curios where you&amp;amp;#39;ll be in a year!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I mean, I haven&amp;amp;#39;t seen a suicide hotline posts stickied in months now. Some people argue that the fear and greed index (currently at 10) is the right way to go, and normally I agree, but I don&amp;amp;#39;t think this is a normal situation. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;History shows us (as far as BTC is concerned), bear market bring a 80% dump to BTC. Sure, sure, now we have a lot of institutional investors involved, who won&amp;amp;#39;t allow BTC to go down THAT much. And we&amp;amp;#39;re currently 50ish% down from BTC ATH. I was also under the impression that &amp;amp;quot;this time it&amp;amp;#39;s different&amp;amp;quot; and that BTC drops of around 80% are not as likely. But this is the first time BTC is around in a situation where we have a major global recession. Which is just now starting to show it&amp;amp;#39;s ugly teeth. So if you&amp;amp;#39;re thinking this is the bottom, you have another thing coming. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Don&amp;amp;#39;t make the mistake in thinking things will get easier over the next few weeks. It is highly likely that people will lose jobs. People will lose homes. We are still in a completely unregulated market. BTC and crypto will dump a lot more from this point. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you have a DCA strategy (and available FIAT now), sure, continue to buy weekly/monthly. Nothing wrong with this strategy. It is historically proven this is the best strategy which minimizes risk and general emotional connection with how your portfolio is doing on a daily basis. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But I&amp;amp;#39;m waiting. I have my buy orders set at $22k (around 65% down from ATH) and all the way down to $11k (a bit over 80% down).

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;People telling you to buy now or you&amp;amp;#39;ll regret it later are essentially just telling you to FOMO in. 100% of the people saying it have likely just FOMOed in themselves, and now want you to FOMO in as well to increase their investment. Don&amp;amp;#39;t listen to people here. Stick to your own investment plan and ignore the calls to FOMO in now from strangers on Reddit. Prices may very well go back up quickly and you missed your chance to buy cheap crypto, but they could just as well keep falling below the next support and you&amp;amp;#39;ve just FOMOed into comparatively expensive crypto. Have your own investment plan and stick to it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;TL;DR:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; The people here don&amp;amp;#39;t know anything. They just pretend they do. Have your own investment plan and stick to it. Ignore the people telling you to FOMO in on Reddit.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

People may seem negative about crypto now, but I think most of us would agree that we are still bullish on crypto in general for the mid to long term future.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While this is not the worst time to buy, there will probably be a years long period relatively soon where the sentiment around crypto is that it is dead and will legitimately never recover.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It wont just be normal people saying this, that will be the sentiment on this sub for many as well. You yourself will start to wonder if crypto can recover, and will probably start to think that crypto could actually just be dead. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As strange as it may seem now, it will be really really difficult to convince yourself to buy at that point. While the prices will be incredibly low, the overall sentiment will be that crypto will never see ATH ever again, and you won&amp;amp;#39;t want to buy.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That will be the best time to buy, as it has been in the past, and we aren’t close to that point yet. We still have many more months, maybe even a year or more before that point. A good barometer for the bottom will be when you yourself start to think that crypto could be dead and will not recover. Those who have the conviction to buy at that point will make out the best in the next bull run, just like they have in the past.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I remember seeing a lot of people suggest the next best stablecoin to invest in was the UST because of anchor and 19.5% apy. I know a lot of people that ended up switching over to this since it seemed the new best thing. Not even 2 weeks later this disaster happens and a stablecoin drops 30% with fears it won&amp;amp;#39;t be able to re-peg back to $1.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It must suck getting screwed over by cdc then going to anchor only to get screwed again 2 weeks later. My condolences 🙏 to you all. I know I almost was going to move my stablecoin stack over but knew 19.5% was not sustainable for long if everywhere was slashing rates so decided against it and just went to voyager and kept it in USDC.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At this point it&amp;amp;#39;s a question of - &amp;amp;quot;will the bleeding stop&amp;amp;quot; or will UST/Terra Rug itself out of existence?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Two months ago &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/u/cwm9&quot;&amp;gt;/u/cwm9&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; made a very detailed post about his concerns with UST. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/tbcrkh/explain_to_me_how_terraluna_is_not_a_scam/?context=3&quot;&amp;gt;Which outlined a scenario exactly like this.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But go the other way: when people start selling their UST because they want to go back to bitcoin, they mint Luna and sell it. Now the price of Luna goes down. The fact that the price is going down and total coins minted is rising encourages the selling of Luna making the price drop farther. If the price drops too far, it can no longer support the burning of UST to get a dollar by selling Luna.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The response from Reddit was - well yah that&amp;amp;#39;s supply/demand + Terra is a lot more than UST there is a whole ecosystem.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Additionally Terra began buying BTC reserves and had over $1B in reserves to prepare for this scenario.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At this point the question isn&amp;amp;#39;t will the peg break? The BTC reserves of $1B are likely all gone and nothing is probably left. Nearly 3B in volume in the last 24 hours. The question is, is this the end of Terra?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Even if this is the lowest purchase so far, it&amp;amp;#39;s already gone down:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitcoin current price is $30,642. El Saldavor&amp;amp;#39;s DCA average is $45,908.42.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And looks like the experiment hasn&amp;amp;#39;t gone well lately. A study by a U.S.-based think tank, the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), said only 20% of Salvadorans have continued to use the nationally issued and technically flawed digital wallet needed to spend bitcoin. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I bought at $50 in 2011 on a long gone exchange, and immediately Bitcoin fell to $12. I felt stupid. So in defiance, I promised myself I wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t sell until it reached an impossibly high number.  1000x. But $50k came and I couldn&amp;amp;#39;t bear to sell. I love this journey too much. And I see now that my crazy goal was way too low. My vision for Bitcoin was too small. 
Now I need a 10000x return. When that day comes, I want this post here so I can rub it in the faces of the zero-coiners who were here in 2022 and who, even when offered Bitcoin at a huge discount, refused to buy in. You&amp;amp;#39;ll never buy. You don&amp;amp;#39;t have the vision or stamina to not only acquire Bitcoin, but to keep your Bitcoin.
Go the fuck away. You make &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/bitcoin&quot;&amp;gt;/r/bitcoin&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; suck.
But please come back the day Bitcoin kisses $500k. I&amp;amp;#39;ll have a message for you on that day.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is insane and very scary. I don’t wanna spread FUD and definitely don’t use this as financial advice but everybody should be aware especially holding LUNA,UST or BTC trades.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I personally doubt they would just sell their entire holdings and abandon their project. But it’s still an odd move in the middle of a big dip.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I obviously don’t want to see anyone or anything fail, but it really is important to read everything with an open heart. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you straight up ignore all advice that is contrary to what you want to hear, you are setting yourself up for failure. The Safemoon sub is the prime example of the echo chamber that just won’t listen. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Please. If someone warns you against something, try to find reason in it. Is it possible they are correct? Challenge it, and ask or clarify your misunderstandings. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I don’t want this post to come across as a “told you so” at all. Although I’m sure many commenters will say exactly that. The point I’m trying to make is to please listen to both sides at all times. It is usually quite easy to discern between someone just spreading FUD and someone who is trying to challenge the merits of a project. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One thing I do to help me understand all issues is to join the subs or projects I’m not involved in, as well as those I am involved in. I need to hear all sides.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Second of all, we ARE in a bear market. And I am not talking about the last few weeks. Crypto is on a steady decline for &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;7 MONTHS&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, and people want to still argue that this isn&amp;amp;#39;t a bear market?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;By definition, a bull market occurs when securities are on the rise, while a bear market occurs when securities &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;fall for a sustained period of time&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. If 210 days of steady decline isn&amp;amp;#39;t a sustained period of time, I don&amp;amp;#39;t know what is.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Personally, I haven&amp;amp;#39;t invested in the last few months for various reasons. The main one was that all altcoins were -70% down from ATH, while BTC was still at 40k. Now tell me what would happen if BTC reached 28k like it did last year? Altcoins would be most likely down -85%.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The rate hike, inflation, the Ukraine war and the stock market being in a bubble for almost 2 years now are just some other reasons.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So when will bull market start again in my opinion? Sadly, I believe it will happen only after a market crash. There will be a nice reset, investing going back to normal and people buying the dips, potentially war being over or even getting inflation under control. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Currently, no investor will ever go all-in with their money if there are so many risk factors.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They just transferred all their BTC out of their wallet, probably going to dump it on the market in order to try to save UST.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Good luck to everyone who put money in UST. It will probably recover this time around because they got the BTC to sell or lend, but this just proves that UST isn&amp;amp;#39;t the great stablecoin that this sub portraits it at.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Be careful with UST going forward, this definitely won&amp;amp;#39;t be the last time that it&amp;amp;#39;s briefly losing it&amp;amp;#39;s peg and one day it might not recover.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Stop listening to these influencer they can&amp;amp;#39;t tell you where the bottom or top is. Stick to your plan, DCA during these crashes because if you are in for long term these prices won&amp;amp;#39;t bother you at all.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In May 2021, we dipped to $28k and made ATH within 6 months I don&amp;amp;#39;t say we are going to make another ATH in next 6 months this might be a years long bear market who knows. People were calling May 2021 a bear market too we still made ATH in months. Stick to your plan and DCA.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Lets just look at the bloodbath right now&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/ky9skqra7hy81.png?width=1616&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=feb5d44fd0a0903353c467b27d7a6a7bd51caa54&quot;&amp;gt;The market right now&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;BTC - ATH is $68,789.63 and the current price is 33,279$. When we reachieve ATH, that will be over 100% increase. Which means you are doubling the money that you are putting in by buying now.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Similarly with ETH. ATH is $4,891.70 and the current price is 2,413$. Again when we reach ATH, you are looking at a 2x of what you have invested.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But those of you who have money but haven&amp;amp;#39;t bought BTC at this price, in the hopes that&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The price will go even lower. That is Greed. You aren’t even taking this opportunity now to get a 2x, then trust me, every time it goes lower, you will wait for a new low. And when prices rebound, you will still wait for the “crash” only to finally fomo near the top.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The market is too volatile, I might lose my money. Well, this is crypto. You should invest what you can afford to remove maybe a year or two later. Don’t imagine Bitcoin to make you a millionaire overnight. But if you invest too much, it can make you broke in no time as well.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The potential of BTC is over. I need to find the next 1000x ultra micro cap coin. Well if you are colorblind, the market is red now. Good luck finding an alt coin that statistically might not survive the bear market.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TLDR - Agreed that crypto is volatile as hell. But within this space, the most safest and blue chip investment are at prices which will net you double the returns.  What is stopping you from investing at least a portion of your investment money now ?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
