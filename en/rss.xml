&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They&amp;amp;#39;ve since DCA&amp;amp;#39;d back into the market (with $533m) and are now $718m in profit ($1.2b total). It helps that they have half a billion in scratch to throw around, but they still have the huevos to take the L and come back in. I expect they&amp;amp;#39;re going to be a HODLer going forward as they haven&amp;amp;#39;t sold into the recent pullback on price. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yes I am talking about the sudden burst of anger from many of you about how Gavin Wood, head of Polkadot, and Sunny Lu, head of VeChain, have asked for Ukraine to post an address for them to donate. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To be clear... Donate their OWN FUCKING MONEY. Ukraine has asked for donations in any way that they can. Food, ammunition, guns, resources, food and water, fighters, and any assistance possible to fight a much larger force. The only reason they initially posted the addresses to BTC and ETH is because those are the two biggest currencies. They will take whatever funds they can possibly get and that is EXACTLY what these two are doing. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If I hear one more person say, oh well they could have converted it to BTC or ETH first and then sent it... Why should they have to? They have a large portion of their own individual wealth in the coin they created, they should be able to send that to help out and not get ridiculed by internet trolls thousands of miles away. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Not like they would give a shit anyway if you disagree about how they have donated because lets me real, they are trying to make a difference.... What have you done?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Two more things, these are both respected projects! It&amp;amp;#39;s not like someone is asking them to set up a wallet for elonspermshitfuckidontcare coin. These are coins that have a lot of backing and are known. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Leads me into the follow up, now you know what address to send those coins to if you want to donate! Honestly, I hope Ukraine eventually posts address to lots of coins so that countless people can band together and donate what they have in order to help. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We are better than this people, show the world that crypto is united and what we can really do to help. Last time I checked, Ukraine is getting close to 40 million in crypto donations, I hope to see that number reach 100 million and beyond very soon.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyways, ever since the grand slam dump of a fall from what was an astonishing number for a coin like doge, It has been in a constant downtrend ever since. Now currently at $0.122 from it&amp;amp;#39;s ath of $0.68, thats a fall of nearly 70%!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/kadgk0cpelk81.png?width=891&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=15f4b2d6d0c637c624ea0a2c22859b6dea2952b7&quot;&amp;gt;Consistent downtrend (1D chart)&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There have been minor jumps and pumps along the way, but after every single jump, there&amp;amp;#39;s a even bigger dump. The gap between pumps have been becoming higher and higher, and the duration of the pump has shown to be shortening over time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Is it safe to say the era of not memecoins, but dogecoin in reference is over? I honestly don&amp;amp;#39;t think Elon or anyone for that matter would be able to bring back the hype of dogecoin as it was back in May. I personally know many people who bought at the top and still hold for the &amp;amp;quot;$1 dogecoin!&amp;amp;quot; line. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I although did hold through .07 and saw my investment hit the multi-thousands. I didn&amp;amp;#39;t sell because of that line, my knowledge in cryptocurrency tokenomics has a huge role in my decision making. I&amp;amp;#39;m still baffled that Dogecoin managed to pull off being in Top 3 cryptocurrencies, when you look at it now. That&amp;amp;#39;s crazy!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyways, just wanted to discuss my thoughts. What do you think? I don&amp;amp;#39;t think doge will ever go back up aside from the little pumps it may have, definitely not close to where it was at it&amp;amp;#39;s highest.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

We need convenient, fast and cheap markets for non-KYC bitcoin. I have worked my ass off for two months to create an easy and private P2P exchange that uses solely lightning hold invoices. It is called RoboSats and I believe it can potentially rival centralized exchanges in ease of use and fees, while being totally private and having a close to custody-less pipeline. You can use it from your smartphone right now: it is straightforward to use even for the very noob. The platform is fully open source and will always be. It works quite well, but it is experimental: read the info and trade only small amounts. Open it now with Tor Browser: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://robosats6tkf3eva7x2voqso3a5wcorsnw34jveyxfqi2fu7oyheasid.onion/&quot;&amp;gt;Onion Link&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Background&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One of the main threats for the Bitcoin network and its users is the ability of a few entities to control the fiat on/off-ramps. The tight grip on them allows for censorship and surveillance by linking funds with identities and strips the freedom away from Bitcoin. While there exists several peer-to-peer alternatives to centralized exchanges, these are rather technical, slow and costly. Most users still prefer the convenience of a centralized exchange at the cost of their privacy and a difficult initial setup (submit passport, selfie-video, etc). Things do not look too well for a truly free Bitcoin ecosystem.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However, there are opportunities too. Using the Lightning Network it might very well be possible to create a very user friendly, safe, fast and cheap peer-to-peer market. By using hold invoices as fidelity bonds and trade escrows, trust/security can be maximized. It will never be as secure as an on-chain escrow. But one can dream that an open p2p market like that could rival the ease of use of centralized exchanges and have very low fees too; yet, with minimal privacy invasion and a close to custody-less trade pipeline.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/yvd6dqtpafk81.jpg?width=1200&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=6293fafd6fffffd1b6d792134007e588bdc19dd9&quot;&amp;gt;Wait, is that u/Reckless_Satoshi wearing a hoodie... AGAIN!?. He must have been up to something.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For the last two months I have been locked in my basement, feeding protein shakes and listening to SaylorWaves instead of sleeping... yeah, living the good life. And... I have also built &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;RoboSats&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; during that time :)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;What is RoboSats?&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is a BTC/FIAT peer-to-peer exchange over lightning. It simplifies matchmaking and minimizes the need for trust. RoboSats focuses in privacy, speed and user friendliness. RoboSats is an &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/reckless-satoshi/robosats&quot;&amp;gt;open source project&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;How does it work?&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Alice wants to buy bitcoin privately. She generates an avatar in RoboSats homepage (AnonymousAlice01) and stores her random token safely so she can recover the avatar later. She creates a new buy order. Bob wants to sell bitcoin and takes Alice&amp;amp;#39;s order. Both have to post a small bond using lightning to prove they are &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;real robots&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. Then, Bob posts the trade collateral also using a lightning hold invoice. RoboSats locks the invoice until Bob confirms he received the fiat, then the satoshis are released to Alice. Enjoy your satoshis Alice!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At no point, Alice and Bob have to entrust the bitcoin to each other. In case they have a conflict, RoboSats staff will help resolving the dispute. You can find a step-by-step description of the trade pipeline in &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Reckless-Satoshi/robosats/blob/main/README.md#how-it-works&quot;&amp;gt;How It Works&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Use it now&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Click the link below to start buying/selling non-KYC Bitcoin, no registration or any other BS required. Just visit the site using TOR Browser (Mobile works great). Brave is OK too:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://robosats6tkf3eva7x2voqso3a5wcorsnw34jveyxfqi2fu7oyheasid.onion&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;RoboSats&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;6tkf3eva7x2voqso3a5wcorsnw34jveyxfqi2fu7oyheasid.onion&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;... if it does not work, you must download &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.torproject.org/download/&quot;&amp;gt;Tor Browser for your device&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/ciii1r5wafk81.png?width=3407&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=ea29fb95e54c4a7c4184675754b8a8f3ff124dfc&quot;&amp;gt;They usually place fancy screenshots of the apps in the play store / apple store. This is just my attempt to conform to expectations. There is more to RoboSats that what can be seen here, make sure to read the how-to-use guide.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;In more details&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Here a full guide with two complete walk-throughs: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/reckless-satoshi/robosats/blob/main/docs/how-to-use.md&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;How to Use RoboSats&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You can also read the full list of features in the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/reckless-satoshi/robosats/releases/tag/v0.1.0-mvp&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;RoboSats v0.1.0 stack release&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;What payment methods are accepted?&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Basically all of them as long as they are FAST. You can write down your preferred payment method(s). You will have to match with a peer who also accepts that method as you pay each other directly. The step in the contract to exchange fiat has an expiry time of 24 hours before a dispute is automatically opened. So, I highly recommend using instant fiat payment rails.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Are there trade limits?&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Maximum single trade size is 500,000 satoshis to minimize lightning routing failure. There is no limits to the number of trades per day. A robot can only have one order at a time. However, you can use multiple robots simultaneously in different browsers (remember to back up your robot tokens!). At launch RoboSats is limited to a maximum of 100 public orders at a time (...just a temporary safety measure).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Is RoboSats private?&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;RoboSats will absolutely never ask you for your name, email, phone number, country or ID. RoboSats does not custody your funds and does not care pinch about who you are. For best anonymity use Tor Browser and access the .onion hidden site.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Your trading peer is the only one who can potentially guess anything about you. Keep your chat short and concise. Avoid providing non-essential information other than strictly necessary for the fiat payment. But don&amp;amp;#39;t forget to be polite! :)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;What are the risks?&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is an experimental lightning application, things could go wrong. Trade small amounts! The seller faces the same charge-back risk as with any other peer-to-peer service. I do not recommend using Paypal or credit cards.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;What is the trust model?&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The buyer and the seller never have to trust each other. Some trust on RoboSats is needed since linking the seller&amp;amp;#39;s hold invoice and buyer payment is not atomic (research ongoing). In addition, disputes are solved by the RoboSats staff.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To be totally clear. Trust requirements are minimized. However, there is still one way RoboSats could run away with your satoshis: by not releasing the satoshis to the buyer. It could be argued that such move is not in the platform&amp;amp;#39;s interest as it would badly damage the reputation for a small payout. However, you should hesitate and only trade small quantities at a time. For large amounts use an on-chain escrow service such as Bisq. You can build more trust on RoboSats by inspecting the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/reckless-satoshi/robosats&quot;&amp;gt;source code&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;What are the fees?&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The trading fee is 0.2%. That&amp;amp;#39;s about the same as Binance, yet you will not have to pay a &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;withdrawal fine&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; (that same fee covers for the routing to your wallet). The fidelity bonds are sized 1% with respect the trade amount, these are automatically returned.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;What happens if RoboSats suddenly disappears?&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Your sats will return to you. Any hold invoice that is not settled will automatically return even if RoboSats goes down forever. This is true for both, locked bonds and trading escrows. However, there is a small window between the seller confirms FIAT RECEIVED and the moment the buyer receives the satoshis when the funds could be permanently lost if RoboSats disappears. This window is about 1 second long, so make sure to have enough inbound liquidity to avoid routing failures. If you have any problem, reach out trough the RoboSats public channels (&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://t.me/robosats&quot;&amp;gt;Telegram&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Is RoboSats legal in my country?&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In most countries using RoboSats is no different than using Ebay or Craiglist. Your regulation may vary. It is your responsibility to comply (lmao, sorry but I have to write this). If your country is shitty about p2p commerce start thinking about moving, it will only get worse.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Can I access it without Tor Browser / Brave?&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Not yet, and why should you? Use Tor and improve your privacy! However, the site &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;robosats.com&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; will be accessible at some point. It will be a simple web2tor bridge to widen the access to any browser and improve URL memorability... It comes with a huge set of caveats for privacy and security: so you should always use the .onion site and Tor Browser if possible!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;You make RoboSats a great place&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you like what you see, there is a lot of ways you can become part of this open project. The most needed contributions are: develop code (funding might be possible, ask); create tutorials and guides; open outbound LN channels towards &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://1ml.com/node/0282eb467bc073833a039940392592bf10cf338a830ba4e392c1667d7697654c7e&quot;&amp;gt;RoboSats node (1ML)&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;; create art (logo, banners, they are shitty rn); and help newbies in our community groups (Telegram: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://t.me/robosats&quot;&amp;gt;English&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://t.me/robosats_es&quot;&amp;gt;Spanish&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;). Needless to say, simply using the platform, telling a friend or sharing your idea/criticism is a huge help!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Give it a try now and contribute to make this open source project glorious!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cheers, &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

(No I&amp;amp;#39;m not expecting. But it is better to get this out of the way now)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyways, I made a template for anyone to mess with. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/13se29qf7V6V12VHdnaOXyQAu3wkbRf3xYeRrg7r7XXs/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&amp;gt;https://docs.google.com/document/d/13se29qf7V6V12VHdnaOXyQAu3wkbRf3xYeRrg7r7XXs/edit?usp=sharing&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;MAKE YOUR OWN COPY SO YOU CAN EDIT IT&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/1v4pspjdzfk81.png?width=920&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e01d5b5ce50cea60eefdac76524614ab2984664b&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/1v4pspjdzfk81.png?width=920&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e01d5b5ce50cea60eefdac76524614ab2984664b&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Obviously you would want to heavily edit this, but this should help you get started.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Big things to note is taxes, and how people will find out where your crypto is stored. I&amp;amp;#39;m using Koinly anyways to track everything for taxes. So I might as well make that in a way family can find whatever crypto and where it is.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Note I wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t put seed phrases or other things in this. To be blunt, I don&amp;amp;#39;t trust Google.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;NOTE I heavily use last pass to just give people my passwords in this time. This allows them to take whatever from my exchanges, and it allows them to bypass horrible support they most likely would get from &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://Binance.US&quot;&amp;gt;Binance.US&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. Plus since I even have a hard time remember which exchange has a KYC and what doesn&amp;amp;#39;t. This bypasses if the exchange even could do this.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Analysis by Paul Sonne from Washington Post.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Russian bank Tinkoff now offering to exchange rubles for dollars at a rate of 171 rubles per dollar. It was 83 before the European/US announcement about targeting the Russian central bank. Currency market formally opens tomorrow. This is brutal. &amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/8wljxfeqgfk81.png?width=1101&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=0552cc2b01039c7aeb560c96cd9e3acc7053fe55&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/8wljxfeqgfk81.png?width=1101&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=0552cc2b01039c7aeb560c96cd9e3acc7053fe55&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;According to coinmarketcap crypto has not yet realized this, and Bitcoin trades at the same price to RUB as usual. Even as Tether shows the drop.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/frh8m7hsgfk81.png?width=1445&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=b6e0b523b745652fb1dfa6123085d03c14012397&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/frh8m7hsgfk81.png?width=1445&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=b6e0b523b745652fb1dfa6123085d03c14012397&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Of course CMC can just be broken and not show the actual ruble/BTC rate. But be careful out there, and selling any crypto for ruble might be a really bad idea.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Of course if you have Rubles and any exchange still takes them, it might be a really good idea to switch to crypto, before the market wakes up :)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Regardless of the current situation the network should not be degraded or disconnected for Russian users.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Russian civilian&amp;amp;#39;s don&amp;amp;#39;t want a war. It&amp;amp;#39;s unlikely Russia government is using the BTC network anyway.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I too take Ukraine side in this disgusting act by Putin but we must maintain integrity of the Bitcoin network.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Edit&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To clarify it has been reported that some cryptocurrency pools are blocking access to Russia. This is not solely limited to just BTC.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Edit 2&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Just to be clear. I know exactly how the network works. I&amp;amp;#39;m stating freely and clearly that all pools should remain online and active for everyone and not to impose any restrictions as to retain the integrity of crypto currency.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As a pool owner you should NOT be making choices based of political decisions that may deliberately prevent end users from using the service.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In one of the posts, I showed that IOHK’s wallet could be traced to a huge, unstaked wallet that funded another wallet used in the alleged front-running of Sundae. The connection between IOHK’s wallet and the huge, unstaked wallet was made in about a dozen transfers, each with over 25 million ADA transfers with most transfers involving over a billion ADA.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I had said in a previous post that I did not believe this address &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://cardanoscan.io/address/addr1q8g77agasft90nnrln487665tf4nz9tt0z9df0l5z637yavnfrlkaatu28n0qzmqh7f2cpksxhpc9jefx3wrl0a2wu8qu5g9nq&quot;&amp;gt;https://cardanoscan.io/address/addr1q8g77agasft90nnrln487665tf4nz9tt0z9df0l5z637yavnfrlkaatu28n0qzmqh7f2cpksxhpc9jefx3wrl0a2wu8qu5g9nq&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; was an exchange account since it was unstaked and had nearly a billion ADA. My thinking was that if exchanges are willing to screw over customers by withholding withdrawals for a few days to make it to the next reward epoch, then they would not leave a billion unstaked. Based on that and given that this huge, unstaked wallet was tied to IOHK in a dozen large transactions, I made the claim that Charles was involved in the front-running of Sundae.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I apologize to Charles for jumping to that conclusion. I hope that IOHK will confirm that &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://cardanoscan.io/address/addr1q8g77agasft90nnrln487665tf4nz9tt0z9df0l5z637yavnfrlkaatu28n0qzmqh7f2cpksxhpc9jefx3wrl0a2wu8qu5g9nq&quot;&amp;gt;https://cardanoscan.io/address/addr1q8g77agasft90nnrln487665tf4nz9tt0z9df0l5z637yavnfrlkaatu28n0qzmqh7f2cpksxhpc9jefx3wrl0a2wu8qu5g9nq&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; is indeed a Coinbase address. I would ask IOHK to also consider stating whether IOHK funds are being held at this address, as was done in 2017 when IOHK disclosed its original address (&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2017/10/17/statement-on-iohks-ada-holdings/&quot;&amp;gt;https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2017/10/17/statement-on-iohks-ada-holdings/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;). That would explain the transaction path that led from IOHK’s 2017 address to the billion ADA unstaked wallet.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Secondly, I would also like to apologize to anyone who read and engaged with any of the posts I had made. Some of you spent time wrestling with the decision of whether to sell your ADA  based on the allegations I made. Some of you spent time debating with me as to whether the transactions were IOHK’s. Some of you spent time correcting my misunderstanding of reading UTXO’s. I’ve fixed the mistakes in the edited post regarding change addresses, but you spent more time than you would have had to if I had just made sure I had understood how to read UTXOs properly before posting what I posted. I apologize for wasting all of your time and causing a scare to those who considered selling.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Whether I end up being correct regarding the transactions being IOHK’s transactions is irrelevant. I made these posts in bad faith and without doing my due diligence. I was not trying to make anything up. When writing the post, I genuinely believed that the transactions listed were IOHK’s/Charles’ transactions and I genuinely believed that large, unstaked address could not have been an exchange wallet. I still believe that the transactions are IOHK’s, and I believe that when IOHK comes out with a statement, then that address will be a Coinbase address with IOHK funds. However, the post was in bad faith. My intention was never to save people from a scam coin or point out some wrong I felt had been committed. It was to reduce people’s trust in Cardano. I had not participated in the SundaeSwap launch, so I was not affected by any front-running or even cared to know who was involved in it. Those of you who called me out on bad faith motivations were correct on that point.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If IOHK confirms that the large, unstaked address is a Coinbase address, then some good may come out of this. If it becomes public knowledge that either Ae2tdPwUPEZ6xYrxCgRDM2NQFM5oajHEoJN3i9ZVV2AbsbvxoJBjVu3yP7W or addr1q8g77agasft90nnrln487665tf4nz9tt0z9df0l5z637yavnfrlkaatu28n0qzmqh7f2cpksxhpc9jefx3wrl0a2wu8qu5g9nq is a Coinbase address, then that allows some victims of scammers to report ADA scams to the authorities and/or Coinbase knowing that this is a Coinbase address. For example, here are some reports of scams with that address: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.cardano.org/t/report-a-youtube-fraud-give-away-scam-video/41265/64?page=4&quot;&amp;gt;https://forum.cardano.org/t/report-a-youtube-fraud-give-away-scam-video/41265/64?page=4&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/monivong_eth/status/1448744468417441819&quot;&amp;gt;https://twitter.com/monivong_eth/status/1448744468417441819&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, and &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://np.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/sp8e96/what_happened_to_my_ada/&quot;&amp;gt;https://np.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/sp8e96/what_happened_to_my_ada/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; (&amp;lt;a href=&quot;/u/zujizu&quot;&amp;gt;u/zujizu&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you’re a victim of a scam and you see your money going to the Coinbase address, you’ll now be able to contact Coinbase as well as the FBI’s new crypto unit (&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/technology/fbi-form-new-digital-currency-unit-justice-dept-taps-new-crypto-czar-2022-02-17/&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.reuters.com/technology/fbi-form-new-digital-currency-unit-justice-dept-taps-new-crypto-czar-2022-02-17/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;) knowing that Coinbase would be able to KYC the scammers and hopefully get your ADA back.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also, anyone who was concerned about the Sundae Swap front-running transaction can report it to the SEC knowing that Coinbase would be able to KYC it as well. The transactions to look at are &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://cardanoscan.io/transaction/5e495b9d447d180f5748f9c660c71f16ec993e0fd9afbdaef3ce33e357cb85ae&quot;&amp;gt;https://cardanoscan.io/transaction/5e495b9d447d180f5748f9c660c71f16ec993e0fd9afbdaef3ce33e357cb85ae&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://cardanoscan.io/transaction/b7418577cb7265c7a986595d57b9ae9b355b4e51dfda400e1bb0732ae6cca48f&quot;&amp;gt;https://cardanoscan.io/transaction/b7418577cb7265c7a986595d57b9ae9b355b4e51dfda400e1bb0732ae6cca48f&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. The addresses in question are addr1qxu7ja9hduaqllh08qddamckewlhxf06vaansaacgcw864qwq3wh8ycd3n4ulgmjsd7yg99dexmrjn5jvq02zndyl53sgu4pen and addr1qxw876l6pafu63z25muwvzt7fgjf9l7qtfmh4j5dq0v44xhtj5fxf9czefjucs9nkmlyrkuguj0rdll0knagj9wull7qh79w83, with the second one being directly tied to the front-running. If Coinbase owns the address ending in 5g9nq, then they can figure out who sent transfers to either the address ending in u4pen or 79w83. Coinbase isn’t going to investigate this without a formal official inquiry, so if you care about finding out who it is, you’ll have to submit a tip to probably the SEC.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This will be my last post on Cardano. Again, I apologize for wasting everyone&amp;amp;#39;s time this past week.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TLDR: I apologize to Charles and anyone who was scared, angered, or frustrated by my sensationalist posts regarding Charles’ alleged involvement in the front running of Sundae Swap.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This couldn&amp;amp;#39;t be farther away from the truth as the true power in stablecoins in yield farming. Some platforms like &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://nachoxyz.com/&quot;&amp;gt;Nacho&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://beefy.finance/&quot;&amp;gt;Beefy&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; offer very high APYs. Some even like Yield App offer near 20% on USDC and USDT.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I think stable and sustainable profits always defeat improbable ones for a memecoin where the probability of actually making profit is very low compared to that of DeFi where profits are ensured even if the whole market dips.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
