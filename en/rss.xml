&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In one of the posts, I showed that IOHK’s wallet could be traced to a huge, unstaked wallet that funded another wallet used in the alleged front-running of Sundae. The connection between IOHK’s wallet and the huge, unstaked wallet was made in about a dozen transfers, each with over 25 million ADA transfers with most transfers involving over a billion ADA.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I had said in a previous post that I did not believe this address &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://cardanoscan.io/address/addr1q8g77agasft90nnrln487665tf4nz9tt0z9df0l5z637yavnfrlkaatu28n0qzmqh7f2cpksxhpc9jefx3wrl0a2wu8qu5g9nq&quot;&amp;gt;https://cardanoscan.io/address/addr1q8g77agasft90nnrln487665tf4nz9tt0z9df0l5z637yavnfrlkaatu28n0qzmqh7f2cpksxhpc9jefx3wrl0a2wu8qu5g9nq&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; was an exchange account since it was unstaked and had nearly a billion ADA. My thinking was that if exchanges are willing to screw over customers by withholding withdrawals for a few days to make it to the next reward epoch, then they would not leave a billion unstaked. Based on that and given that this huge, unstaked wallet was tied to IOHK in a dozen large transactions, I made the claim that Charles was involved in the front-running of Sundae.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I apologize to Charles for jumping to that conclusion. I hope that IOHK will confirm that &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://cardanoscan.io/address/addr1q8g77agasft90nnrln487665tf4nz9tt0z9df0l5z637yavnfrlkaatu28n0qzmqh7f2cpksxhpc9jefx3wrl0a2wu8qu5g9nq&quot;&amp;gt;https://cardanoscan.io/address/addr1q8g77agasft90nnrln487665tf4nz9tt0z9df0l5z637yavnfrlkaatu28n0qzmqh7f2cpksxhpc9jefx3wrl0a2wu8qu5g9nq&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; is indeed a Coinbase address. I would ask IOHK to also consider stating whether IOHK funds are being held at this address, as was done in 2017 when IOHK disclosed its original address (&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2017/10/17/statement-on-iohks-ada-holdings/&quot;&amp;gt;https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2017/10/17/statement-on-iohks-ada-holdings/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;). That would explain the transaction path that led from IOHK’s 2017 address to the billion ADA unstaked wallet.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Secondly, I would also like to apologize to anyone who read and engaged with any of the posts I had made. Some of you spent time wrestling with the decision of whether to sell your ADA  based on the allegations I made. Some of you spent time debating with me as to whether the transactions were IOHK’s. Some of you spent time correcting my misunderstanding of reading UTXO’s. I’ve fixed the mistakes in the edited post regarding change addresses, but you spent more time than you would have had to if I had just made sure I had understood how to read UTXOs properly before posting what I posted. I apologize for wasting all of your time and causing a scare to those who considered selling.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Whether I end up being correct regarding the transactions being IOHK’s transactions is irrelevant. I made these posts in bad faith and without doing my due diligence. I was not trying to make anything up. When writing the post, I genuinely believed that the transactions listed were IOHK’s/Charles’ transactions and I genuinely believed that large, unstaked address could not have been an exchange wallet. I still believe that the transactions are IOHK’s, and I believe that when IOHK comes out with a statement, then that address will be a Coinbase address with IOHK funds. However, the post was in bad faith. My intention was never to save people from a scam coin or point out some wrong I felt had been committed. It was to reduce people’s trust in Cardano. I had not participated in the SundaeSwap launch, so I was not affected by any front-running or even cared to know who was involved in it. Those of you who called me out on bad faith motivations were correct on that point.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If IOHK confirms that the large, unstaked address is a Coinbase address, then some good may come out of this. If it becomes public knowledge that either Ae2tdPwUPEZ6xYrxCgRDM2NQFM5oajHEoJN3i9ZVV2AbsbvxoJBjVu3yP7W or addr1q8g77agasft90nnrln487665tf4nz9tt0z9df0l5z637yavnfrlkaatu28n0qzmqh7f2cpksxhpc9jefx3wrl0a2wu8qu5g9nq is a Coinbase address, then that allows some victims of scammers to report ADA scams to the authorities and/or Coinbase knowing that this is a Coinbase address. For example, here are some reports of scams with that address: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.cardano.org/t/report-a-youtube-fraud-give-away-scam-video/41265/64?page=4&quot;&amp;gt;https://forum.cardano.org/t/report-a-youtube-fraud-give-away-scam-video/41265/64?page=4&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/monivong_eth/status/1448744468417441819&quot;&amp;gt;https://twitter.com/monivong_eth/status/1448744468417441819&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, and &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://np.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/sp8e96/what_happened_to_my_ada/&quot;&amp;gt;https://np.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/sp8e96/what_happened_to_my_ada/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; (&amp;lt;a href=&quot;/u/zujizu&quot;&amp;gt;u/zujizu&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you’re a victim of a scam and you see your money going to the Coinbase address, you’ll now be able to contact Coinbase as well as the FBI’s new crypto unit (&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/technology/fbi-form-new-digital-currency-unit-justice-dept-taps-new-crypto-czar-2022-02-17/&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.reuters.com/technology/fbi-form-new-digital-currency-unit-justice-dept-taps-new-crypto-czar-2022-02-17/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;) knowing that Coinbase would be able to KYC the scammers and hopefully get your ADA back.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also, anyone who was concerned about the Sundae Swap front-running transaction can report it to the SEC knowing that Coinbase would be able to KYC it as well. The transactions to look at are &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://cardanoscan.io/transaction/5e495b9d447d180f5748f9c660c71f16ec993e0fd9afbdaef3ce33e357cb85ae&quot;&amp;gt;https://cardanoscan.io/transaction/5e495b9d447d180f5748f9c660c71f16ec993e0fd9afbdaef3ce33e357cb85ae&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://cardanoscan.io/transaction/b7418577cb7265c7a986595d57b9ae9b355b4e51dfda400e1bb0732ae6cca48f&quot;&amp;gt;https://cardanoscan.io/transaction/b7418577cb7265c7a986595d57b9ae9b355b4e51dfda400e1bb0732ae6cca48f&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. The addresses in question are addr1qxu7ja9hduaqllh08qddamckewlhxf06vaansaacgcw864qwq3wh8ycd3n4ulgmjsd7yg99dexmrjn5jvq02zndyl53sgu4pen and addr1qxw876l6pafu63z25muwvzt7fgjf9l7qtfmh4j5dq0v44xhtj5fxf9czefjucs9nkmlyrkuguj0rdll0knagj9wull7qh79w83, with the second one being directly tied to the front-running. If Coinbase owns the address ending in 5g9nq, then they can figure out who sent transfers to either the address ending in u4pen or 79w83. Coinbase isn’t going to investigate this without a formal official inquiry, so if you care about finding out who it is, you’ll have to submit a tip to probably the SEC.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This will be my last post on Cardano. Again, I apologize for wasting everyone&amp;amp;#39;s time this past week.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TLDR: I apologize to Charles and anyone who was scared, angered, or frustrated by my sensationalist posts regarding Charles’ alleged involvement in the front running of Sundae Swap.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can&amp;amp;#39;t call the FBI, tell them 2M in cash was stolen from your safe, and have them wait for the criminal to spend some of it so they know his location. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Only dumb criminals get caught...like when someone is paying  $25,000,000 all cash for new condo complex in Hawaii.  That&amp;amp;#39;s when someone gets suspicious and calls the FBI.    That&amp;amp;#39;s pretty much the only time they can catch you in cash transaction....when someone calls them on you. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With a Bitcoin transaction, the probability of you being caught after stealing a wallet they are now keeping track of actually goes up.     Yeah, there&amp;amp;#39;s ways to unload it into different cryptos using an encrypted throwaway mobile that&amp;amp;#39;s not connected to you or anyone you know but it&amp;amp;#39;s actually a tedious process if you don&amp;amp;#39;t want to get caught.     Using &amp;amp;quot;stolen cash&amp;amp;quot; or using cash from illegal earnings is much much easier than using a stolen BTC wallet. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You use just $10 in Bitcoin from that wallet, and you can get nailed.       If you use a couple of $100 cash at a random store..  nobody is calling the FBI on you.  Because it&amp;amp;#39;s a normal everyday transaction. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So you can have 2M in stolen cash and just sit on that for life using little by little, doing lightweight money laundering that doesn&amp;amp;#39;t look too suspicious and nobody will suspect anything.     You can&amp;amp;#39;t sit on a stolen BTC wallet for life and use it little by little without jumping through fire hoops or paranoid about being caught everytime you use it. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That&amp;amp;#39;s the point I&amp;amp;#39;m trying to make.   They are lying to everyone about how dangerous BTC usage is.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Gold is acting counterintuitively as well, retreating from a feel-good faux spike. Russia&amp;amp;#39;s largest bank limited withdrawals to $20 yesterday. Apple Pay doesn&amp;amp;#39;t work after Apple removed banking support in Russia. Reports on the ground that most debit cards have been suspended.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Right now, we should all invoke that same community giving mentality and put our Satoshis where our thoughts and prayers are. Dig deep, send what you can, and lets show the world why cryptocurrency is the future of finance. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you&amp;amp;#39;re a miner, point your rewards to Ukraine, if you&amp;amp;#39;re staking, stake in the name of Ukraine, if you&amp;amp;#39;re a hodler let your grip ease up in the name of a free and independent Ukraine. There is no middle-man here. Ukraine has official wallet addresses to accept donations. This is what crypto was made to be used for-- So lets use it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Note: If you do donate, please send the Transx # in the comments below along with an indication of the country you are from so your fellow crypto enthusiasts can give some love.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Transcript:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Stand with the people of Ukraine. Now accepting cryptocurrency donations. Bitcoin, Ethereum and USDT.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;BTC - &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/357a3So9CbsNfBBgFYACGvxxS6tMaDoa1P&quot;&amp;gt;357a3So9CbsNfBBgFYACGvxxS6tMaDoa1P&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;ETH and USDT (ERC-20) - &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://etherscan.io/address/0x165CD37b4C644C2921454429E7F9358d18A45e14&quot;&amp;gt;0x165CD37b4C644C2921454429E7F9358d18A45e14&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; (and &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://bscscan.com/address/0x165CD37b4C644C2921454429E7F9358d18A45e14&quot;&amp;gt;BSC Scan&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As always, be careful when sending donations in crypto, since it&amp;amp;#39;s really hard to verify the owners of crypto wallets without much proof&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Whenever I see a news about a dictator country banning crypto, I feel so bullish because if dictator countries hate crypto that means Crypto works as it should. Because they can&amp;amp;#39;t control it. They are afraid of losing their power on their citizens. This is exactly what crypto is supposed to be, giving 100% control to people. Peer 2 peer. There is no middle man. There is no control freak authority. This is what decentralization is supposed to be and dictators hate that. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If a dictatorial country is trying to ban crypto, know that Crypto is on the right track.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;No matter how much those dictators try to ban it, Crypto is INEVITABLE.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Obviously, it sucks that psychopaths take to crypto to hide illicit activity, and that it gets publicized in a way that paints crypto in a bad light. But if we want crypto to maintain its autonomous decentralization, we have to accept all of its shortcomings. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto scares the shit out of the powers that be for all the reasons we love it. It gives power back to the people, unfortunately there&amp;amp;#39;s bad people out there and fear sells, so the media likes to focus on it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I don’t agree with anything that’s going on in Russia right now, but I do believe in crypto maintaining its decentralization.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Once a project has already gained popularity on subreddits like this one, it’s almost certain that you already missed out on a 100x&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This doesn’t mean you still can’t profit from popular coins on this sub. But don’t expect 4 digit % gains.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The problem is that investing in still unpopular startups could be very risky. You risk rug pulls or scams since this market is completely unregulated.
And while there are exceptions with projects with insurance backing like Solanaprime and others that can mitigate such risks, for the most part it will be risky otherwise.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The important thing is to not get impulsive and let FOMO take control over you. Always make educated guesses and well thought out investments. This is the only reliable way to make profit long term.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Financially supporting the Ukrainian army or people who are suffering is a fantastic and noble thing to do. It’s the right thing do and the least most of us can do.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I wish I could buy the bullets that personally kill the Russian invaders. But it’s not that simple.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As we all know scammers have a vacuum for a heart and are trying to profit off of this crisis. “Ukrainian relief funds” are more than likely scammers accepting your thoughtful donations. Worse yet even Russians creating fake donations to soak up the funds for their cause.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The ONLY way I would donate is by sending it directly to someone you know of in Ukraine who needs it or can distribute it. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Do NOT let your guard down. Scammers will profit off of anything even this. Yes it is a new low.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If anything, this will give you the ability to change strategies. I actually sold around 55k and slowly started seeing that Bitcoin isnt the right investment for me.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I started staking and went heavy on DeFi projects like AAVE since they’re the best at lending (which gave me a lot of leverage)and new ones like BitDAO which have the largest treasury in the market so the governance power behind it was strong.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TAKING PROFITS IS NOT SHAMEFUL.
I don’t know why this sub treats it as a sin. Its actually smart to sell if you make an educated decision as to when.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There are some weird people on here. ‘Funding someone’s war’, ‘Russia uses bitcoin - bitcoin is bad’. There always has to be those few people who try to be too clever. Innocent civilians are dying because they’ve been invaded by a dictator, hellbent on making history, and all you care about is trying to win internet points by being edgy and against the grain. Get a grip. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Just a small minority though, and thankfully most of this sub is full of kind people. Peace and love ❤️&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;His post:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is a follow-up to &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/szv6oc/evidence_that_charlesiohk_was_involved_in/&quot;&amp;gt;https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/szv6oc/evidence_that_charlesiohk_was_involved_in/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In that post, I gave a list of about 150 addresses that connected IOHK&amp;amp;#39;s wallet to the billion ADA unstaked wallet involved in the SundaeSwap front-running. Naturally, I was accused of FUD, saying that I made it up and that there was no way someone could track that accurately.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here&amp;amp;#39;s a much shorter path connecting the two wallets.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;📷&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Starting from IOHK&amp;amp;#39;s address &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://cardanoscan.io/transactions?address=DdzFFzCqrhsytyf2oUxqFNXDX9MfAFBWk9pTBXViZbSwxEi7PYcq9LSjBDcW6BVcA7KxgeixYWospQKn68P9PaviM2FvhTFvsEezT8qg&quot;&amp;gt;https://cardanoscan.io/transactions?address=DdzFFzCqrhsytyf2oUxqFNXDX9MfAFBWk9pTBXViZbSwxEi7PYcq9LSjBDcW6BVcA7KxgeixYWospQKn68P9PaviM2FvhTFvsEezT8qg&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, it takes less than 15 steps to go from that wallet to the billion ADA unstaked wallet associated with the SundaeSwap front-running.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can see in the left column the outgoing address along the path, and in the right column, you see the amount of one of the transactions from the prior address to that address. The right column only gives one transaction amount even when there may be others, since it&amp;amp;#39;s only looking at the first page of transactions when going to the transactions page. If there were dozens of transactions outgoing to that address, then the right column only is reporting one of them listed on the first page of transactions. You can see that all but one transaction is on the order of hundreds of millions or billions of ADA. This is not IOHK paying an employee (unless employees are being paid hundreds of millions of ADA!).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To follow along with how to read the table, first go to IOHK&amp;amp;#39;s original wallet &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://cardanoscan.io/transactions?address=DdzFFzCqrhsytyf2oUxqFNXDX9MfAFBWk9pTBXViZbSwxEi7PYcq9LSjBDcW6BVcA7KxgeixYWospQKn68P9PaviM2FvhTFvsEezT8qg&quot;&amp;gt;https://cardanoscan.io/transactions?address=DdzFFzCqrhsytyf2oUxqFNXDX9MfAFBWk9pTBXViZbSwxEi7PYcq9LSjBDcW6BVcA7KxgeixYWospQKn68P9PaviM2FvhTFvsEezT8qg&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. Then find the first outgoing address in the table above and click that link to go to the transactions for that address.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So click on: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://cardanoscan.io/address/DdzFFzCqrht3wEZNURs9U5Qp7HnLoi9Cpao2YzThm88CqvLuP9uTmGzpwQc2e9VSUNGPhR7pAz3g9TtnBx3YoiiJ712Va3dBZNTXkTYT&quot;&amp;gt;https://cardanoscan.io/address/DdzFFzCqrht3wEZNURs9U5Qp7HnLoi9Cpao2YzThm88CqvLuP9uTmGzpwQc2e9VSUNGPhR7pAz3g9TtnBx3YoiiJ712Va3dBZNTXkTYT&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then go to the next outgoing address in the table: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://cardanoscan.io/address/DdzFFzCqrhsrbtzv9G1qXfGq5mKVeF6AWg2TcuS3qjfLyhHgVATsP3PeocKqkraN6VwbZrNvN2iHeCd8iESanCP8FQS6BnyaThGjLNEc&quot;&amp;gt;https://cardanoscan.io/address/DdzFFzCqrhsrbtzv9G1qXfGq5mKVeF6AWg2TcuS3qjfLyhHgVATsP3PeocKqkraN6VwbZrNvN2iHeCd8iESanCP8FQS6BnyaThGjLNEc&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then go to the next outgoing address in the table: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://cardanoscan.io/address/DdzFFzCqrhsnRxkcmJ1ukkN26iefboWFwKLx95G2bW92mutMGqibYJNYuNgbGppCC32tfqWMa8XpWev9jVXoNUQEQPmcDeRh28UJBXvC&quot;&amp;gt;https://cardanoscan.io/address/DdzFFzCqrhsnRxkcmJ1ukkN26iefboWFwKLx95G2bW92mutMGqibYJNYuNgbGppCC32tfqWMa8XpWev9jVXoNUQEQPmcDeRh28UJBXvC&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You don&amp;amp;#39;t need to question whether I made up these transactions or manipulated the Cardano blockchain in some way. These records are immutable and they are available for you to verify, so go verify. I will probably be accused of being a paranoid schizophrenic again, and maybe I am, but who cares! The point of blockchain is that you don&amp;amp;#39;t need to trust me or anyone else. I know some of you reading this will instinctively be defensive and lash out with insults, but I dare you to verify the transactions yourself before downvoting.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Edit:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Thanks for taking up the challenge and looking into this. Some of you found that there was only a 10 ADA transaction between two of the addresses. That&amp;amp;#39;s because both output addresses (one with 10 ADA and the other with 241 million ADA) are tied to the same wallet. It&amp;amp;#39;s not obvious, but you can read more here &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/t0q8kn/comment/hyc8719/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;amp;context=3&quot;&amp;gt;https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/t0q8kn/comment/hyc8719/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;amp;context=3&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The TLDR form of that comment is: the wallet address ending in bs1Wq and wallet address ending in oQU1E are part of the same wallet. You can tell this since they are both outputs of TxHash 547f47b146464476c2da4184fa9123d147053b2e5c84d1f0ede1479a12afbd97, and then one is the input (oQU1E) while the other (bs1Wq) is the output of the next transaction of the bs1Wq address, with TxHash d632d8f487f156c2c91a46e15b066a22888aa2f71ed61bd2d33dd61f46b9590c. That indicates that these two addresses are linked and that the second transaction is a reshuffling of ADA between addresses of the same wallet.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Even if you aren&amp;amp;#39;t convinced that they are part of the same wallet, then suppose they&amp;amp;#39;re separate, independent addresses. Then that only adds one more address on the path connecting IOHK&amp;amp;#39;s wallet to the billion ADA unstaked wallet:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The volume from Tf4YT to oQU1E would be 241M. The volume from oQU1E to bs1Wq would be 25M.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TLDR: Don&amp;amp;#39;t try to hard to make some transaction history a proof of something that is not.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Guy had too much time and wanted CH to be a bad guy.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Don&amp;amp;#39;t upvote this post too much, because the whole trilogy is a waste of crypto jurnalism. If you have time tho, go to the 2nd part and downvote the moonfarmer. Fake proof should not deserve moons IMO.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How in the h-e-double hockey sticks does everyone figure out how farm/lend/stake/auto compound all these different protocols? I’ve spent the last few months watching videos, joining social media servers, reading articles and exploring platforms. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I feel more lost than ever. I just get to the point where I think I’ve figured out a way to earn a reasonable yield only to find out that it’s outdated and there are half a dozen new and improved ways to do what I’m looking for. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I’ve never been on a wilder goose chase. I can’t tell if I’m a technological idiot or if it really is this time consuming and difficult?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;EDIT: I’m not talking about staking PoS coins like ADA, DOT, etc. What I meant was coins/tokens that require additional steps such as BTC, LINK, etc. And yes, I could stake those on Celsius or BlockFi but I was referring more to LPs. But you are all correct, I am probably taking more time than the average person to figure this out. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It would appear I am a slight to moderate technological idiot&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
