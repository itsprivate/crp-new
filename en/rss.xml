You know that when you go to bed and when you wake up in the morning something will have changed in your portfolio; things jump up or fall off of a cliff our of nowhere and you&amp;amp;#39;re just lying there thinking about what you&amp;amp;#39;re going to buy when it all works out (because it feels like an inevitability); you wake up and shrug off the -5% because you&amp;amp;#39;re sure that eventually it&amp;amp;#39;ll be made up, and it might not even take that long because of how quickly things seem to gain or lose momentum. At first it&amp;amp;#39;s stressful but if you stick around you develop a kind of gallows humour where you just laugh and wait for the next day to come around to throw more coins into the money pit. Because one day you know you&amp;amp;#39;ll have enough for that little impractical squashed-looking yellow car.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Obviously, if you do not know how something works, you can&amp;amp;#39;t see potential in it in terms of what it can do. If you think the limits of NFTs are jpegs of monkeys or in-game upgrades and Bitcoin is just internet money which takes a lot of energy to move around, you do not understand why there is all the hype around them. It would of course look like a ponzi scheme to you.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Low intelligence, and the lack of understanding of the world around you and the way it works lends itself to conspiratorial thinking. This is found in &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psypost.org/2021/07/new-study-indicates-conspiracy-theory-believers-have-less-developed-critical-thinking-ability-61347&quot;&amp;gt;study after study&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. If things around you are confusing and you don&amp;amp;#39;t understand them, but it seems like at least &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;some&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; people understand them, of course you would think they are in cahoots. It&amp;amp;#39;s easier to say they must be in cahoots than to acknowledge your own intellectual failings. You are the dementia patient who won&amp;amp;#39;t admit or lacks the awareness to know that they are just forgetting where they put things, so you instead accuse everybody around you of stealing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the same way, lack of understanding about blockchain leads you to believe it&amp;amp;#39;s all a conspiracy, ponzi scheme, FOMO/hype nonsense, etc. Are there some conspiracies in the world? Of course. But is your average watcher of &amp;amp;quot;Ancient aliens&amp;amp;quot; or subscriber to the conspiracy subreddit the smartest duck in the room? No. The world is too complicated, and they seek a simple solution which makes them seem like they understand everything, they don&amp;amp;#39;t want to be somebody who is confused all the time, they just want the world to make sense, and conspiracy gives them a simple explanation that does, even if it seems fantastical to others. It&amp;amp;#39;s a very understandable human response to having too much information, and we all do it from time to time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;All the intelligent, well-spoken people I know who -- understand blockchain tech --have no problem thinking creatively about many, many use cases for it&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. People who are much smarter than me, who can explain what a zk-rollup is and why it matters. They may say that a lot of the NFT stuff is hype, or guardedly say that crypto can&amp;amp;#39;t solve everything, or that web3 has some kinks to work out, because of course it does, it is a new technology. Intelligent people &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;are not afraid of nuance and complexity&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; because they can keep track of it all. They don&amp;amp;#39;t jump to the conclusion that it&amp;amp;#39;s all or nothing, or that because they don&amp;amp;#39;t understand it, it must not have value. They aren&amp;amp;#39;t afraid to admit when they are wrong, or that their understanding may change in the future, they understand the world is not binary and that some things are complex enough that they lack the knowledge to fully understand them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto is the future. Tech geniuses see it. Major financial institutions see it. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Your friend who thinks crypto is a scam doesn&amp;amp;#39;t. And that&amp;amp;#39;s ok, they don&amp;amp;#39;t have to.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; They would have said the same thing about the internet, and they&amp;amp;#39;ll be using it in 20 years whether they&amp;amp;#39;re excited about it or not.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But if you really want to challenge them, ask questions. Ask them &amp;amp;quot;why?&amp;amp;quot; and you will quickly find they have no fucking idea what they are even talking about. So don&amp;amp;#39;t waste your time debating them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

[ &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html&quot;&amp;gt;https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; ] &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Shout out to Moxie for actually talking about how shit has just become super overcomplicated for coders to even begin to get into. This article is probably the best critique of the current crypto space I&amp;amp;#39;ve ever read ^&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We have these ideas of immutable, trustless, decentralized platforms but most of them have become mutable and centralized with all trust put in the hands of a few servers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cardano, for example, the fact that &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://cryptosrus.com/cardstarter-and-sundaeswap-a-falling-out-story/&quot;&amp;gt;sundaeswap took 6 months to release and it&amp;amp;#39;s not even fully ready yet&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; …&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://coin.fyi/news/cardano/cardstarter-and-every-single-project-it-has-launched-smells-of-a-scam-nmrfpt&quot;&amp;gt;plus looking like they rugged cardstarter&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, it’s not a good look!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Trustless&amp;amp;quot; doesn&amp;amp;#39;t make sense when there&amp;amp;#39;s still just a team of greedy humans on the other end of single phone line. I recall when my friends where first getting into crypto a few months ago, best believe it wasn&amp;amp;#39;t &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;‘for the tech’&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, it was pure greed, they were aping hundreds into doggy coins hoping to make millions out of thin air. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Arweave, which was made to solve the issue of NFTs being backed by on centralized servers, is still putting trust in the hands of others, so it&amp;amp;#39;s not exactly &amp;amp;quot;trustless&amp;amp;quot; and things can still be flagged for deletion and stuff like that. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.arweave.org/technology&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.arweave.org/technology&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;  = &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Finally, those that maintain gateways (the servers you will likely use to view the permaweb) can also apply content moderation policies to further safeguard their users.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s tricky though, like if you have permanent jpeg storage on a truly immutable permanent server what about criminal abuse material and other f’ed up stuff like that from being put on there ‘for good’? That&amp;amp;#39;s why Arweave has a democratic processes for removal of content if it&amp;amp;#39;s deemed necessary, but the problem is it&amp;amp;#39;s SLOW! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Just like Cardano, just like ETH, and Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and so on. All these truly decentralized things are slow as shit.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Compare the time it takes to load this:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://audius.co/neonanesthetics&quot;&amp;gt;https://audius.co/neonanesthetics&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;With this:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/artist/4h3dx3iH28dTFooTspQqxd&quot;&amp;gt;https://open.spotify.com/artist/4h3dx3iH28dTFooTspQqxd&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This just really highlights the sheer magnitude of the blockchain trilemma: &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Low Cost, Speed, Decentralization. Pick 2.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I still believe in crypto, but if this doesn&amp;amp;#39;t make you think...I&amp;amp;#39;ve always said there will probably be a dominant cryptocurrency in the future that solves all of these issues, but less and less am I thinking it will be any networks available today. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It will likely be built upon 6G network protocols, or some similar competing concept; 6G will basically mishmash the current 5G super-speed, satellite based internet, to that of the internet of things, peer2peer data transfer, and blockchain(s). &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here&amp;amp;#39;s a journal article from last summer: &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Blockchain and 6G: The Future of Secure and Ubiquitous Communication&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.05673.pdf&quot;&amp;gt;https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.05673.pdf&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;  = &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;the trustless nature of blockchain would make it easier to manage and audit 3D network resources and AI model parameters in 6G networks.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Another example, in Windows update there&amp;amp;#39;s this:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/jfd16glvkzf81.png?width=732&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=8119e238830ba28eba85c150763a516e13c85373&quot;&amp;gt;Microsoft Windows Update Delivery Optimization&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now extrapolate that concept out to creating the blockchain and the internet itself, not just simple data transfer - it&amp;amp;#39;ll be a mix of current cell-tower tech sped up a thousand-fold by decentralizing server loads through peer2peer means, encrypted, and under consensus - all while having latency speeds measured in single digit milliseconds!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here is a latency test of my internet to google: Top is with VPN routed through Portugal : Bottom is without VPN.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/szcppeg2lzf81.png?width=722&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=4ae7a88e08ba577ff67785c362d5beba976f4b17&quot;&amp;gt;Ping Command to Test Your Network&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We need speeds 1 order of magnitude faster than the current best case scenario technologies, and 2 orders of magnitude faster than what&amp;amp;#39;s the more &amp;amp;quot;practical&amp;amp;quot; speeds we&amp;amp;#39;re used to. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To conclude this spiel, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;I think we&amp;amp;#39;re about a decade away from this all.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Till then, I am still having fun learning about money, economics, fiancé, decentralization issues, network effects, but less and less am I feeling married to any single current network/blockchain because they all seem to be unable to carry the load that will weigh on future technological shoulders.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So don&amp;amp;#39;t make any reckless decisions, stick to the plans you made before this pump, and calm down a bit. You&amp;amp;#39;ll do better if you stay humble and keep a level head on yourself. Cheers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Market kept going down so I kept posting collateral as needed to keep the loan healthy.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I got an email saying that the loan was being called back because of &amp;amp;quot;indirect exposure to a mixing service&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I appealed the decision because I bought the BTC back in May of 2020 and kept it on my Trezor the entire time. However, since I didn&amp;amp;#39;t buy it on an exchange and the person before me mixed it (BISQ) I get absolutely screwed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In summary I took out a loan when BTC was 65,000, Cost me over $6000 in origination fees, paid two months of loan payments ($2500+), got liquidated at $37,000 a few MINUTES before a pump to $42,000 today because of &amp;amp;quot;indirect mixing exposure&amp;amp;quot; and now I lost more than half of my BTC holdings, have a huge tax bill, and was screwed out of a fortune.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;DO NOT USE BLOCKFI LOANS. Worst experience I have ever had in Bitcoin&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;EDIT: Since everybody keeps saying &amp;amp;quot;Dont take loans to buy crypto&amp;amp;quot; I am adding this comment to the main post&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;My bank did not consider BTC as an asset. I took out the loan with the intention of showing the balance in my bank account so I can get the mortgage and was planning on paying off the loans to get my BTC back.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Didnt work out......&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;EDIT 2: Most importantly the main problem for me was the P2P nature of the transaction. They literally do not allow you to buy your BTC from any private source that does not perform KYC. This is the biggest piece of fuckery of the entire situation that people need to pay very close attention to. I didnt, and it cost me 100s of thousands&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Crypto hasn&amp;amp;#39;t yet lost its steam and it was dragged down by the stock market for the past few days. This has accumulated A LOT of shorters.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/lx6hz6ct4vf81.jpg?width=1525&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=3a4eec27f4f445c3f55ba4977521da9c6237463b&quot;&amp;gt;Short positions are extremely high&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Just looking at this alone should give you a picture of what has been happening. There are a lot of people that are shorting the market right now, and a Bitcoin short squeeze is likely considering that whales have been eating up the weeks long selling pressure with huge purchases. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Short  Squeeze Indications&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Substantial amount of buying pressure.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;  ✅ &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;RSI below 30 for an unnatural amount of time.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; ✅ &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Short interest way above 20%.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;  ✅ &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Huge sudden uptick in price.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; ✅ &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The market indications are suggesting a textbook short squeeze scenario for Bitcoin, and that might potentially reverse the Crypto market&amp;amp;#39;s trajectory. Remember, Bitcoin is already 10% up in a matter of a few hours. This means people shorting are at a loss and they will either have to sell at a loss or borrow more shares, driving up the price. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;TLDR:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Bitcoin closed one of the biggest green candles in over a year, and it is most likely the beginning of a short squeeze due to an unusually large amount of people shorting the market. Moreover, surpassing 40k in a matter of  hours just invalidated weeks of FUD. If this continues, investors will be looking at a bullish Crypto market and a bearish stock market which is possibly the best environment for another huge bull run.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Investigating Latency&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;We&amp;amp;#39;re investigating latency on Coinbase.com and the mobile app and difficulty with trades / payments. Our teams are working to restore full service ASAP.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Interesting that the exchanges never go down when the market crashes. When that happens and everyone scrambles online to try and paperhand sell their crypto in a race to the bottom they seem to always work impeccably.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However, the markets suddenly surge over 10% and they suddenly just cannot handle the bandwidth. Almost as if they had significantly too little crypto in their reserves and a sudden price hike would mean they didn&amp;amp;#39;t have the time to increase their reserves. Almost as if they were expecting the market to drop further and that gamble didn&amp;amp;#39;t pay off so better bring out the ol &amp;amp;#39;we&amp;amp;#39;re experiencing technical difficulty please stand by.&amp;amp;#39;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Of course perhaps it&amp;amp;#39;s all a giant coincidence it happens every time....&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

This figure may change quite a bit as it was 85% when I started writing this post and now it&amp;amp;#39;s at 88%. The 122 million figure may change as well as time passes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some simple math of 88% multiplied by 122 million means that approximately 107 million dollars in shorts were liquidated. Take that bears!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At the time of writing, over 50 million dollars were Bitcoin shorts and over 40 million dollars were Ethereum shorts. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The largest single liquidation order happened on Okex - BTC-USDT-SWAP valued at $3.18 million.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the past 24 hours, 54542 traders were liquidated.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is the risk of trading with leverage and the saying &amp;amp;quot;invest only what you can afford to lose&amp;amp;quot; applies the most if you decide to dabble with this strategy.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I love it when shorts are liquidated. I hope this trend continues and we go onwards and upwards.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

In this sense, the trust relationship between holders and CEXs is crucial: when you buy BTC or ETH, you want the exchange to actually own these tokens.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That&amp;amp;#39;s why I was very pleased to learn today that Kraken has &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kraken.com/proof-of-reserves/?utm_source=content+announcement&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;amp;utm_campaign=por+announcement&amp;amp;amp;utm_content=content+link&amp;amp;amp;j=239745&amp;amp;amp;sfmc_sub=49972818&amp;amp;amp;l=227_HTML&amp;amp;amp;u=3691634&amp;amp;amp;mid=514004678&amp;amp;amp;jb=121&quot;&amp;gt;just launched a new way&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; for their customers to verify, with cryptographic proof, that their tokens are actually in their accounts.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s called &amp;amp;quot;proof of reserves&amp;amp;quot;, and here&amp;amp;#39;s how it works. Twice a year, an auditor takes an anonymized snapshot of all balances held and aggregates them into what is called a Merkle tree, a private database that encapsulates all client balances. Some cryptographic magic happens (the actual operation is quite complicated to go over in this post), and voilà! Users can now verify their balances with a few clicks.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;You don&amp;amp;#39;t have to take Kraken words for granted : they can prove to you they&amp;amp;#39;re actually holding the tokens you bought.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In full disclosure, I have to say that I&amp;amp;#39;ve been a Kraken customer since I started in crypto, so I&amp;amp;#39;m not entirely neutral. However, in my opinion, this kind of practice allows our ecosystem to gain credibility. The days of Mt. Gox and Quadriga are well and truly over!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Within hours, a trading desk Jump Capital agreed to replenish the entire amount so that the liquidations calamity is avoided. The loss of the peg due to the hack could have sent the network into cascading liquidations arising out of leveraged positions. In stepped a VC to save the day.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/adhsxhuefqf81.jpg?width=1172&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=7ed759f03c763a7cfd07d8bb35a03cff7aa3921d&quot;&amp;gt;Lost $320m? Thats fine.. we got you covered. &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The fact that VCs are ready to cover these kind of losses shows that the entire Solana &amp;amp;quot;ecosystem&amp;amp;quot; is just one big sham propped up by these same VCs. They dont want their baby to die just yet. Apparently Jump Capital owns a significant stake in Wormhole and is ready to sink such a huge amount to cover losses. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In Solana, the top 1.34% of addresses owns 99% of the circulating supply. Most of the supply was sold to early VCs and insiders at a massive discount to retail. Insiders and bad actors like Chamath have publicly joked about using Solana as a vehicle to play their pumps and dumps out, leaving retail to hold the bags when the sham unfolds. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;VCs dont just sink in $300m to save the day, unless they have already taken out 50x that amount - that is what Solana has enabled them to do already.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So a buncha SOL Shills be like hurr durr even ehtirium had hacks and was saved by fork. Well the DAO hack was solved by cryptography solutions (forking), not by VCs stepping into save the day. If you think both are the same, you clearly understand NOTHING about crypto whatsoever. The DAO hack and the hard fork took over a month to assess, propose solutions and resolve. It wasnt an overnight fix, like what solana is known for. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When Solana goes down - over night fix.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When bridge hacked? - overnight fix. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How long will Solana depend on overnight fixes to bail the network out?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Christ if traditional banking was this flakey the government would haul it over the coals and watch it burn.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yet people still invest in this centralized garbage. Litecoin for example (and I am sure there are many other examples that people can name) has had 100 percent uptime with literally no hacks or exploits, yet people label it as a deadcoin that is garbage.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It brings me to the conclusion that we don&amp;amp;#39;t really care about fundamentals in the crypto space, only juicy profits. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So it brings me back to the original point of this post, why an earth are people investing in SOL when it is the least secure and reliable chain in crypto?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
