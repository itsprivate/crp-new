Unlike previous exploits, this wasnt a flashloan or even carried out by a single group of attackers. After an initial attacker struck, hundreds of separate accounts figured out the trick and copy pasted their way into grabbing stolen funds. The bridge went from having $190,740,000 to $1,000 in a matter of hours. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/y9iefnch39f91.png?width=2340&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=7be815f3f62671372a127039c5718a7b478a5da1&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/y9iefnch39f91.png?width=2340&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=7be815f3f62671372a127039c5718a7b478a5da1&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A perplexing aspect of this vulnerability was that all users had to do to hack bridge funds was copy the original hacker&amp;amp;#39;s transaction calldata, replace the original address with a personal one, and the tx would succeed!  Easy as CTRL-C, CTRL-V!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However, not all of the thieves were bad. Some of them exploited the contract so other wouldnt be able to and planned to return the money back to nomad.  For example, leadingscientist.eth&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/fgzx6sks39f91.png?width=3557&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=ee8ebc64a48bde5f8d749c521188a36d6bced5ca&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/fgzx6sks39f91.png?width=3557&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=ee8ebc64a48bde5f8d749c521188a36d6bced5ca&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/g496z1dw39f91.png?width=1284&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=3eb0dbca21bfeb9d92ecd0a7573e6accce5cc867&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/g496z1dw39f91.png?width=1284&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=3eb0dbca21bfeb9d92ecd0a7573e6accce5cc867&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So all in all it was a messed up exploit but there were some nice people who plan to return the money. Faith in humanity restored maybe?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The old age saying of only put money into Crypto that you are prepared to lose is extremely valuable. This post will aim to give you a bit of an insight into how I became successful in day-trading crypto and give you some real examples of how I read the charts and try to minimize my risk. Day trading is not my only tactic, it took me years to get comfortable with a strategy that is successful so I’ll also hopefully give you some tips and tricks that will allow you to also get more familiar with the day trading concepts, but while minimizing your risk profile. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;My Crypto trading fundamentals&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These are some of my fundamental principles with crypto – again it’s not an exhaustive list and I’ve built this up over the years – but some of these set the foundation reasoning as to why I did what I did. Hopefully you’ll see some of the examples in my journey below – but if you want a tldr version of my most summary, then the below list is where to go.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Research every project you invest into – for 3+ months before you invest. If you cannot explain it in simple terms to a non-technical person (e.g. your Grandma) as why it’s a good investment and what the niche is – you didn’t do enough research or the project is just shit and should be avoided.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Do not touch leverage you fucking degenerate&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Make sure you have the keys / control your own crypto (the majority of your stack should be held offline, but you can trade some of your portfolio on a reputable exchange e.g. Coinbase/Kraken not some tiny shitty one with that has higher chance of going under)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Never FOMO – if you miss a spike and pump, you missed the boat to buy more. YOU CAN ONLY SELL into a spike, NEVER BUY. Likewise if the price drops, YOU CAN ONLY BUY into a dip, NEVER SELL.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;NEVER BUY back in higher than you sold for – even if that means holding fiat for months/years&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Get a strategy and stick to it – as in do not change your mind. You can continue to DCA, but only review your portfolio/strategy every 6-12 months and see if the landscape has changed and you want to do something differently.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Remember it is 100% impossible to perfectly time every single trade (unless you’re a whale with 1B+ in crypto assets that is a market maker). Do not get worried or panic that the price goes the wrong way – you cannot time it perfectly. You do not need to get every trade right – you do not aim for 100% perfection, you just aim to get more winners than losers.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Never sell at a loss! (There is a couple of exceptions to this – if you review your portfolio after 12 months and want to change into another project then this is ok. Also if your project goes into a death spiral (see LUNA) – then you’re better to get out with 5% of your portfolio than 0.001%)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Have multiple exchanges ready and with KYC completed – don’t just have 1 exchange that could have downtime during a big spike and leave you holding the bags.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Do not trade emotionally. Make sure it fits your strategy and principles&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Plan your exit strategy upfront so you can execute it without emotion – this is part of defining your strategy. Do not try to come up with your exit plan during the hype phase and chase the potential gains – you will never time it perfectly and chances are you fail to cash out enough. (Example strategy, for every x2, cash out 10% so you never lose your entire stack) &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Lambos are for noobs – when you get money for a super car you will not want to buy one. Porsche&amp;amp;#39;s are far better machines&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;I always want some exposure to crypto (never cash out 100% of the portfolio fully to fiat or stablecoin)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Do what the opposite of the market says – so check the fear and greed index. (It’s the same as the 2nd point above. Buy when it goes down and sell when it goes up.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/wu7c7zmhi6f91.png?width=594&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=547cf4a264d37d1eefc4d1f30ae0aaa8d35c2b6e&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/wu7c7zmhi6f91.png?width=594&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=547cf4a264d37d1eefc4d1f30ae0aaa8d35c2b6e&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Where it all started&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Living in the UK, my first exposure to crypto was mining Bitcoin back in 2012 at University. I joined a mining pool and mined maybe 0.5 BTC which was worth almost nothing, and it’s gone to live with the crypto gods in a landfill somewhere in the South-West. Then I did almost nothing for several years – not even really following crypto developments because I had absolutely no money to buy anything with. (I was a student that used any spare money for beer – I have absolutely no regrets) &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then at the beginning of 2018, I was encouraged to make my first big mistake in crypto. I was ‘advised’ by my step-father to invest in XRP, because it was almost a sure fire bet. I think I started to buy in on the way down around £0.90 and the price never recovered. What a brutal landing into crypto – I was almost dissuaded, but then I sat myself down and tried to plan out a longer term strategy that would be successful.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;DCA is your friend&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My average price was £0.90, on an XRP that was only going down. I was in a lucky position that I was still young (under 30) and being able to make investments while still having my own house (that was priority number 1 which is why I didn’t invest in crypto from 2012-2018 – ask yourself also should you invest in crypto if that money should be better spent elsewhere like a house / medication / car etc). My thought process was – lets go big or go home. If it all goes to 0 – I’m young enough that I can build up another portfolio for retirement. Many people don’t even start in their 20s so if it all goes tits up, I can start again with something safer like stocks in my early 30s.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So what did I do? DCA. Every damn month without fail, I was buying up XRP. I was not trying to spread my portfolio into many different projects (I was not researching much about crypto and to be honest, I cannot follow 10+ projects properly, I would rather follow one in more detail – again part of my own strategy. I wanted to understand what I am investing in)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/0hoob3aji6f91.png?width=601&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=699668d1109d3a981ddd7c5b7da153fa11fd72fc&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/0hoob3aji6f91.png?width=601&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=699668d1109d3a981ddd7c5b7da153fa11fd72fc&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;By the start of 2019 – my portfolio looked something like this, continuing to DCA, the portfolio value was increasing and just about made it to a goal of 100k XRP – I was pumped. My wife (gf at the time) was a little less amused, she didn’t understand this at all and thought I’m just throwing away money in &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Researching a backup plan&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So XRP didn’t have a great start, the price was going down and I managed to get my average price to €0.30. (Yes it’s euro’s now not £ – I moved to live in the Netherlands in 2019). I continued to DCA but I was starting to think that maybe XRP was not the only horse I should back in the crypto race. This is when I started to spend a lot more time researching other projects and getting to understand the fundamental differences and the terminology (PoW vs PoS etc). &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;2019 was where I made my riches, but I only continued to DCA into XRP. That doesn’t make any sense right? No, you’re wrong. RESEARCH! It is so damn important, the average investor is dumb as a brick and there is so much stupid money in the financial markets its insane. (Don’t get started on DOGE or TESLA stock – but they are prime examples where things are worth way more than they should – it defies logic).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I was reading up about new projects and trying to find the new project that could come good – I didn’t want a super high risk micro cap that had a big change of going to 0, but also I didn’t want to bet on the big 2… BTC or ETH. So I looked at Coingecko and my strategy was to find a good project that had promise in the top 30. Let’s take a look at the crypto market cap ranking from the end of 2019:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/ckuzn7kki6f91.png?width=602&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=0c432f6f2c64853dba2535048ffb0ff4894dce35&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/ckuzn7kki6f91.png?width=602&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=0c432f6f2c64853dba2535048ffb0ff4894dce35&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Not all of these projects lived up to their hype – many have come and gone but some have stood the test of time. I was looking for something that would still be around in 3-4 years and ad the potential for more explosive gains. (Logically it seemed less likely to me that BTC would go x10 compared to say Monero which was ranked 16).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So I spent most of 2019 researching up on projects and getting to find their project communities. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;This is a key point&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; – facts and news are hard to come by in crypto. The best source you can get is from the project itself where you believe you can trust them (there are scam projects and rug pulls of course – if they sound too good to be true then it probably is). But do not rely on crypto news outlets or YouTube shills to give you your crypto news. It’s 2nd hand information and you also receive the info after other people have bought in – they are unloading their bags on you… Don’t be a mug – see fundamental point 2.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;My first portfolio rebalancing&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So 2019 has come and gone, I’ve been researching crypto and start to understand a bit more about projects. (I can understand and explain in simple English what the top 15 projects are trying to do, and explain the advantages/disadvantages). XRP was going nowhere and I decided, I’m going to change my strategy. So I sold my XRP and bought ADA. I cannot remember the specifics of what I got out at on XRP, but I had about 100k tokens from DCA and went 100% into ADA and continued to DCA. My average buy in for ADA at the half way point of 2020 was about €0.06.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Why Cardano? It seemed like a well funded project that was doing things the right way and I had confidence they would be around in 3-4 years and the risk vs reward looked actually in my favour. (Risk was medium with a good potential – at least that’s how I viewed it). Again I’m still prepared to lose everything, but I see that from 2020, ADA looks like it has a brighter future than XRP and it’s time that I eat some humble pie and change direction.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I did not FOMO and change my strategy when things were not going great with XRP at the drop of a hat, I took my time and made sure I had a solid strategy and logic behind my next move. The biggest fuck up crypto and especially day-traders will do is panic and try to ‘get back their losses’. The past is done and in the past – you can only change the future direction you’re going in so do not get emotional and hold onto the ‘what if’. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;PLAN YOU NEXT MOVE AND STICK TO THE PLAY!&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Staking&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is not written as an ADA shill, but the big reason I went into Cardano was that I liked their PoS model (there were other projects that had this potential so I could have chosen another, but this is what I picked). Cardano with PoS seemed much fairer than PoW and much more energy efficient. I have to be honest – compound interest is what really got me. At 5% returns per year – you can double your investment within 14 years. TIME IS WHERE YOU MAKE YOUR MONEY with compound interest, set it and forget it!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/17zucy3mi6f91.png?width=602&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=b350cb79b78b26759b4783b9d12f74dc20c0684e&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/17zucy3mi6f91.png?width=602&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=b350cb79b78b26759b4783b9d12f74dc20c0684e&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The saying of ‘look after the pennies and the pounds look after themselves’ seems like something your Grandma tells you with her words of wisdom – but this is how pension funds make their big gains over longer time periods. This is why I love staking and think it’s a legit way to accumulate more tokens. If the price remains stable then you’re happy earning rewards! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Following market pairs&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Staking after a year and continuing to DCA.. My ADA portfolio was growing. The price was also starting to increase and ended 2020 at around €0.20 – I was now up on my €0.06 average and a bit happier – my perseverance and strategy was starting to pay off. DCA during that bad years of 2018 and 2019 had grown my portfolio in terms of fiat, but then the switch to ADA was what made this play successful.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Tracking market pairs is really important – when it comes to rebalancing your portfolio it is probably one of the most important metrics to look at. I do not like looking at the charts of each token in USD or EUR because they often are pretty correlated, I want to see the strength of 2 projects side by side, so make sure you follow the charts of a specific pair! See XRP/ADA example&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/v21hzkmni6f91.png?width=602&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=3aacfe2d3825a163383309732080e6b5ad545101&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/v21hzkmni6f91.png?width=602&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=3aacfe2d3825a163383309732080e6b5ad545101&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Day trading doesn’t seem that difficult?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Day trading seems so easy right? But the stats seem to suggest that 90% of day traders lose money. They are correct – most people fail with fundamentals and panic. They rush into something and FOMO or invest in something they don’t understand. Following some of my fundamentals above should help you combat some of this – but again it is not easy. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How did I start? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Well, for the end of 2020 and beginning of 2021, the price of ADA continued to go up but staking and DCA was getting a bit boring. I wanted to look into getting alternative methods to increase my stack and I was getting more confident in crypto having spent longer here. I wanted to dabble with day trading but I was a bit concerned I could lose money and wanted to ‘test the waters’ before I jumped in with both feet.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So I started to manually track what trades I would make based on the current price in excel. I never actually made the trades – but I would say to myself, this is a prime selling opportunity – lets play around with selling 5% of my ADA stack and trying to buy it a bit lower to increase our token amount. I’d then manually say to myself – ok this seems like a nice time to buy back in and would manually input into excel what I would have made, and I did this for 6 months without even trading anything!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then the moment came – after being successful in trading (hypothetically of course) the time came to put my money where my mouth is and start to trade with my own money. This is psychologically a big barrier to overcome and will test your nerve – but you need to have the stone cold killer mindset. This is just you executing a plan and strategy without emotion – you do not FOMO. You simply look at the charts/numbers and if they tell you to sell, you sell.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;My day trading principles&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These principles are on top of the crypto fundamentals I listed above&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You can only day trade when the market is volatile – so if it isn’t right it isn’t right. You cannot force it. I can day trade multiple times a day for several weeks in a row then go for a month or 6 weeks without day trading anything! I never try to force anything and only make the trade when my gut says this ticks all of the boxes &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Sell into pumps – market wide pumps or project specific is fine. (Project specific pumps can last longer than market wide pumps on a day trading scale – so you need to check the rest of the market. If your project is up 15% and the entire market is flat – maybe check a bit more into why this is happening and time your exit over the day (read this as DCA out))&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Set yourself a maximum amount of your portfolio that you will cash out into pumps (e.g. Lets say I hold 100k ADA, I will only ever max sell 20k in 5k increments as the price keeps going up – if it continues to go up then I hold the remaining 80k and wait to rebuy. If the price never comes back down – then I’ve just taken profit on the way up and hopefully it’ll be pennies in comparison if it is a legit moon shot and you won’t feel so bad)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Check the volume and order book for your project on your exchange! See what the support levels look like (if there is a big wall at a psychological level e.g. 20k for BTC – probably it bounces off – so it’s an ideal selling opportunity to buy back lower) – if the trading volume if high on a specific day – then it’s a great opportunity to dump your bags and buy back in cheaper1&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Do not try to time your buy back in to be perfect – you won’t catch it at the fullest extent of the dip. For my tactic – I refuse to buy back in without making 2% on an individual flip – with the aim to complete this 4-5 times in a day if the markets are volatile – trading on 15 min charts. (The project can start and end the day at the same level but if can flip 2-3 times then I am growing my stack while the market is relatively flat). I personally, will go for bare minimum 2% on a flip, but can be upto 15% if the market tanks. I’m not holding fiat for long max 1 day if the markets are going down but also if the price continues to go up – I’ll sit and hold for as long as it takes to buy back in even if that takes months (again I only sell max 20% on my stack in smaller increments) – I am not looking to time it perfect and do not think in fiat terms. I think about how much of my ADA I was able to get each trade.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Build yourself a tracker in excel where you can track your trades and give yourself some perspective on how you are getting along – bonus points if you build yourself out a compound interest calculator &amp;amp;amp; exit strategy into it to.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;I only make trades when I can manually do them myself when I am awake – meaning I do not set limit orders. I want to be in a position to make the trade myself and reach the market sentiment and charts – again this strategy might hinder me – but it’s what I’m comfortable with. (Only exception to this can be setting a real low buy price and hope some idiot fat fingers a trade – these tend to happen maybe once every 3 months on Kraken/Coinbase for lower liquidity projects and you can hoover up free money this way – best fuckup someone ever made for me gave me 5k free ADA lol)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Always have a small % of fiat available to buy a ‘black swan’ type of event – or a big unexpected dip. I don’t believe crypto will disappear but I always have some fiat on hand separate from my normal day trading money ready in the event the market turns bad and you see 40% discounts across the board in a single day.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;2021 – the year of ATHs&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;2021 was incredibly and absolutely life changing. I managed to execute my exit strategy and buy myself a nice house and Porsche GT3. Pic of the beast for those car enthusiasts: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/z7n5mh53dnt71.jpg?width=960&amp;amp;amp;crop=smart&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=ea7ff4d2c4cad3ae1522c434a954c58f35030736&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/z7n5mh53dnt71.jpg?width=960&amp;amp;amp;crop=smart&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=ea7ff4d2c4cad3ae1522c434a954c58f35030736&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I cashed out max 50% of my stack and continued to stake, DCA and day-trade. Getting to a point where at the end of 2021 I had traded over $40m in volume and a net worth of over 7 figures. It’s absolutely unthinkable to me that this was possible and I still pinch myself to this day – all of this is not real and just numbers in an app somewhere until you cash out. Life is too short and you can get hit by a bus tomorrow – make sure you do take advantage and cash out some of your profits (even if you’re a little crypto shrimp and that is taking your partner out for dinner instead of buying a house) – get something out of it! If crypto goes to 0 – you better be damn sure you come out of it better than you went in.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The second portfolio rebalancing&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;ADA had given me incredible returns, with a DCA in and a DCA out – for the profits I was taking I was up x25. It was time to start planning my next portfolio rebalancing. I’m always continually researching and reading up on crypto – so I already had an idea on where my next project could be (I’ll mentally have a top 5 other projects that I would invest in to be prepared). In the summer of 2021 I decided to exit my ADA position and move into LRC – where I remain with 100% of my position until this date without taking any further profits. I continue to day trade successfully albeit with lower volumes because the market is not pumping.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Where do I think I can improve my own strategy?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is a difficult one – but probably having a better strategy for bear markets. I do great selling into pumps – but if the market is going down, I only have so much fiat to be able to buy the dip. I will continue to DCA but I should be looking at the MACD trends and be able to accumulate more on the down trends. I could improve this by cashing out more on the bench and waiting for a longer dip to take place – but I get anxious with less crypto exposure. (I do not want to miss the pump). Therefore one of my strategies is to make sure I never cash out all of my crypto – only small %’s at a time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also as my portfolio grows even more – I should start to invest into other projects and split the risk rather than going 100% in one project (I know this – but I do not have sufficient time with a toddler and work to research 5+ projects sufficiently enough and stay up to date with the news)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I hope my journey was an interesting read and you maybe learned something new. My journey is far from over and my biggest advice is to just plan and research your own strategies that you can execute. If you do this – then you are much more likely to be non-emotional when it comes to trading and that is where a large amount of the 90% of failed day-traders go wrong.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Whenever NFTs are brought up people question what real world problems they can solve.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I think there is a huge use case that is not really achievable with any other existing technology and that is a proof of ownership of real world, physical items. Some companies are already utilising this, such as Tiffany &amp;amp;amp; Co. announcing their NFTiff NFTs that sell for whopping 30 ETH a pop and can be redeemed for a custom, physical piece of jewelry.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There&amp;amp;#39;s also StockX which uses NFTs as a proof of ownership of physical shoes. The NFTs can be redeemed at any time for a pair of the actual shoes from the StockX vault. This solves many problems because hyped shoes are being scalped in bulk and shipped around the world many times as they are being re-sold. NFTs can single-handedly remove all problems that this currently has:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;No need to ship the physical box around - this reduces emissions and make it more eco friendly&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Makes flipping way easier for both the buyer and the seller&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Reasonable royalty fees guarantee that the creator still gets paid on resales (this is very useful for concert tickets in my opinion - which are also scalped and re-sold at 3x the price)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Completely removes fakes from the market &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Btc is up 4.65% in seven days.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Eth is up 6.28% in seven days.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Other signs that confirm the bull run of 2022 had started.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fomo has returned. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Regret of not buying Eth at $800 is mentioned frequently.   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitcoin to 100k by end of year comments are back.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Scammers have started sending DMs again.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s official Bull run of 2022 has started and if you don&amp;amp;#39;t know, now you know.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The problem is far too vast during the bull market; I guess we have to accept that sort of thing is allowed.  But now?  During the great bear?  This is our one moment of peace and respite.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Let us have it.  Fuck off shills.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We&amp;amp;#39;re in a bear market. Shit sucks. But that doesn&amp;amp;#39;t mean we can&amp;amp;#39;t still have some fun right?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For  those that were around at the beginning of the year, you might remember  that I created this. The FOLIO OF HATE. I invested (yolo&amp;amp;#39;d?) $100 into this subs most hated coins. Some coins are hated because of utility,  some because of corruption, some because of the the shills. Whatever the reason, I decided to act on the theory that this sub can actually pick  winners by investing into the ones that we all hate the most.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So, $100 was invested on the same day to each of the ten coins/tokens. Here is how it has fared.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/mll6gghpcue91.png?width=979&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=1af27826e7183ea80040397286f7986ea196a335&quot;&amp;gt;Folio of Hate&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Down 60% or $600 in eight months.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What about the individual results? Surely they&amp;amp;#39;re not all bad? Right?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Best performer:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; USDT -0.06 %&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Worst performer:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; LRC -81.05 %&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Surprise Performer:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; BNB -46.23%&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/xjc4bfzucue91.png?width=945&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=386dc9f14842095519d45d27091836d26b5b77a5&quot;&amp;gt; Folio of Hate Individual Performance&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Despite the savagery of the capitulation and bear market, there are some interesting observations.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Personal points of interest:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Binance is the best none-stablecoin performer. This could be connected to the collapse of other exchanges/lenders.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Investing in Dogecoin - was a better investment than top guns Solana and Cardano.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Solana performed equally as bad as Safemoon &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Tether - FUCKING TETHER - was the folios best performer. Props to &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/u/entschida/&quot;&amp;gt;u/entschida&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; for getting that one right.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I  am aware that perceptions and opinions shift over time, so it is of course possible that we hate these coins more than ever. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Finally, the sentiment for crypto.com (or Cronos) has drastically shifted over the past eight months. If I were to create this folio today, CDC would definitely have a place in it. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here is a break down of what exactly Pure Proof of Stake is and why it is unique:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/dx1ea20cire91.jpg?width=680&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=395b52cbfa4f77534ad7a6ccc8b4d5a06a51fe46&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/dx1ea20cire91.jpg?width=680&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=395b52cbfa4f77534ad7a6ccc8b4d5a06a51fe46&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Block Proposal:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Accounts propose new blocks to the network&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Soft Vote:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Committee votes on proposals and filters down to one&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Certify Vote:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Separate committee votes to certify the block&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Each node receives a certificate for the block and writes it to the ledger&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;New round is initiated and process starts over with new block proposers and voters&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Algorand blockchain uses a decentralized Byzantine agreement protocol based on pure proof-of-stake (PPoS). It can tolerate an arbitrary number of malicious users as long as honest users (those that follow the instructions of the protocol) hold more than two-thirds of the total stake in the system. The following is a brief overview of the Algorand protocol.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Protocol Participation&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In Algorand, every online user who possesses algos can participate in the consensus protocol. To reduce exposure, users do not use their spending keys (i.e., the keys they use to spend stake) for consensus. Instead, a user who wishes to participate in the protocol generates and registers a participation key. With this key, an account can participate in proposing and voting on blocks. Using participation keys ensures that a user&amp;amp;#39;s algos are secure even if their participating node is compromised.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;Self-Selection via Verifiable Random Function&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Every block in Algorand reveals a new random and unpredictable selection seed that determines which users should participate in the next round of the consensus protocol. When a new block gets committed to the blockchain, everyone becomes aware of this seed (and everyone sees the same seed). A user secretly checks whether they were selected to participate by evaluating a Verifiable Random Function (VRF) with their secret participation key and the selection seed. This computation is minimal, so even a limited device such as a Raspberry Pi can do it. The VRF computation produces a pseudorandom output with a cryptographic proof that anyone can use to verify the result. By sending this proof, a user can prove to anyone that they were indeed selected to participate.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;Pure Proof-of-Stake&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What makes this protocol pure proof-of-stake is the fact that users are chosen to participate in the protocol based on the stake (number of algos) that they have. The VRF behaves similarly to a weighted lottery; it is as if every algo in an account gets its own lottery ticket. The more algos in an online account, the better chance the account has of being selected to participate.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;User Replaceability&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The selection of users to participate in the certification of blocks using the VRF is done randomly and secretly, without any communication among the users. Since executing this procedure requires a user’s private key, no one except for that user knows whether they were selected. An adversary does not know who matters in generating the next block (and thus should be targeted) until after a selected user participates in the consensus protocol. And by the time an adversary realizes that a user is selected, it is too late for them to benefit from an attack; the user has already sent their message and fulfilled their responsibility in the consensus protocol. Furthermore, for each step of the protocol a unique subset of participants is randomly and privately selected, independent of earlier subsets.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;Achieving Consensus&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Consensus refers to the way blocks are selected and written to the blockchain. Algorand uses the VRF described above to select accounts to propose blocks for a given round. When a block is proposed to the blockchain, a committee of voters is selected to vote on the block proposal. If a super majority of the votes are from honest participants, the block can be certified.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Consensus requires three steps to propose, confirm, and write a block to the blockchain: 1) propose, 2) soft vote, and 3) certify vote. Each is described below, assuming the ideal case when there are no malicious users and the network is not partitioned (i.e., none of the network is down due to technical issues or from DoS attacks).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;Block Proposal&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the block proposal step, accounts are selected to propose new blocks to the network. This phase starts with every node in the network looping through each of the accounts that it manages and, for each account that is online and participating, running Algorand’s VRF to determine if the account is selected to propose the block. Once an account is selected, each node propagates its proposed block along with the VRF output, which proves that the account is a valid proposer. Each node in the network will get block proposals from other nodes, and then validate the VRF output for these proposals.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;Soft Vote&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Next, each node will run the VRF for every participating account it manages to see if they have been chosen to participate in the soft vote committee. If an account is chosen, it will have a weighted vote based on the number of algos it has. Each account chosen will filter the proposals down to one by voting to confirm the block. These votes will be for the lowest VRF block proposal calculated at the timeout and will be sent out to the other nodes along with the VRF proof. Each node will validate the committee membership VRF proof before adding to the vote tally. Once a quorum is reached for the soft vote, the process moves to the certify vote step.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;Certify Vote&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A new committee is then selected to check the block proposal that was voted on in the soft vote phase for overspending, double-spending, or any other problems. If valid, the committee votes again to certify the block. This is done in a similar manner to the soft vote where each node iterates through its managed accounts to select a committee and to send votes. These votes are collected and validated by each node until a quorum is reached, triggering an end to the round and prompting the node to create a certificate for the block and write it to the ledger. At that point, a new round is initiated and the process starts over.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/oteo2v9iire91.jpg?width=1282&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=9f54b0c63e767bb05c72b4a7f9d93cfc047a1eff&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/oteo2v9iire91.jpg?width=1282&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=9f54b0c63e767bb05c72b4a7f9d93cfc047a1eff&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;People tend to unfairly criticize Algorand&amp;amp;#39;s tokenomics so here is an exact break down:&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;10 Billion MAX SUPPLY (There will never be more).&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;7 Billion ALREADY IN CIRCULATION (70% are already owned).&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;3 Billion left to be released, the only way to obtain them is via Governance until 2030.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Yearly inflation is around 3.7% until 2030, when Algorand will become deflationary.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;TLDR:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Nobody knows where crypto will be in a week, a month, or a year from now. Timing tops and bottoms is how novices approach the market. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Rule of thumb:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; buy things going up in price. Sell things going down. Change course when the trend has reversed. This simple approach got me out of crypto late last year and has me back in since last week. I listen to charts, not headlines. Cause bad news is good, unless good news is good, then bad news is bad (except when good news is bad).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Let&amp;amp;#39;s travel back in time so we can get a glimpse into the future:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Very few retail investors got out when the signals were flashing at $60k. How could anyone sell when we&amp;amp;#39;re headed to $100k by end of 2021, right?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;[1] @$69k&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; - &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;$100k here we come!!!&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;[2] @$60k&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; - &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;ll take some profit when we pump back to $69k&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;[3] @$50k&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; - &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Should&amp;amp;#39;ve sold at $60k, too late to sell now&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;[4] @$40k&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; - &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Since I&amp;amp;#39;m still in, might as well buy some here at 40% off! We&amp;amp;#39;re headed back to ATH anyways!&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;[5] @$30k&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; - &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Bitcoin is down more than half since the highs. Can&amp;amp;#39;t exit now when I just added at $40k&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;[6] @$20k&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; - &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;$15k is gonna be the bottom. I&amp;amp;#39;ll sell a little bit now and get back in later&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;[7] @$25k&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; - &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Whale manipulation. I don&amp;amp;#39;t trust this rally: it&amp;amp;#39;s a trap!&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/g8cofjq0eqe91.png?width=863&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=7fc130619db6cfc322a5945640db5b2a35ee3e0b&quot;&amp;gt;Current Bitcoin Bear Market - Nov 2021 to Present&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You see what happened there? &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Sunk cost fallacy combined with making predictions about the future&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. It&amp;amp;#39;s difficult to think rationally when you&amp;amp;#39;re drunk off the euphoria of a parabolic run-up. And even harder when you&amp;amp;#39;re underwater and sitting on heavy losses. The market can leave you in denial. Or worst, lamenting that something different could&amp;amp;#39;ve been done to change your current situation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;The market is never obvious. It is designed to fool most of the people, most of the time.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
-Jesse Livermore, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;GOAT trader&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Nobody Knows S*** About F***&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some guesses are more educated than others. As I alluded to in previous posts, it is beneficial to know how institutional speculators approach the market. Their #1 job is to manage risk. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Preservation of capital&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; is paramount: it supersedes &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;return on capital&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These professionals take calculated bets and cut losses when they are wrong. When they are right, they let their winners run or add to the position. This requires a plan; it involves setting profit targets and exit prices. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;It means changing your opinion when the market presents you with new information.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Professionals don&amp;amp;#39;t dig-in when a theory is invalidated; they pivot and look for the next opportunity.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Compare that to novices who aren&amp;amp;#39;t formally trained in navigating the markets. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The desire for profit blinds them from protecting against losses&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. To the moon or bust! Cutting their winners short and letting their losers run. Not using stops or not taking profits. Adding to losing positions. Being stubborn, FOMO, fear, greed, and emotions are what drives their decision making. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;It is the polar opposite of how smart money thinks and acts.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;The Power of Inversion&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Let&amp;amp;#39;s flip the story from above as a thought experiment:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Very few retail investors got in when the signals were flashing at $20k. How could anyone buy when we&amp;amp;#39;re headed to $10k by end of 2022, right?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;[7] @$17k&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; - &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;$10k Here we come!!!&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;[6] @$25k&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; - &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;ll buy the dip when we dump back to $20k&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;[5] @$30k&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; - &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Should&amp;amp;#39;ve bought at $25k, too late to buy now&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;[4] @$35k&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; - &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Since I&amp;amp;#39;m still in, might as well sell some here at +100% run-up! We&amp;amp;#39;re headed back to the bottom anyways!&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;[3] @$40k&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; - &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Bitcoin is up more than double since the lows. Can&amp;amp;#39;t buy now when I just sold some back at $35k&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;[2] @$45k&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; - &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;$50k is gonna be the top. I&amp;amp;#39;ll buy a little bit now and take profit later&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;[1] @$40k&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; - &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Whale manipulation. I won&amp;amp;#39;t be shaken out: diamond hands!&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/zvw7nlr1eqe91.png?width=860&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=2b368671d8c5d1dd4f681d681ff54ab7b1c1764e&quot;&amp;gt;Prior Bitcoin Bull Run - Jan 2020 to Dec 2021&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;An uptrend is simply the opposite of a downtrend. Recall: &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;The market is never obvious. It is designed to fool most of the people, most of the time.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Rinse and Repeat&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;I own long-term investments older than members of this sub&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. I&amp;amp;#39;ve been in this game long enough to witness more market cycles than I can remember.  Dot Com Bubble, housing, banks, gold, oil, cannabis stocks, shipping, pandemic stocks, etc. They all came and went. Crypto is no different; it is not special. It&amp;amp;#39;s just more volatile and trades 24/7: that&amp;amp;#39;s why Wall Street loves it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The price of an asset goes up and down because humans behave in the manner demonstrated above (anecdotally). This phenomenon--called the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Market Cycle&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, is a story as old as the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_mania&quot;&amp;gt;Dutch Tulip Bubble of the 1600s&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. Professionals (i.e., institutions and whales) prey on this fact. That&amp;amp;#39;s why they do the exact opposite of retail. Diagrams below were done in MS Paint since I wasted all my crayons doing TA (and snacking on).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/y6gm2jx5eqe91.png?width=790&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=954af3398057c9fb8cf2b65e3d0b998be9e605b1&quot;&amp;gt;Price is trending higher and higher. Institutions are buying. Professionals buy the dip; Novices short the uptrend or buy too late.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Note:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; I am aware that most retail investors can&amp;amp;#39;t or don&amp;amp;#39;t short. The above depiction applies more to trading than investing--but you get the idea. Main Street is late to the party and/or going against the trend.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/pe5vi2w6eqe91.png?width=790&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=256151862c832dfab08326c5c110428323091698&quot;&amp;gt;Price is going lower and lower. Institutions are selling. Professionals short the rallies; Novices buy the downtrend or sell too late.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;A Timeless Approach for Viewing Markets&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Institutions have the ability to profit when price is moving in either direction. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;More importantly, they have the capital required to create and sustain a trending market&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. Whales swim with the current and so should you. This is why it pays to identify which market phase/stage we&amp;amp;#39;re in. That would require a bit of analysis... of the technical variety... &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Technical Analysis&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, you could say. I don&amp;amp;#39;t mean studying astrology or watching squiggly lines intersect. I mean the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Classic Market Cycle&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;: it is an objective framework for analyzing asset prices.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/cl42x8y9eqe91.png?width=812&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=9544e98adf8f2375ac96ea46f998450ff734153b&quot;&amp;gt;Four Stages of the Market Cycle. Exists on all timeframes and represents human emotion&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the same way that you respect the downtrend when it is active, you should respect the uptrend once it confirms itself. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The market pays you to react, not to predict&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. Quit wanting to be right. Stop trying to impress others with your forecasts. Why do you think YouTubers and Influencers get so much attention? Nobody is clairvoyant--unfollow the Furu&amp;amp;#39;s. Everything you need to know about the crypto market is right in front of your face. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Crypto investors stare at charts all day anyways; that time would be better spent learning how to read them objectively.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;For Anyone Who Scrolled This Far&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You&amp;amp;#39;re probably asking what&amp;amp;#39;s the point of all my lengthy posts recently? &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m not on Reddit for karma&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. My goal is to spark some minds into taking control of their financial future. There are benefits in studying how markets behave. Learning to read charts can be a valuable tool for your investment strategy. It can help guide your decisions on &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;when to enter, add, take profits, and exit&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; on whichever timeframe matters to you.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you don&amp;amp;#39;t have the desire or time for that, then continue on with DCA. There&amp;amp;#39;s a good reason why it is the recommended approach for passive investment. Just know that &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;investors who don&amp;amp;#39;t manage risk end up losing more than traders. Traders who don&amp;amp;#39;t manage risk end up becoming long-term investors (bagholders).&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

He premined ethereum, and gave himself/the dev team close to 12M ethereum. Here is the wallet &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://etherscan.io/address/0xde0b295669a9fd93d5f28d9ec85e40f4cb697bae&quot;&amp;gt;link&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and evidence of the wallet being funded with 12M eth 2547 days ago.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/8ilydapzlpe91.png?width=1087&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=84183870f726b82864aff56bbb89276e37f629d1&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/8ilydapzlpe91.png?width=1087&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=84183870f726b82864aff56bbb89276e37f629d1&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Lets show you guys an example of the wallet dumping eth. On May 17th 2021, the wallet transferred 35k eth to another wallet.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/ud3nmme1mpe91.png?width=1308&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=edc035389f0e5b964e37335bebee52f613318ac6&quot;&amp;gt;This is the transaction&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Lets have a guess what the wallet does next? Anyone want to guess? Yep, straight out to kraken to use you guys as his exit liquidity.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/7uh4yo84mpe91.png?width=1301&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=34a45097c9f350e8e60332df8f2c8381202b5643&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/7uh4yo84mpe91.png?width=1301&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=34a45097c9f350e8e60332df8f2c8381202b5643&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The next dump gets even better. November 11,2021 the ethdev waller transfers 20K ether out to the same wallet, which then again transfers it to Kraken where they dump it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/ej58eg76mpe91.png?width=1297&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=b573a5b07658ff9686933ede168cd54ebe4160a1&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/ej58eg76mpe91.png?width=1297&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=b573a5b07658ff9686933ede168cd54ebe4160a1&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/8a2txow7mpe91.png?width=1298&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=b59e02b01314e72e88858d266586179f921c2e8b&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/8a2txow7mpe91.png?width=1298&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=b59e02b01314e72e88858d266586179f921c2e8b&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now this is where things get interesting. Guess what day the bull market ended? Nov 8,2021.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/akhmf7l9mpe91.png?width=1126&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=9d6f005ec99876a9442343746331e149a84279d1&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/akhmf7l9mpe91.png?width=1126&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=9d6f005ec99876a9442343746331e149a84279d1&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I do hold eth and like it, but I think its fair to give eth the same criticism as we would all give to other shitcoins if the owners or VCs sell this much. Its up to you guys to decide if he timed the market to perfection, or he created the eth top and used you guys as exit liquidity. I think its pretty obvious.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

My whole portfolio was in a Celsius earn account and one day they froze withdrawals and that was that. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The portfolio I had built up for years was swept away from me more or less. Thousands of people lost thousands of dollars. I have pretty much given up hope on those coins returning and yet I feel ok.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Since it happened a lot of people fall into this depression, psychosis, rage, and despair. I never thought it was that deep. I lost a lot of money. But I can’t do anything to change the outcome.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Why should I lose sleep over something I literally cannot fix. When it happened I was frustrated for about and day and then realized ok fine, time to start new.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I am young and I have time let’s start from scratch. And so here I am rebuilding my portfolio piece by piece. DCA by DCA.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I think always taking up hobbies can distract you from trying times as well. Much like beating drug addiction the best way is to replace the thoughts with a hobby. I hang with friends or workout or rock climb to distract myself from constant bad news which is easy to find nowadays.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It’s not the end of the world it’s just money and it can be rebuilt. It’s unfortunate but not the end of the line.
To anyone else who lost it all take it from me losing your mind over it won’t help you get your money up.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
