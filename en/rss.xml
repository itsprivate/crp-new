&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Silence&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Me: The following: Imagine investing 100€ in Ethereum. The price goes up by 20%. Now I have 120€. If I now sell and buy again - and disregard the transaction fees - and the price rises again by 20%, I am at 144€. If I had not sold, it would have risen by 40% and I would only have 140€. Understand?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;LOUD SILENCE IN THE DISCORD CHAT&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Friend 1: Is it just me who thinks this is incredibly stupid?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Friend 2,3,4: No Nope Nah, that makes absolutely no sense &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I (slowly despairing🥲), think to myself that I could have saved the transaction fees, which are astronomical with Coinbase anyway, for one thing, and that from now on the story will be held in front of me again and again if I don&amp;amp;#39;t manage to clarify it now. So I try to explain the thing again and already during this I realize that it sounds really dumb.
My friends laugh at me and I cry (mentally).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The first and probably most specific to crypto is that he wasn&amp;amp;#39;t against stablecoins continuing to exist even if they began to issue a CBDC USD-meaning there&amp;amp;#39;s less of a threat that stablecoins would suddenly collapse from a ban which would be very destabilizing for the crypto ecosystem.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The second was that he (in passing) spoke of likely allowing bonds to expire off but he specified that this would probably be towards the end of the year-so this is basically quantitative tightening since they wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t be continuing to hold the same amount of bonds since they wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t be buying any more. I think there was some fear originally that they would start doing the rate hikes plus tightening all at once in March.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Of course overall he&amp;amp;#39;s still talking about planning for at least 3 hikes this year plus the tightening so it&amp;amp;#39;s not like he went all out in favor of easy money, but basically it wasn&amp;amp;#39;t the worst case scenario that was driving a lot of fear in recent days.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now I guess we wait patiently for the CPI numbers tomorrow-the two bullish scenarios for Bitcoin would be either lower than expected numbers causing the Fed to reduce the number of hikes or further delay tightening, or if the numbers are so freaking crazy that people think the Fed cannot control inflation at all. That said, I don&amp;amp;#39;t think either are particularly super likely scenarios. If it comes in about what everyone is expecting or a little bit hotter then they&amp;amp;#39;ll hike rates and tighten as planned. Whether that really is going to further impact Bitcoin is unclear-we&amp;amp;#39;re already down 40% and while we&amp;amp;#39;ve drawn down 80% in the past it&amp;amp;#39;s also a much more mature asset class now and there&amp;amp;#39;s global exposure so it&amp;amp;#39;s not solely US policy driving price.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TL;DR: Powell said stablecoins A-OK, will still hike rates soon but likely tightening not until Q3-Q4. Not worst case scenario feared.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;ve watched on-chain data for years. I&amp;amp;#39;d argue that currently, it&amp;amp;#39;s the most bullish I&amp;amp;#39;ve ever seen it, and the micro backdrop looks the same. I&amp;amp;#39;m calling for $500k in the next 12 months. Longterm holders are in a longterm uptrend, while short-term holders are in a longterm downtrend. When you consider the halving we had in 2020 (which means only 6.25 coinbase per block), the rise of commercial mining (which means huge amounts of HODL&amp;amp;#39;ed bitcoin), the parabolic growth of the LN (which means ever increasing amounts of BTC locked in nodes), the explosion of hard wallets (Trezor will give you 13% off if you wait to buy yours, and Ledger tripled its capacity), the possibility of spot ETF&amp;amp;#39;s (which means pension, IRA, and institutional exposure), that 90% of all BTC has already been mined  (the last 10% will take over 100 years to mine), etcetera, there&amp;amp;#39;s not much time left until we reach the counterpoint. That&amp;amp;#39;s where governments, financial institutions, and wealthy families late to the inevitability compete for the last large tracts of UTXO space on the blockchain, and bring the type of volatility the gold/papiermark enjoyed, before bitcoin&amp;amp;#39;s transactional (currency) epoch arrives:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/dtjkna3cb6b81.png?width=601&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=3c5a310fb1c2c31678582e086a9bd05b54236542&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/dtjkna3cb6b81.png?width=601&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=3c5a310fb1c2c31678582e086a9bd05b54236542&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On the micro side, all the publicly listed bitcoin companies (miners, FinCen etcetera), are at exhausted RSI&amp;amp;#39;s and trading at or below 52-week lows. The perp funding rates are negative. Futures ETF&amp;amp;#39;s have been in a consistent downtrend since November. The fear and greed index reached multi-year lows two days ago. Too, the massive amount of Asian selling is drying up (Huobi alone dumped 350k coins over the last quarter and several exchanges dumped all their Chinese customers). But you&amp;amp;#39;d never know any of this from the story on-chain data is trying to tell us that dumb money isn&amp;amp;#39;t heeding:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/stqgygmyb6b81.jpg?width=1800&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=78ae90722bc8c98455aef5e353d922f4e7a49591&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/stqgygmyb6b81.jpg?width=1800&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=78ae90722bc8c98455aef5e353d922f4e7a49591&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/p7bjjtv7c6b81.jpg?width=640&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=a10a5ca31e4c4e6028b53172221bd5f3649bf758&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/p7bjjtv7c6b81.jpg?width=640&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=a10a5ca31e4c4e6028b53172221bd5f3649bf758&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So for me, I&amp;amp;#39;m going to follow the subtext, and not listen to the noise. I&amp;amp;#39;m going to trust the math. I&amp;amp;#39;m going all-in with my dip money which I usually keep at 5% of my BTC holdings. I&amp;amp;#39;ll do so un-hedged, and prepare a loan on my BTC in the event one of the below FUD&amp;amp;#39;s drives us down briefly.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;FINAL FUD&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There are 3 potential FUD&amp;amp;#39;s this year, and after, there won&amp;amp;#39;t be anymore, ever.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Regulation. This will obliterate altcoins and almost all stablecoins.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Mt. Gox distribution date&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Russian invasion of Ukraine. This could spike energy prices, clobber mining&amp;amp;#39;s economy of scale, and force distribution of several miner&amp;amp;#39;s holdings to pay overhead. Kazakhstan produces energy at .04-.05 cents per kWh, which is about the cheapest in the world and has 20% of the hash power for example. Adding .01 to that is extremely severe.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitcoin will pivot off all of this quickly.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And as much as they are supporters of cryptocurrencies, 99% of people do it to have more money in fiat currencies so they can achieve their goals.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When trading with cryptocurrencies, we compare their value with the euro, dollar, pound, etc.  Currently we are comparing the value of everything to our current fiat price.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;An international financial system such as crypto takes time to adapt and I can only imagine what awaits us in the future, but I belive that even then we will still compare value with traditional currencies.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The main goal of crypto is decentralization. We all want it, yet when we take profit we take it from centralized place. Stablecoins are backed by traditional currencies, which are again centralized.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

It go the point where Nintendo became THE word for a games console for those that had only a passing knowledge of the subject.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fast forward to today and bitcoin is the new Nintendo, it has owned and still owns the lions share of the crypto market. Most people have heard of it and probably think all crypto IS just bitcoin. Now people refer to everything as a &amp;amp;#39;coin&amp;amp;#39; no matter what it actually is.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The next generation are going to be making memes about us here in the present not knowing the difference between a v2000 utility chip and a micro contract smart tokeniser is and instead calling them both, coins while trying to tell them that back in my day we didn&amp;amp;#39;t need any of this new age fancy stuff.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;DCA + smash buying helps soothe emotional volatility.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Have a plan and stick to it. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The mainstream news is always hilariously wrong about bitcoin.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Shitcoins are a high risk / high reward proposition.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;DONT TRADE. But If you are going to trade you need to measure your performance in bitcoin terms. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Mining is a profession, not a hobby. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Frugality is paramount. If people aren’t laughing at your lifestyle, you probably aren’t hodling or stacking hard enough.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Bitcoin maximalist.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Dude lives in 2012 and still believes that all coins that aren’t bitcoin are scams. He can’t see value in any other project outside bitcoin and worship people like Michael Saylor. Brags about understanding Austrian school of economics but never really read Mises. Constantly makes comparisons about energy use of bitcoin vs banks and gold.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The ethereum dude.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He isn’t a maximalist and actually enjoy other projects, but thinks that ethereum is king. Consider the first mover advantage eth has over smart contracts too much to be overcome by other coins. Keep his coins at the exchange for obvious reasons.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The Cardano geek.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Usually they follow Charles Hoskinson like a cult. Live in a completely isolated world where all that exists is Cardano. They read through each whitepaper but never read about other projects outside of Cardano. They constantly brag about how Cardano is safe due to Haskell and how fast it can become with Hydra. Don’t really do anything with his Cardano, since there’s nothing to do.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The solana cheated wife.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He knows the network is centralized. He knows it keeps getting offline. He knows how bad the initial token distribution was. But since he gained some money in Solana, he is always looking for explanations about Solana problems and bragging about a zillion tps.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The obsessed trader.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He can’t hold one coin for over one month. He’s always checking his charts and always getting hyped about new coins. He says he’s into crypto for the long term but his average holding period is one week. Usually loses money.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The CRO boomer.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Uses the debit card and stake. Believes that CRO will be huge. Don’t understand much about crypto in general, but usually has lots of money and stake all his CRO to get shiny metal cards.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The moonshooter.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He’s always looking for the “next big thing” and very susceptible to YouTubers and influencers. Constantly shill his shitcoins at Reddit and social media. Usually loses money&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The FUDster.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The crash is always incoming and he’s always afraid of losing all his money. Deep down he believes that crypto is a Ponzi scheme. Usually he’s at mid-age and hide his crypto investments from his wife. Every 10% dip he thinks the world is gonna end. Constantly talks about Tether.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Buy high and sell low.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He knows the theory but can’t help to the opposite. He always FOMO at ATH and paperhand sell at lows. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The hodler.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He doesn’t really know much about tech details about the projects he invest in. He doesn’t take profits nor take losses. He doesn’t try to time the market. He just hodl. But that doesn’t stop him from getting hyped up when he has unrealized gains and extremely worried when he has unrealized losses.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Do you know anyone that are in these stereotypes ?
Do you identify in one of them ?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;*sorry for any potential grammar mistakes. I’m from Brazil and English is my second language.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I just don&amp;amp;#39;t know what all it gets used for. Also the job in tech is internal tools dev at a medium sized game publisher. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yep. I think about this constantly, I understand the use case for something like Bitcoin. Transfer money with no middle men. I get that. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What the hell are these other chains supposed to be doing? Half my damn portfolio is Ethereum and I genuinely can&amp;amp;#39;t tell you what your supposed to do with it. Why would you develop an app on a Blockchain? Let alone how. Is there some inherent benefit here? God I have no clue. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For the longest time I just thought it was like providing a decentralized version of something like AWS or Azure, like a grass roots server host. Holy shit I was wrong. There&amp;amp;#39;s all sorts of shit you can make apparently. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But yeah idk. Feels good to come clean. I got into it cause it seemed like a smart investment and so far so good. But I&amp;amp;#39;m amazed I&amp;amp;#39;ve not come across any real application of it in my day to day life so far that I&amp;amp;#39;m aware of at least. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I cannot be alone here right? Please. It&amp;amp;#39;s wild to me that I understand more about the idea behind what an NFT is (supposed to be) used for than any application of any other blockchains. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Idk if anyone else is in this camp and feels dumb you&amp;amp;#39;re not alone. I feel ya.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So these scams go something like this:-
It&amp;amp;#39;s usually a youtube live video of a conference where Elon Musk, Jack Dorsey or Vitalik Buterin with 12k to 20k live viewers which are bots. These conferences are so old that a simple Google image search if these conference would be enough to know for a fact that it is a scam. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Is it just that people are too greedy? I am only 16 and sometimes wonder that if adults are just money hungry dumb dumbs. Please people do not disappoint me.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyone who sells their Bitcoin is still in the fiat mindset, trapped by it, unable to think outside themselves, ignorant to what sound money is and could be.     &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I eventually got into a good DCA schedule but that’s when the May crash happened and I ended up down a lot. I kept buying but I definitely felt sad, defeated, like I might not see my money again for 3-4 years. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This used to emotionally affect me a lot. I’d stare at charts all day, wake up at 3am and panic sell, or panic buy. Looking back those short term price swings didn’t matter. All those trades did was made my taxes super complicated to calculate. No matter how many posts I read saying this, the experience of going through it yourself is where you learn the most. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now I’ve finally reached the point where I am not emotionally affected at all, and it feels amazing. If the price goes up? I have enough invested that I’d be happy with the profits. If the price goes down? I have another potentially life changing opportunity to load up on more crypto. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TLDR: Good opportunities are ahead, whether the price goes up or down in the short term&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Like many of you, I bought this delicious dip. I&amp;amp;#39;m out of money now, but I have an average ETH buy price of $2984...which I think is pretty good. I&amp;amp;#39;m hodling this for the intermediate term because I expect the price of ETH to rise as the date for ETH 2.0 (a.k.a. The Merge) draws nearer. Any ETH traders that are shorting right now should definitely make sure you close out before the date is confirmed because the hype will come on fast and you&amp;amp;#39;ll get rekt. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Naturally, there could be another delay in the launch which, to be fair, would not be great. But if you check out the number of commits on github for ETH 2 clients, many reference improvements to clients for the merge which tells me the devs are working hard at it. I like it!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Strap in, its going to be a bumpy but very fun year.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The signs were there that the project was dead. But I was fooled by getting an entry 50% below ATH, and seeing a quick 50% gain followed by a slow rug. So I held way past  being reasonably certain it was dead. Plus it was shilled by a crypto guy who led me to other actual gems, but I guess it&amp;amp;#39;s true that everyone is a genius in a bull run.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Honorable mention to my friend who fomod into eth in May at 4400, sold for a loss then bought around 4k more recently and sold for a loss again. RIP.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hope this helps everyone feel a little better for the state of affairs we&amp;amp;#39;re all in. What&amp;amp;#39;s your worst crypto story?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: I hope we can all take solace and find solidarity in the fact that most of us have made mistakes and poor choices. And maybe even reflect on what led us to those choices. This game rewards risk takers, and we&amp;amp;#39;re all just one yolo away from a lambo, I think. Not car advice.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thanks for sharing everyone.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit 2: besides obvious (in hindsight) rugs and shitcoins, the most common worst choices are VET, fomoing doge and shib, fomoing CRO (also guilty of this) and buying ADA at peak. And ICP. We&amp;amp;#39;ll do better next time homies.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I bought my coins in the hype of 2017, and watched my portfolio decline in early 2018. A 80% decline.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fast-forward now, 4 years later, I have no stress at all and my portfolio is still greener than green.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In short, my advice would be:
- enjoy life
- ignore your portfolio for the coming years 
- and I&amp;amp;#39;ll see a happy you in 2025 ;)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Peace out&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Bear markets are the rare opportunity for wealth transfers, and are where crypto millionares are made. If you loaded up on $90 ETH and $4K BTC during the March 2020 dip, or either coin from 2019 til then, you&amp;amp;#39;d still be up a TON. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Buying $40K BTC to sell at $60K during a bull market really isn&amp;amp;#39;t going to change your life. Buying during the fear, panic and capitulation is. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I know its hard, but I&amp;amp;#39;d urge you to be calm and excited for a bear market. I doubt we will see an 80-90% dip off ATH, but I HOPE we do. I want to dispose of USD shitcoin and load up on limited supply, lower inflation coins like BTC/ETH, and I have been during this year. But sales and discounts allow you to 10x instead of 2x. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The only reason you should have fear, is if you need this money to pay bills in the next few months. But if you hodl for the long term, you should be very happy that we may have another wealth transfer market on the horizon; transferring wealth from those who can&amp;amp;#39;t afford to wait to those who can. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Good luck.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: Yo guys! Thanks for the responses, no matter showing criticism or support. I don&amp;amp;#39;t really know why people are comparing this situation to being in a toxic relationship, so I will provide another analogy for the quotes: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You have a partner who you have been together for years. Although financially, he/she might not be doing very good, but you know that he/she is TRYING! That&amp;amp;#39;s the main point, there&amp;amp;#39;ll be a great future if u guys stay together. Leaving your partner who is struggling and when they are down is bad...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So one more here, you&amp;amp;#39;re supporting a football club and you know, they can&amp;amp;#39;t win all the games. If you leave your club and go on supporting other clubs when your old club is in a bad form, then don&amp;amp;#39;t come back when they start winning because you simply don&amp;amp;#39;t like the club true heartedly.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I admit it doesn&amp;amp;#39;t feel good when bitcoin dips, but if u paper-handed, then u wont even have the chance to celebrate the highs. So why not have some hopium!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Edit2: many of you still don&amp;amp;#39;t understand what I&amp;amp;#39;m doing here, I&amp;amp;#39;ll try again: when I wrote the post, BTC was lower than a year before that, on January 10th, 2021. Yes, for example on July 21st, 2021 BTC went below 30k and was lower than now - but even at that point BTC was much higher than on July 21st, 2020 (a year earlier), when it was at 9k&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I got into crypto in late 2020. During that whole time, whether BTC was up or down in the past days or weeks, you could always &amp;amp;quot;zoom out&amp;amp;quot;, look at the prices a year ago and see that it was still up a ton compared to then.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For the first time since I got into crypto, this is not the case anymore. At the time I write this, BTC is down 1.5% compared to a year ago, compared to Coingecko. So I got curious: when was the last time BTC was down from a year earlier? So I got the data and looked into how BTC opening prices changed to a year earlier every day since 2013.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To answer the question: &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;September 14th, 2020,&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; when it was very closely below where it was a year earlier. The last time it was lower than a year earlier for more than a few scattered days was June to July 2020, the last time it was consistently down a lot compared to a year earlier for a long time was in early 2019. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/a/BfBfXWu&quot;&amp;gt;Here is the data for the past 3 years in an ugly graph&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, you can see it was up for the vast majority of the time and was more than 1,000% up in March 2021 compared to March 2020.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Widening the time frame, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/a/9BxCR52&quot;&amp;gt;here you can see the whole time frame I analyzed&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, and, not very surprisingly, BTC has also been up compared to a year earlier for the vast majority of the time as well.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some more fun facts:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;BTC was up 8,671% from a year earlier on November 30th, 2013&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;BTC was down 90% from a year earlier on January 16th, 2019&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;during the whole time frame, BTC was up compared to a year earlier for 2634 days and down for 627 days&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;the longest timeframe BTC was continuously up compared to a year earlier was from December 6th, 2015 to October 31st, 2018 (1,060 days)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;the longest timeframe BTC was continuously down compared to a year earlier was from November 16th, 2014 to November 2nd, 2015 (351 days)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sometimes individuals remind us that the whole purpose of cryptocurrencies is that a decentralized financial system allows us freedom and independence from a third party as we conduct our transactions.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But still crypto will never replace fiat fully.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto and Fiat will coexist.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fiat money has been used for longer and is accepted more globally then crypto, but crypto offers many advantages that fiat currencies do not have, especially when we talk about inflation and creating a fair financial system.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Unlike gold that has gold in it and silver that has silver in it ,fiat as paper has worthless paper in it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But the central government gives value to this paper and it exists only because the central government says that it has purchasing power.  Also, with the help of the central power, states preserve power, and thus peace with all manipulation that comes with it.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is precisely those states that will simply never hand over that power, but will jealously guard it, and whatever crypto does, fiat will historically still be there.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto will not replace Fiat, but with cryptocurrencies we get one strong alternative that we can use whenever we want, and banks will therefore have to change their business.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
