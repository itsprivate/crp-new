&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I say this from the perspective of the average user.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How to explain to a newcomer who wants to buy, say, an ERC-20 token that he has to pay hundreds of dollars to perform ordinary transactions. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And then the newcomer needs to be explained that a fee that can cost him hundreds of dollars can be lost forever if the transaction fails. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cryptocurrencies should make our finances easier, not harder. And I&amp;amp;#39;m sorry to say this, but I think that with ETH 2.0, the fees will also be incredibly expensive. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the real world, people aren’t used to paying that much for everyday transactions. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How do you even start researching and trading ETH if you are from some country where salary is less than the fee that we need to pay?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The vision of the crypto future should be cheap, nobody wants to pay a few hundred to enjoy that freedom.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you&amp;amp;#39;re not familiar with earning a yield on your coins, I&amp;amp;#39;m about to turn your world upside down! If you didn&amp;amp;#39;t already know, there are a number of companies out there who will pay in-kind interest on your coins for doing nothing other than holding them on their platform. In-kind interest is one of the easiest ways to compound your investment and see exponential returns! So not only will you be earning interest on your coins while you wait for the price to moon, the interest you earn along the way will moon right along with it!!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Don&amp;amp;#39;t take my word for it. Give it a go. Lower you average purchase price. Fatten your bags while you sleep. Stack your coins regardless of bear or bull or crab or shark or tadpole or beaver or flightless bird cycle. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyway, here is my &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vpBQI2DFUk7zXS4TCs9ZOnatvWHiYf5jHjKgKpfJG5Y/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&amp;gt;Interest Rates Comparison Tool&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; for you to use, free of charge. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you have any questions about earning interest on your coins, questions about any of the platforms featured in this tool, questions about this tool, or really just crypto questions in general, I&amp;amp;#39;m more than happy to talk through them with you! I&amp;amp;#39;m happy to continue this thread or communicate via dm, whichever you&amp;amp;#39;re more comfortable with.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

People that panic not only leave the market with  losses, they kill off future potential gains too.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Meanwhile, people that accumulate during dips are usually the ones to reap the maximum benefits when the market eventually recovers. I&amp;amp;#39;ve seen this first hand after the May crash. Most people lost faith and left the market in a loss thinking this was the end of the cycle, while those who accumulated reaped all the benefits after the market pumped late July.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you area newbie  investing into Crypto, never give up. The market will never go up in a straight like and there will always be significant dips along the way. The best thing to do in a bearish market right now is to accumulate for the next pump, because when it does, people like you who stuck around during the bad times will be the ones with the most gains.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And in case you didn&amp;amp;#39;t notice:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&quot;md-spoiler-text&quot;&amp;gt;It is 2022.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&quot;md-spoiler-text&quot;&amp;gt;Bitcoin did in fact NOT hit even close to $100k.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That doesn&amp;amp;#39;t mean that the market won&amp;amp;#39;t go down of course, it very likely could go down further. It also could start pumping and if you don&amp;amp;#39;t continue to DCA you&amp;amp;#39;ll miss the chance to average down those ATH buy in prices you probably entered the market with. The market is already almost 50% down, even if it dips further this is still a great price point to be buying in on almost all coins in terms of risk / reward.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The point is that take two massive piles of table salt whenever anyone tries to tell you they are anything other than &amp;amp;#39;guessing&amp;amp;#39; what the market is going to do. Ignore all the &amp;amp;#39;TA&amp;amp;#39; and the graphs and the political rumours and hearsay and don&amp;amp;#39;t worry about the stock markets. They have been telling me that the stock markets are about to crash any day now for over a year and the FTSE just keeps on reaching new post-COVID highs.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So invest wisely and DO research and make informed opinions but also filter out the doomsayers and the market crash predicters.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here is the real bear though. When you sit here and import everything into your coin tracker of choice (Koinly here), everything may not be there. I spent the last two days trying different platforms and importing API’s. Nothing seemed to work. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Does anyone else relate? I got back into this ages ago, and I&amp;amp;#39;ve gotten so used to the market, I don&amp;amp;#39;t even care when I see my money fluctuate that much. I&amp;amp;#39;m just like, oh, cool, another day. I made 10k or lost 10k over night on a trade, who cares.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s amazing that it can be like that, I never thought I would see my income streams be that worthless but exciting at the same time. It&amp;amp;#39;s truly exciting but at the same time as of late I&amp;amp;#39;ve learned to check out since we&amp;amp;#39;ve been on a downtrend. My main holdings are in alts so I&amp;amp;#39;m seeing more volatile movement, I&amp;amp;#39;m really big on LUNA and AVAX- I think they are extremely promising projects, I also love Ethereum for obvious reasons like Smart Contracts.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I can&amp;amp;#39;t even imagine people who wake up each day and lose or gain 1 mil, 5 mil... and to think it&amp;amp;#39;s just perspective.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As we know the Crypto markets and BTC/USDT have been in a clear downtrend for the past few weeks, 10 weeks to be precise. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/ee3rw5rjhac81.png?width=871&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=4624d564ca358a1b8591917d4aa9070eb064c0c9&quot;&amp;gt;BTC/USDT | Binance | Heikin Ashi Candles&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In this chart we can clearly see the downward trending regression, with a Pearson&amp;amp;#39;s R of over 90%, meaning that the regression is a fairly accurate measure in this context. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the past when Bitcoin went below the Bull Market Support Band (&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tradingview.com/script/uSBR7cFa-Bull-Market-Support-Band-20w-SMA-21w-EMA/&quot;&amp;gt;info&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;), we saw a 12 week downwards/sideways movement from May to July-21. As of right now, BTC 21w EMA sits at $48k, and the current price is $42k. This points to a scenario where I think, we are about to see bearish (or sideways at best) price movements for the next 1-2 months. The recent update in human malware might also contribute to this trend. But do I think $69k was the top of this cycle? &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;NO&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. Reason being:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;If the theory of the lengthening cycle is to be believed, we still can be bullish for long, and the BTC can go much higher than $69,000.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The charts indicate that this wasn&amp;amp;#39;t a double top, as the recent local top($69,000) is a bit higher than the last one ($64,000).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All in all, I think this is merely a short term (3-4 months) downward volatility period, and it&amp;amp;#39;s a nice time to DCA down your average prices. But I would like to emphasize the fact that crypto investments are not for everyone. As seen in many of the recent posts and FUD, it&amp;amp;#39;s clear that  some people can&amp;amp;#39;t handle bearish price movements.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;If you’re gonna do dumb things because your stock goes down, you shouldn’t own a stock at all.

~ Warren Buffett
&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Similarly, if you&amp;amp;#39;re gonna sell your coins every time it goes down, you probably shouldn&amp;amp;#39;t invest in crypto at all.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While Mr Buffett might not be the most pro-crypto person, we can all agree that his views on price movements are on-point and effective. That&amp;amp;#39;s because, price movements and patterns in crypto are very similar to that in traditional stock markets, except with much higher volatility.   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In conclusion, I would say that we need to have a fair bit of persistence and faith to make it out of this tunnel. I certainly think that $69k was not the top, and we can go much higher in this cycle. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cheers!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

About 12 hours ago, they tweeted that a &amp;amp;quot;small number of users&amp;amp;quot; reported suspicious activity on their accounts and that they would disable withdrawals for a bit, just to be safe. Just ten minutes ago, they tweeted &amp;amp;quot;Update: Withdrawal services have been restored. All funds are safe.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I personally have never used crypto.com specifically and therefore have no money on there. But honestly, if this had happened to one of the exchanges I use (I won&amp;amp;#39;t say which because it&amp;amp;#39;s not about that, but I use two of the big ones and have a relevant amount of money for me on each of them) I wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t have been worried at all. Big exchanges have insurance, have most of their funds in cold wallets, and especially a very public exchange like crypto.com couldn&amp;amp;#39;t afford the PR disaster of not refunding their customers if it was even remotely their own fault.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;ve seen a few posts and many comments saying that this proves you should never trust an exchange with cour crypto. But looking at how they reacted - immediately disabling withdrawals, communicating openly etc. - and considering they &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;have&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; to react this way to avoid a PR disaster - I think if this shows anything, it&amp;amp;#39;s rather the opposite: if you have a good password and 2FA, most likely it&amp;amp;#39;s totally fine to leave your coins and tokens on one of the big, trustworthy exchanges.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m not saying you should not use your own wallet, for many people that&amp;amp;#39;s the better solution. But especially if you&amp;amp;#39;re new, you&amp;amp;#39;re much more likely to send your coins to nirvana or to lose your private keys than you are to lose your funds if you leave them on the exchange.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m pretty sure y&amp;amp;#39;all will hate this opinion, but I wanted to get it off my chest. Let the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;NOT YOUR KEYS NOT YOUR CRYPTO!!1!&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; come!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Also have an Icy White and a LOT of crypto staked on The Exchange, in Crypto.com Earn and (due to my CRO entry price being well under $0.10) a six-figure sum of CRO staked for the CDC Icy.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To wake up today and see Reddit plastered with info about the ‘Hack’ was concerning, but not as concerning as what might happen to the price of CRO. Then I remembered several important factors:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Security&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;100% of user cryptocurrencies are held offline in cold storage.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;‘Crypto.com has a strategic partnership with Ledger, integrating its institutional-grade custody solution, Ledger Vault. We also leverage hardware security modules (HSM) and multi-signature technologies. Crypto.com has secured a total of USD 750M in cold storage insurance against physical damage or destruction, and third-party theft.’&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Users’ fiat currencies are held in regulated custodian bank accounts.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you are a U.S. resident, your USD balances are held at Metropolitan Commercial Bank, an FDIC member and insured depository institution. Your USD balances held at Metropolitan Commercial Bank are insured up to USD $250,000. You retain ownership of those funds in Metropolitan Commercial Bank accounts, meaning your fiat funds cannot be claimed by Crypto.com or its creditors.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Crypto.com Becomes the First FinTech Company to achieve the coveted Data Protection Trust Mark (DPTM) awarded by Singapore’s Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.crypto.com/crypto-com-first-fintech-company-to-achieve-singapores-data-protection-trust-mark-dptm/&quot;&amp;gt;https://blog.crypto.com/crypto-com-first-fintech-company-to-achieve-singapores-data-protection-trust-mark-dptm/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Communication&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As soon as the hack had been confirmed, CDC did what they have always done best: swiftly recognised that there was an ongoing issue and communicated not only what had happened (2FA compromised on user accounts), but also reassured users that all withdrawals would be suspended until they rolled out an app update which would enable 2FA to be re-enabled and accounts once again secured:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;CDC Customer Support on Reddit:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://np.reddit.com/r/Crypto_com/comments/s63105/earlier_today_a_small_number_of_users_experienced/&quot;&amp;gt;https://np.reddit.com/r/Crypto_com/comments/s63105/earlier_today_a_small_number_of_users_experienced/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;CRO and Staking&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One main reason that a lot of people prefer CDC is the high rates paid on Earn when you stake your coins for a fixed period. Staking is also available on the CDC Exchange and on the CDC DeFi Wallet. That seems to have been a HUGE positive as neither The Exchange nor the DeFi Wallet were affected and remained fully functional while the app was locked for an enforced 2FA reset for all users.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Moreover, as a large percentage of the supply of CRO is staked, a run on the price of CRO was prevented (at least so far).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The Crypto.com VISA Cards&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Wallet for the CDC VISA card has always remained entirely separate from the Fiat Wallet and the Crypto Wallet. You can only transfer -FROM- the Fiat or Crypto Wallets to your VISA Card to top up the balance. There is no option to transfer FROM your CDC VISA back to the Fiat or Crypto Wallets. I now see that as a huge positive as the CDC VISA cards were completely unaffected during the hack and continued to function as normal.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The significance of this hack to the reputation of CDC&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We’ve been before. Back in 2019 Binance was hacked when 2FA was compromised and some $40 million of crypto was stolen (&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plugandplaytechcenter.com/resources/binance-hack-three-lessons-you-can-learn-it/&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.plugandplaytechcenter.com/resources/binance-hack-three-lessons-you-can-learn-it/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;). Binance were also swift to act, admit what had happened and keep users informed of how they would address the breach – that was why trust with users was retained and Binance is today, three years on, the largest exchange in the world.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At this point, it appears a similar exploit was used by the hackers to gain access to some CDC accounts and some users have reported funds being transferred from their crypto wallets. Given that this has happened less than a month after the renaming of the Staples Center to the Crypto.com Arena – and just a month before the Crypto.com SuperBowl ad is due to air, I’d say the timing of this hack was ideal. Let me explain why …&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Conclusion&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We all know that CDC have spent an absolute fortune on two things: Regulatory Compliance and Advertising/Sponsorships. They also have official partnerships with VISA and LEDGER. Given just how large their budgets clearly are, securing customer accounts and ensuring this NEVER happens again will almost certainly be their top priority at this point.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bad as this is, CDC’s response has so far been textbook and for that they deserve credit. But what will really matter is how they keep us all updated, how they propose to tighten security and -most importantly of all – that CDC fully reimburse any customer who lost funds as a result of this attack.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fortune may Favour the Brave, but we crypto holders are unforgiving. CDC, this is your moment to retain our trust and show the sceptics that hiring Jason Bourne was FAR from your best move yet.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Gamers threatened to cancel their Discord membership, Square Enix got criticized for introducing NFTs in &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Kingdom Hearts&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, Ubisoft got panned for a similar NFT program last month...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At first, I was aghast. Why would gamers reject so violently a new technology? I am not a gamer myself, so it was troubling.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But I read about it, and I came to this conclusion : gamers are not against to NFTs, they are against microtransactions cash-grabs. And to them, non-fungible tokens are nothing more than another way for studios to make more money. But this will change.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;From what I read, the gaming industry has been plagued by microtransactions for quite some time now. You pay $60 for a game, and yet, you need to fork out more money to buy clothes, armor, weapons, etc., for your character. That pisses off players, and rightly so. So when big studios such as Square Enix or Ubisoft announced plans to offer NFTs, those same gamers are pissed off : they only see this technology as another form of microtransactions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;(There are also energy consumption concerns, but as most NFTs are build on Ethereum, those concerns will evaporate in six months when it switch to proof-of-stake.)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;That&amp;amp;#39;s why I think that, in the long-term, NFTs will find a way into the gaming industry.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; When/if big studios find ways to make it enticing for players, the revolution will begin. The tech will mature, the fears will fade away, and our ecosystem will benefit from this.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Imagine risking your 42 ETH for a newly created token that is not even known much. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A guy lost over $135k while trying to purchase a token named &amp;amp;quot;fees.Wtf&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The user accidentally swapped 42ETH for 0.00004 WTF. ,the actual value of the token was just $0.000005 &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This happened due to low liquidity in the trading pool .&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fees.WTF is a tool that allows users to track the fees they spend on ETH.It airdropped it&amp;amp;#39;s WTF tokens on Thursday. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Use cases include staking WTF or it&amp;amp;#39;s liquidity pool tokens with annualized returns of up to 7,000%&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As soon as the token got listed on ETH based exchange Uniswap,speculators hoping that an eventual price rise would net them handsome returns.In this race, the guy lost 42 ETH.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The developers seeded the initial pool on Uniswap with over 2,211 WTF and 0.000001 ETH causing a huge imbalance in the trading pool. This allowed users to sell low amounts of WTF for relatively high amounts of ETH, while buyers of WTF ended up purchasing the tokens at a much higher value&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

We are not that early, and I hate when people are leaving that imperssion on new investors.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We are early from perspective of crypto and blockchain as a technology that can really change some things in nowadays financial world and world as a whole.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However holding coins that are standing strong like BTC and ETH in this highly volatile market is lowering your risk and in some way saving your money because they will stick with us for a long time. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But you are not late. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you invested in any top10 coins in the begining of 2021 you would be in profit in each of it, even BCH.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also if you invested last year in coins like MATIC, FTM, SOL and held it, your profits would go x1000.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You need to be very smart and very lucky to choose a right coin with a good project and after you do that you need to hold it while it goes up and that is a thing of masterpiece. But no, you won&amp;amp;#39;t get rich with $1000 in BTC, we are not that early.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I owned a nice bag of it and sold a few days before it did those nice gains thinking I&amp;amp;#39;d be better off with fiat during the dip.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Usually I buy before crashes, so at least it&amp;amp;#39;s a new type of mistake. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I thought that in 2022 I&amp;amp;#39;d make better choices and decisions with my crypto. Currently just HODLing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;How about you? Which stupid mistakes have you made with your crypto?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

(That they are capable of conning the common investor with their duplicitous analysis.)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Many prominent leaders have commented on this issue- one of them is by former principal deputy associate attorney general Bill Baer, who had to say this about Moody&amp;amp;#39;s:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Moody&amp;amp;#39;s failed to adhere to its own credit rating standards and fell short on its pledge of transparency in the run-up to the Great Recession.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is not just true for Moody&amp;amp;#39;s but every other analysts would have a price attached to their heads. If you have connections and you sit in an influential position, you could pretty much influence the ratings of a bankrupt company. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So a friendly reminder- most of these ratings don&amp;amp;#39;t mean shit.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I am specifically talking about the USA and the taxation system generally. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We must all pay our taxes to keep the world going round. But what really really grinds my gears is the cheek of our governments to impose such a high rate of tax when we have taken the risk of investing in crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;By investing in crypto we take the chance of getting rug pulled, scammed, hacked and having the wool pulled over our eyes. Not to mention the fact crypto is highly volatile and we risk having large chunks of our portfolio wiped on a daily basis. We have little to no legal recourse in the event this happens to us yet we pay such a high rate.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At least if you invest in the stockmarket there are mechanisms to punish companies that engage in insider trading or manipulate the market. The taxation there arguably reflects the lesser risk you take.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The government can&amp;amp;#39;t have it&amp;amp;#39;s cake and eat it too. We should be pushing hard for regulation that gives us protection in this space or at the very least a reform of the tax system that reflects the high level of risk we take investing in crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I opened an account in December and within a week was hacked. The hacker somehow was able to change my phone number for two-factor authentication therefore I am unable to access the account or even freeze or close the account. When calling Coinbase help, I cannot reach a human for help. Numerous emails result in automated responses pointing me to self-help pages and FAQs. This is unacceptable! How can Coinbase be a publicly-traded company?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I simply want to regain access to my account and have no way to do so. Looking over at ethscan, it looks like my account is being used for incoming and outgoing transactions without my consent.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If Coinbase wants to be a leader in Crypto, then it needs to demonstrate solid customer support. Right now there is less than zero support. It’s dangerous and too risky to use.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So first off with simple google search of &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;NFT news&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, you&amp;amp;#39;ll see ridiculous numbers floating around here and there.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Ghozali Everyday: Indonesian man with US$1 million selfies an unlikely NFT star&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Gift to Pope Francis Sold as NFT Raises $80,000 for Afghanistan &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;you know it&amp;amp;#39;s profitabble when the church even dabbles in it&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;‘World of Women’ NFTs Are Cracking Crypto’s Boys-Club Image &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;even feministic articles are in the news now&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The way NFTs are being used right now (images, digital representations), I see that many people still like NFTs, at this point I don&amp;amp;#39;t really care anymore. People are profiting (I hope) from it so it&amp;amp;#39;s no wonder every NFT news blows up. Although, right now all of these are purely out of speculations and NFT owners are basically hoping that the next sucker would want to pay more for their &amp;lt;del&amp;gt;trash&amp;lt;/del&amp;gt; stuff. Not only these NFTs have no current use some NFT projects don&amp;amp;#39;t even have a future that can be look forward to, no promises, no roadmaps, nothing, aside from the hopes that the hype kicks in and it blows up in price. Sounds familiar right? Yeah, just like shitcoins/memecoins.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I may get a lot of flack for comparing NFTs and memecoins, but hear me out. Like I said in my first line, I&amp;amp;#39;m not referring to the NFT tech as the same as memecoins, but the sense of it being a gambling space. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With all the news focusing on the gains on NFTs and ridiculous prices it sells for and the risk being completely written off, no wonder more people are gambling in this space, but let&amp;amp;#39;s not forget how majority of people would end up as bag holders. Just be careful if you plan to dabble on these NFT collections/projects. I really would just rather gamble on pokemon cards, honestly.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These NFTs are worse than shitcoins/memecoins gambling. Big name celebrities are in it for the fun &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;or money laundering for fun like some people say&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;, but as retailers this is really a risky &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;investment&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; if you can&amp;amp;#39;t get out on time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also, unlike shitcoins/memecoins, NFT news are literally everywhere they even get mentioned in reputable news website. The exposure to the public mass and non-crypto people is ridiculously high. So more suckers would get sucked in in this blackhole.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I have been in 2 crashes and been DCAing in the dips and thus I am still sitting in gains territory. But most people will sell especially new retail investors. I have heard people saying that they will HODL and just wait. While some optimist believe they can time the market. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I will just continue with my DCAs, staking and HODL. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And whenever we see some nice green gains I might take out my initially investments. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I see these people all the time, and I’m sure you do as well. People who think that once they’ve moved on to using BTC, they’re forever freed of taxes, institutions, the government, and ‘big brother’. Well it doesn’t work that way, and those a little more experienced in crypto will tend to agree.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitcoin was an experiment, it went well but it still has a long way to go. Bitcoin isn’t anonymous, it’s pseudonymous, anyone who can find one address of yours, can track your entire search history. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Something else Bitcoin has to work on, is the largeholder control. A few whales control the majority of the market. Decentralized organizations have already solved this using DAOs. You see when you use a DAO, take BitDAO for example, you don’t have to put your trust in the hands of a few sketchy men. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Instead, you are given the choice of handing your confidence to the entirety of the public. No honest man is in power, and no power is given to an honest man. You can’t trust humans to control your fortunes. You too, should handle a share of the responsibility of the fortunes of yours as well as others, and that’s how DAOs work. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you only trust politicians to rule and soldiers to fight, then don’t be surprised when war is fought by fools and governments are ruled by cowards.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

And right now the numbers aren’t on the side of DOGE.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;DOGE is sitting at a whopping $22 billion market cap meaning that any chance at a pump is very thin and other coins like ELON with a much small market cap of $700 million will most probably have a much higher chance at multiple pumps.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you’re gonna invest in memecoins then I’m not one to judge but investing in DOGE right now would honestly be a bad move in my personal opinion.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The market cap to TVL ratio is still high at 4.5 so I don&amp;amp;#39;t see this downtrend ending anytime soon without any new catalysts. If you compare this to another hyped coin like CRO, which saw a meteoretic rise and who&amp;amp;#39;s price has stabilized since then (especially if you look at the CRO/BTC pair), you can see that LRC is nowhere near a bottom. I could easily see Loopring dropping below $1 again, assuming no significant BTC movements happen.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And yet, all I see on this sub is more threads shilling the coin and doses of hopium about the long term potential? Nobody is seriously discussing price action over the last two months which is a huge concern to me. I&amp;amp;#39;m not arguing that Loopring is a dead project, far from it, but the short term price prospects are very meagre. Everyone should decide what to do for themselves i.e. risk management, but I don&amp;amp;#39;t see any value in bagholding it when there&amp;amp;#39;s no end in sight for the downwards trend.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Don&amp;amp;#39;t get me wrong, I see huge potential in ZK roll ups and in particular LRC for the next five years eventhough I don&amp;amp;#39;t own it myself. In fact, I&amp;amp;#39;m looking for this downtrend to end so I can buy it when it eventually consolidates. Since Loopring is by far the most shilled coin on this sub , I feel bad for the ones that FOMO&amp;amp;#39;d in after the price rise in early November. These people are seeing their gains evaporate like snow in the sun or are suffering big losses. Maybe an announcement by Gamestop at the end of this month or during the next earnings call will stop this downtrend, but I don&amp;amp;#39;t see it stopping anytime soon before that.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;EDIT: To anyone commenting that price doesn&amp;amp;#39;t matter, well it does. Let me put it this way, if LRC is $1.35 and you feel like it will move below $1 in the short term: you should absolutely sell because you can increase your holdings for the long term with 35%&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;EDIT 2: Obviously DCA&amp;amp;#39;ing is also an option when the price drops, I would wait until the price stabilizes though&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;EDIT 3: Since I received the suicide care message from Reddit and multiple threats in my inbox, I will no longer interact with this thread. What a shame that people can&amp;amp;#39;t behave.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Block size increase&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The  bigger the block, the more transactions it can carry. Block size was  recently increased by 8KB to 72KB (a 12.5% increase); further increases  will be applied over time based on ongoing system monitoring and overall  network health.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Pipelining&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Improves block  propagation times by coalescing validation and propagation. The goal is  for blocks to be propagated to at least 95% of peers within five seconds  by reducing the ‘dead time’ between blocks (the block propagation  overhead). This provides the headroom to make more aggressive scaling  changes, such as increasing block size/increasing Plutus parameter limits.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Input Endorsers&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Input endorsers  improve block propagation times and throughput by allowing transactions  to be separated into pre-constructed blocks. This improves the  consistency of block propagation times and allows higher transaction  rates.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Memory /CPU parameters for Plutus&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Memory  usage is more efficient across the chain. Specifically, there are  memory improvements in Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) handling, stake  distribution, live stake distribution and pools, and hash  representation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Plutus script enhancements&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Even more effective usage of the powerful EUTXO model through smart contract optimization, including: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Reference  inputs (CIP-0031)  – Plutus scripts can inspect transaction inputs  without needing to spend them. This means that it is not necessary to  create UTXOs simply to inspect the information held by an input.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Plutus  Datums (CIP-0032) – Datums can be attached directly to outputs instead  of datum hashes. This simplifies how datums are used, as a user can see  the actual datum rather than having to supply the datum that matches the  given hash.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Script sharing (CIP-0033) – Plutus script  references can be associated with transaction outputs, meaning that they  can be recorded on-chain for subsequent reuse. It will not be necessary  to supply a copy of the script with each transaction, hugely reducing  friction for developers. Reusing scripts in multiple transactions  significantly reduces transaction sizes, improving throughput and  reducing script execution costs.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Node enhancements&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Improvements  will help even distribution of stake and reward computations across the  epochs, thus providing greater headroom for block size increases. Also,  memory usage is now more efficient. Memory compaction reduces RSS  footprint, and memory sharing means we need less data instantiated. Node  version 1.3.3, from January 2022, reduces peak load at critical points,  including the epoch boundary.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;On-disk storage&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;By  storing portions of the protocol state on disk, nodes will need to hold  less in memory, meaning that RAM-constrained systems will be able to  run nodes provided they have sufficient storage, and memory will no  longer be a bottleneck on scalability. This will enable significant  growth in the blockchain state.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Off-chain solutions&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Sidechains&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A sidechain is a separate blockchain connected to a main blockchain (the  &amp;amp;#39;main&amp;amp;#39; chain, also known as parent chain), through a two-way mechanism  (the &amp;amp;#39;bridge&amp;amp;#39;) that enables tokens and other digital assets from one  chain to be used in another and results returned to the original chain.  Assets can be moved between chains as needed. One single parent chain  can have multiple interoperable sidechains connected to it, which may  operate in completely different ways. EVM sidechains coming to Cardano  include dcSpark’s Milkomeda and IOG’s Mamba. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Hydra&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Introduces  isomorphic state channels to maximize throughput, minimize latency,  incur low to no costs, and greatly reduce storage requirements. Hydra  provides a more efficient means to process transactions off-chain while  using the main-chain ledger as the secure settlement layer.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Off-chain computing&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Offloading  some of the computation, for example with Asynchronous Contract  Execution (ACE)  can drive greater core network efficiency. Transactions  occur outside of the blockchain itself, yet can offer fast, cheap  transactions via a trust model.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Mithril&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To  achieve greater scalability, you need to address the complexity of  critical operations that depend logarithmically on the number of  participants. Mithril will improve chain synchronization while  maintaining trust. The result? Multi-signature aggregation that is fast  and efficient without compromising security features.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TL;DR: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/ff38dd08-5947-4c52-af32-15c59cdcdcf8/-/format/webp/-/quality/best/-/progressive/yes/&quot;&amp;gt;All this summarized in one pic&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bonus:  Plutus is basically Haskell which is native smart contract language for the Cardano blockchain. Plutus contracts consist of parts that run on the blockchain  (on-chain code) and parts that run on a user’s machine (off-chain or  client code). Both the on-chain and off-chain code are written in Haskell, and Plutus smart contracts are effectively Haskell programs.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
