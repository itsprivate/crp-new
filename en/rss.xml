&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When put to scientific tests it doesn&amp;amp;#39;t hold up against empirical evidence. Analysts consistently looking at different indicators and hedge their analysis. Often going BACK to data and drawing lines saying LOOK LOOK it broke the barrier line trend hill thing! SEE!           &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Listen - if this stuff actually worked - we would have giant AI computers dedicated to learning how to do it - oh that&amp;amp;#39;s right we do - and you know what happens when we plug them in to the system? The system figures it out and reacts differently. The global mood changes on a dime and all TA goes out the door with it.         &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;tldr; IT IS NOT OBJECTIVE.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;         &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Let me be clear, there ARE definite patterns within the stock market, and if they are recognized they can be successfully traded upon, but analyst cannot separate themselves from their beliefs and pre-dispositions, they selectively, and possibly sub-consciously, choose charts and TA indicators that confirm what they have already concluded.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Posts about crypto usually get bombed with the most classic argument after its all a scam: &amp;amp;quot;crypto is killing the environment due to mining&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I mean it&amp;amp;#39;s right to some extent that crypto is using electricity that is unsustainable for mining. With that dancing the environment. But those people are onto some other stuff. Many thinking that all 5k cryptos use mining that is 100% unsustainable.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So let&amp;amp;#39;s be clear very few cryptos nowadays use pow and even then the energy for mining is getting more and more sustainable. At least already more than their beloved banks.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Seeing so many people uneducated about crypto but spreading hate shows how much growing room we still have left.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Did you take the price chart and take it to art class?

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Posting this for several years!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Around the same amount that last week. We are looking for around 110 BTC monthly. Way lower that years ago.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Reason? New exchanges, where Binance is king, &amp;amp;quot;the&amp;amp;quot; P2P (with all the risk involved) option to go, not only BTC but other crypto and stablecoins. Easiest way of purchase BTC with devaluated Bolivares (Bs.)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sadly, Binance doesn&amp;amp;#39;t offer the stats of the amound traded. But it is safe to assume Binance (And other exchanges like Reserve and AirTM) has absorbed all the amount that LocalBitcoin used to trade.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Monthly minimum wage is 2 USD that is for public workers and they receive some kind of incentives (a monthly box of food that is around 20 USD), you cannot live with that.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;If that is you only income, you died years ago starving or your family is helping inside Venezuela or from abroad or you have another job or you left the country (even walking).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Average monthly wage is around 90 USD (Monthly). A Manager is around 210 USD (monthly). &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://talcualdigital-com.translate.goog/ovf-salario-promedio-del-sector-comercio-subio-un-71-a-892-durante-2021/?_x_tr_sl=es&amp;amp;amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;amp;amp;_x_tr_hl=en-US&amp;amp;amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp&quot;&amp;gt;https://talcualdigital-com.translate.goog/ovf-salario-promedio-del-sector-comercio-subio-un-71-a-892-durante-2021/?_x_tr_sl=es&amp;amp;amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;amp;amp;_x_tr_hl=en-US&amp;amp;amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Some NGO say around 500 USD monthly are needed for a 5 members family to &amp;amp;quot;live&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;There are in fact so many places (department stores, big ones like Traki, Biomercados) where you can pay directly with crypto. People always use stablecoins like &amp;amp;quot;USDT&amp;amp;quot; (what a fear), USDC, BUSD, AirUSD and so on.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;2021 inflation was around 700%.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We invest in crypto, keyword : &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Invest&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Obviously, this is a clear example why you should avoid VC funded decentralized projects with CEO, CFOs. All those schemes are vulnerable to regulatory annihilation or chief executive rug pull.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
This is why El Salvador is bitcoin only!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

It is an investment arm of Coinbase to invest in early-stage cryptocurrency and blockchain startups. You can check the portfolio at Messari website.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Their portfolio contains 18 coins as of  now:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Larger market cap ($5B plus): LUNA, MATIC, NEAR, UNI&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Average market cap ($1B plus): GRT, FLOW, AR, CELO&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Small market cap (less than $1B): AUDIO, RLY, UMA, KEEP, RSR, DODO, RARI&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Okay, enough introduction. Let&amp;amp;#39;s see how these coins perform in the last 1 year, from Jan 2021 to date.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;1. Overall performance - ROI 1168%; 15/18 up; 3/18 down&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/axvjaey6c4g81.png?width=925&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=6508771f2076b077e3585e1bbb7ee17cec4cddc5&quot;&amp;gt;Coinbase Venture&amp;amp;#39; portfolio&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Even when the market is still down right now, the return is 1,168%. This is a great return compared to various asset classes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/ujjxpreqc4g81.png?width=463&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=48e6e9b5fb65cd81cdd5efe5c04db7c1b7abe52a&quot;&amp;gt;Comparison to other asset classes&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Except oil, which has a relatively fine return of 93%, the rest isn&amp;amp;#39;t that impressive. And Mr Pete, I&amp;amp;#39;m looking at you. Gold price actually decreased by 7% in the last year.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;2. The top gainers and which are the threes that make losses?&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The top 5 gainers in this portfolio is MATIC, LUNA, AR, NEAR and AUDIO. The most impressive ones are MATIC and LUNA which had returned over 8000%.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/brsh46l4d4g81.png?width=447&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=7e28276133d7844c27b79c70affee776b0088009&quot;&amp;gt;Top gainers and 3 losers&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The losses are actually not that huge, however. It&amp;amp;#39;s quite normal for small cap coins to lose over 90% value in a market downturn. I&amp;amp;#39;d say COMP will go back up pretty quickly once the market improves.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;3. Show me the sectors - which market niches do CV invested in and how do they perform&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now I sort the portfolio based on the sector. You could see BTC stands as a category, even though it&amp;amp;#39;s labelled as &amp;amp;quot;Currencies&amp;amp;quot; as it is the OG cryptocurrency, but nowadays it&amp;amp;#39;s more like a store value of money. BTC is also the staple in the many institutional investor&amp;amp;#39;s holdings.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/0foje1azd4g81.png?width=825&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=84ecbae33684c4167b940c6ff5cb13786ebe4f99&quot;&amp;gt;By sector&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;CV invested quite heavily in smart contract platforms, which features ETH, LUNA, NEAR, FLOW and CELO. I&amp;amp;#39;d also argue that MATIC is closely related, though it&amp;amp;#39;s not a L1, but with the high gas fees of Ethereum, MATIC as the front runner of scalability will be needed for a foreseeable future. All of this category did well, most notably LUNA and MATIC. NEAR also has a good run lately, though it&amp;amp;#39;s not often mentioned in this sub.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m quite surprised that CV didn&amp;amp;#39;t invest in ATOM and DOT, the two front runners of interoperability. However, they did invest in a small cap on this, which is KEEP Network. So far it has doubled in value but probably needs more time to prove its worth.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;DeFi is a little disappointed at the moment, but many has predicted DeFi will see its rise in 2022. CV invested in only 1 lending defi which is COMP.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Other niche markets had been seeing mix results:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Asset management (RSR): down at the moment, but this is also quite new.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Content distribution: AUDIO - which has returns quite nicely as it&amp;amp;#39;s the front runner in music streaming.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Data management (The Graph): doing ok at the moment. It might have the time with Web3.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Exchanges (UNI and DODO): UNI has its time in 2021 like most others, DODO has been in trouble with the hack last year.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;File storage (AR): recently has partnered with Solana. AR is up over 1400% in the last year.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Tokenization (RLY and RARI): above average returns. Social tokens RLY and RARI is for buy/sell NFTs.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;How&amp;amp;#39;s your portfolio doing? Are you happy with your choice of coins? Are you planning to buy or sell anything new? Let me know in the comment.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;*EDIT\&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;*&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I just do another deep dive into the list. Messari list doesn&amp;amp;#39;t list all the coins that Coinbase Venture had invested in.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/is9lcabjr5g81.png?width=838&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=576bf2479bae2ad14f36fd1dd2a145b99fd250e8&quot;&amp;gt;Here is another updated version from Coinbase Venture website&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;CV seems to focus more on the new trend now. One focus I could find is that now they stress on the important of NFT utility phase - so think beyond a picture of a rock that is sold for $1.3M&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/jwawkprtr5g81.png?width=833&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=afa00b8546378b047dfaddf2996313c646bd7195&quot;&amp;gt;Info from Coinbase blog&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For platform and developer tools, the focus is now shifted to Web3, with the tool kits that help the developers to make things happen. Also they pay attention to API such as Alchemy.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/nhx2c898s5g81.png?width=880&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=34195984e01d7fb927dc502569da11d537575c56&quot;&amp;gt;Info from Coinbase blog&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For more info please visit the Coinbase Ventures website. They have a full list of investments. When I have time I can actually look further into which coins do they invested in.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;**EDIT 2*\&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;*&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I could actually find another list of coins that Coinbase Venture had invested in. There are currently 38 coins (under &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Coinbase Ventures Portfolio Screener&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;). &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/g7k72evpq6g81.png?width=1919&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=8d942a57050fc809ddbd745cc84e1e47a01fed72&quot;&amp;gt;Coinbase Venture 38 coins - Portfolio Screener&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This list doesn&amp;amp;#39;t contain BTC or ETH but we all know they own a truckload of BTC and ETH already. Some other interesting picks:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Metaverse / Gaming - SAND - arguably one of the better games in the Metaverse now (stand out against a sea of garbage games)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Smart contracts - MINA, CTK&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Shared compute - LPT: which is kind of similar to THETA, focus on video infrastructure. It did have a pump in Nov 2021 (note not all alts have pumped crazily in Nov 2021)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Derivatives - SNX for Defi application. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

This is not the only similarity - back then BTC pumped from 35k to 39k within 14 hours, while yesterday we saw a pump from 37k to 41k in 9 hours.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This uptrend was short lived and BTC was above 40k for just 2 days, to crash even lower than previously in the next week.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is also worth noting that we are far from &amp;amp;quot;invalidating weeks of FUD&amp;amp;quot; (as one of the top post claims, the one about a potential short squeeze), because we are basically at the support level from just 2 weeks ago - after going below 45k in January, BTC was testing the 40k-41k support for a while, just to crash below it on 20th of January. This was just sixteen days ago!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The only positive aspect about current situation is that you can kind-of see a slight uptrend since hitting 33k on 24th of January when you zoom out, but this means as much as the current alignment of stars on the night sky.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Whether we go &amp;amp;quot;up only&amp;amp;quot; or continue the downtrend remains to be seen. Personally my bets are 50% on going up and 50% on going down, so as you see I have a pretty strong opinion about the current state of the market (;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Nearly always with the same amount, few exceptions when I got a bonus from work etc. Basically, I wanted to go all-in but didn&amp;amp;#39;t have any savings, so decided to buy with max amount that I can, every month from the salary. I kinda had the idea of stacking my way to a million dollars (or euros), however long it would take. Because the way I see Bitcoin, I have no doubt it&amp;amp;#39;s gonna happen. Sooner if I stack more, and later if stack less.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I saw stacking sats become a meme and people posting screenshots on Twitter. But I felt like the bigger picture was missing. How much can you achieve by simply stacking sats all the time? This is my idea of a blueprint. I stack with certain amount and have been doing it for a certain while. You can take a look at the progress and get and idea how it would work for you.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In short, its gonna take time. And its gonna require patience and nerves. Bitcoin is gonna test you, and there&amp;amp;#39;s no shortcuts to success. My advice: start stacking, keep stacking! Promise yourself to stack at least 4 years before you even think about giving up. I document my journey here in the blog. Enjoy reading and I hope you have great success stacking sats!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Isn&amp;amp;#39;t the internet just the metaverse? Or does it always require some sort of game like VR interface to count?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And what role does Blockchain play in the metaverse? Is it intended to support the persistence and the idea of one true metaverse? But whose Blockchain? Surely anyone can create their own Blockchain for their own metaverse? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Why are people buying virtual land in the metaverse? What utility does it have? And given it&amp;amp;#39;s just a simulation, the land itself is presumably infinite? So why pay for it?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Am I just an old grumpy man?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The way the network is built is pure genius and the bigger it gets, the more secure it becomes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In 2011, Dan Kaminsky, a leading Internet-security researcher, investigated the currency and was sure he would find major weaknesses. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Kaminsky is famous among hackers for discovering, in 2008, a fundamental flaw in the Internet which would have allowed a skilled coder to take over any Web site or even to shut down the Internet. Kaminsky alerted the Department of Homeland Security and executives at Microsoft and Cisco to the problem and worked with them to patch it. He is one of the most adept practitioners of “penetration testing,” the art of compromising the security of computer systems at the behest of owners who want to know their vulnerabilities.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Guess what he said when he tried to break Bitcoin?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;“When I first looked at the code, I was sure I was going to be able to break it. The way the whole thing was formatted was insane. Only the most paranoid, painstaking coder in the world could avoid making mistakes.”&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He thought he had identified nine ways to compromise the system and scoured Nakamoto’s code for an insertion point for his first attack. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But when he found the right spot, there was a message waiting for him. “Attack Removed,” it said. The same thing happened over and over, infuriating Kaminsky. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;“I came up with beautiful bugs. But every time I went after the code there was a line that addressed the problem.”&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He was like a burglar who was certain that he could break into a bank by digging a tunnel, drilling through a wall, or climbing down a vent, and on each attempt he discovered a freshly poured cement barrier with a sign telling him to go home. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;“I’ve never seen anything like it,”&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; Kaminsky said, still in awe.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;“Either there’s a team of people who worked on this or this guy is a genius.”&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Meaning crypto will eventually become legal tender if we keep up this pace (and will most probably be adopted faster than credit cards got adopted).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There are even crypto credit cards that are paving the way for crypto payment adoption. They’re so easy to acquire. Platforms like Binance and Coinbase offer them. I have mine from CoinOvy.
These crypto credit cards will be a great way to transition from digital payments to full crypto payments.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They only post FUD about Bitcoin/Crypto, articles full of lies and misinformation. But this great factual article is nowhere to be seen there:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As a major winter storm descends on Texas, crypto miners are powering down operations to help ease the burden on the state’s already beleaguered power grid. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The chief concern is that we might see a repeat of February 2021, when a deep freeze devastated large swaths of the state, leaving 10 million Texans without electricity and resulted in a multisystem meltdown that “was within minutes of a much more serious and potentially complete blackout.” Hundreds of people died amid the multiday outage. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Riot Blockchain, one of the biggest publicly traded crypto mining companies in America, began shutting down power to its Rockdale mine on Tuesday, a process that occurs in phases.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“As the storm has progressed, we have continued to decrease our power consumption by 98%-99%. So currently, we are only using 1%-2% of power,” said Trystine Payfer, Riot’s director of communications. Payfer told CNBC Riot will continue to manage its power usage as needed until there is “no extreme stress on the ERCOT grid.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Riot’s stock closed nearly 7% lower on Wednesday, and it is down over 31% year-to-date. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Several other crypto miners across Texas have followed suit in voluntarily curtailing energy consumption in the run-up to the arctic blast.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The CEO of Rhodium Enterprises, a fully integrated bitcoin miner using liquid-cooled infrastructure, tweeted that Texas-based bitcoin miners were curtailing their load starting Wednesday, in order to “help provide excess power reserves” for the storm. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“We are proud to help stabilize the grid and help our fellow Texans stay warm,” wrote Rhodium CEO Nathan Nichols.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Other crypto miners said they will respond in real-time to the needs of the grid.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The grid is called ERCOT, which is short for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, the organization tasked with operating it. To run smoothly, ERCOT requires a perfect balance between supply and demand. Having too much power and not enough buyers is just as bad as everyone wanting to fire up their air conditioning units on the same day in July.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Whinstone CEO Chad Harris takes CNBC on a tour of the largest bitcoin mine in North America.

For years, ERCOT has struggled with fluctuating energy prices and sporadic service, which is why it strikes deals with flexible energy buyers, like crypto miners. Through established “demand response” programs, ERCOT will actually pay major industrial users to cut power.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“They’re expecting the same kind of grid load as you would have at peak summertime, so they’ll likely curtail miners at some point on Friday or Saturday,” explained Fred Thiel, CEO of Marathon Digital, another major player in the U.S. mining industry.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitcoin miners specifically, and demand response more generally, are a powerful tool in the toolbox for grid management, according to Lee Bratcher, president of the Texas Blockchain Council.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Marathon’s Thiel tells CNBC that miners have been coordinating with ERCOT since last week to get ahead of any potential problems with the grid.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“Everybody wants to collaborate, everybody wants to voluntarily do whatever it takes to support ERCOT,” he said.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The question now is when the baseload that miners use (the baked-in energy demand from miners as a collective) is shut down and transferred back to the grid, does that provide the grid with what it needs to keep functioning as normal?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“This is a key test moment for the industry,” continued Thiel.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Whether crypto miners going offline en masse in one of the biggest crypto mining jurisdictions in the world will move the price of bitcoin, the answer is probably no.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The supply delta from changing the pace of mining is typically minimal, and any price moves in bitcoin or other major proof-of-work cryptocurrencies would likely have more to do with macro factors and overall risk-off behavior.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;WATCH NOW
VIDEO02:51
A war is brewing among states in the US to attract bitcoin miners
Big test for bitcoin miners
Many in the mining industry tell CNBC that the next few days are a high-stakes way of testing out whether the narrative of crypto miners being good for the grid bears out under pressure. The state’s growing crypto mining contingent ballooned after China banished all crypto miners last May.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“Bitcoin miners want to be good stewards of grid stability,” said Alex Brammer of Luxor Mining, a cryptocurrency pool built for advanced miners. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“We are incentivized financially but also from a political narrative, and therefore, regulatory perspective. We want to show the world we contribute to the health and resilience of the grid, and we know that all eyes will be on us throughout this first big test of the year,” continued Brammer.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That financial incentive is key. Miners are not altruistically opting to do the grid a solid by sometimes powering down some or all of its bitcoin miners to free up electricity for those in need. Instead, there are a lot of financial perks baked into its arrangement with the nonprofit organization that operates Texas’ grid. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“Imagine how much you would have to pay Amazon to say, ‘Hey, there’s too much demand for power. Please power down your data center,’” said bitcoin mining engineer Brandon Arvanaghi, who now runs Meow, a company that enables corporate treasury participation in crypto markets.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“But it can do that with bitcoin very easily, because all you have to do is pay the miners slightly more than what they would have made mining for bitcoin that hour,” continued Arvanaghi, who calls the setup a “a win-win.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If the grid operators pay the miners a penny more than they would have made from mining in any given hour, then they’ll gladly power down. And from Thiel’s experience, they get curtailment requests less than 3% of the time in the course of a year, which he estimates comes to about five to ten hours a month.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Even bitcoin miners that haven’t cut a deal with ERCOT sometimes voluntarily power down at times of peak consumption when prices shoot higher.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The price of power per hour is all over the place, routinely going negative.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Shaun Connell, the EVP of power at Lancium, tells CNBC that in 2020, the price of energy in West Texas was negative between 10% and 20% of the time. The price dips below zero when supply outpaces demand.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In 2021, the price of power per hour was negatively priced 9% of the time, while 5% of all hours peaked above $100. Extreme tails like the ones shown in the chart below aren’t a good thing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Scales
In 2021, had miners voluntarily cut back their uptime expectation from 100% to 95%, they would have slashed their per megawatt hour price from $178 to $25, according to data from Lancium, a Houston-based energy tech company that specializes in bitcoin mining. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Strategically timed energy curtailment proves especially vital for the Texas grid, which exists as its own little island. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Unlike the rest of the continental U.S. that belongs to either the Eastern or Western interconnection (the names of the two interconnected power grids linking states), 90% of Texas runs on ERCOT, a deregulated and independent network of energy providers that is not tethered to any other grid in the U.S. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While this competitive market often drives down the price of power as providers compete on cost to capture customers, it also means that there is less of a safety net baked into the grid. This presents problems in the face of calamitous events, such as a power shortage or a natural disaster, like the fatal winter storm in early 2021. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adding a “controllable load resource” like bitcoin miners to the grid acts as a sort of life insurance policy. It’s almost like a hedge against disaster.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And it’s no skin off the back of bitcoin miners. Bitcoin has no uptime requirement, nor is the gear worn down by regularly powering off and on. It’s pretty much a win, win.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“That’s the beauty of bitcoin — it’s something no other industry can really do,” Arvanaghi told CNBC. “It’s very synergistic.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Not everyone agrees
Not all are convinced that bitcoin miners are the solution.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“Miners are a strain on the grid, not a help,” said Ben Hertz-Shargel of Wood Mackenzie, a provider of commercial intelligence for the world’s natural resources sector. Hertz-Shargel is concerned that bitcoin mining would only raise peak demand, ultimately adding stress to the system.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hertz-Shargel predicts that bitcoin could more than double demand growth in ERCOT’s territory, but unlike pro-crypto Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, Hertz-Shargel doesn’t think that additional demand is a good thing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;″The analogy I like to use is that if you start smoking two packs a day and then cut back to one pack on holidays, that doesn’t make smoking good for your health,” he says.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hertz-Shargel argues that ERCOT should be focused on grid improvements to make it easier to get power from solar and wind farms to big consumption centers, and that bitcoin miners aren’t the right way to deal with demand fluctuations. Instead, he argues, “the intermittency of renewables should be met with demand response from societally-beneficial loads, like industrial facilities, commercial buildings, and residential air conditioners — or energy storage.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But ERCOT interim CEO Brad Jones thinks bitcoin miners can be helpful.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Jones has been touring the state and hosting public events to answer questions from Texans about the electric grid. Besides winter weather, the impact of cryptocurrency mining on the grid is a common question.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“I’m pro bitcoin...but I’m too risk averse to be an investor in bitcoin,” Jones told a crowd of residents in Frisco, Texas in December. The ERCOT chief went on to explain the mutually beneficial relationship between the grid and bitcoin miners.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“A lot of these solar and wind can produce power down to a negative power range, negative $23 per megawatt hour,” Jones said. “These bitcoins see that as a great opportunity. They can get paid to use power. And that’s why they’re coming to the state. But that’s not necessarily bad.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Jones makes the point that negative power isn’t healthy for the market. Bitcoin miners “soak up” some of that negative power, and when the cost of electricity gets slightly higher than what they’re willing to pay for it (around $100, according to Jones), they shut off.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“So I think it’s really a valuable potential resource for us.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Because literally anything can happen, dummy.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is just a simple reminder that just because a post makes you feel good, doesn&amp;amp;#39;t make it true. And just because you don&amp;amp;#39;t agree with a post, doesn&amp;amp;#39;t make it wrong.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Prices fell for a couple months and this place was a ghost town. We&amp;amp;#39;ve seen a couple good days and everybody is an expert again.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A vast majority of the 4.4M members of this sub are not experts, have very little experience, have never read a whitepaper, could not explain blockchain to their parents, and have very little skin in the game. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Not everybody, but most.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Great analyses can go unnoticed, and garbage can be upvoted to the moon.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Its kinda frustrating seeing how people instantly think of JPEGs once you
mention NFTs.

NFTs can be used in MANY ways. Tickets, product listing, identity verification
and much more.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;NFTs can be used in MANY ways. Tickets, product listing, identity verification and much more.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And yes I understand that some of these expensive jpegs like Bored Ape come with services and exclusivity but I think they’re super inflated in price. Some projects like Last Hopium offer literally the same exclusivity in contacts and experiences for much more comprehendible prices.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;People should really start focusing more on the applications that NFT technology can be used in instead of paying attention to overinflated jpegs.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
