Bitcoin got constantly rejected at ~31k the past days and it does not look like anything is making a fast recovery just now.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto prices, as every other financial asset prices, are completly dependent on the state of the human psychology and that&amp;amp;#39;s dependent on how the world is doing. The past months we have just been adding more and more macro-economic tensions. Starting with FED rate hikes, Consumer Inflation, Russia-Ukraine to now China supply issues. Also Don&amp;amp;#39;t forget that Covid is still here.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It just does not seem like any of those will get better any time soon. Covid stays still, Russia Ukraine is having no progress in peace, FED won&amp;amp;#39;t stop till inflation is down. Obviously things could change and Crypto pumps to the moon, there is no certainity, but the probability is that things will keep worse before they get better.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

So, there should be a professional explanation about their reserves? Nope.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The entire article is pretty much useless:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Given the recent losses UST investors suffered, many users may be questioning if they can trust Tether USD₮ given the spectacular collapse of UST.   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thankfully, all one needs to do is look at the history and track record of Tether USD₮.   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Tether USD₮ has been relied on as the primary form of dollar-based liquidity in the crypto market for many years and the crypto market has not been without its share of dramatic crashes! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Like, what is this? They are saying they should be trusted entirely based on their track record, with no other explanation whatsoever??&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The first half of the page is useless, so what about the second half? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The second half of the article is titled &amp;amp;quot;How Does an Algorithmic Stablecoin Work?&amp;amp;quot; and it&amp;amp;#39;s ALL they are talking about. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While UST is referred to as a stablecoin, it has nothing in common with collateralized stablecoins like Tether USD₮. UST is an algorithmic stablecoin. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Again, they are using UST as a scapegoat instead of addressing their reserves or any explanation of how they maintain their peg. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://tether.to/en/how-tether-usdt-is-able-to-maintain-its-peg-when-other-stablecoins-fall/?fbclid=IwAR38zybf2sEcEoRfH2avk8IxmZUe6R77AGpceIykVihyMK7GIHnx4ON9VP8&quot;&amp;gt;Source&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The entire article is a joke and you should go read it for yourself.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Some have gone so far to call tether a cancer that must die for crypto to ascend to some magical new ath. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Personally, I acknowledge that they aren’t a model coin and do have suspicious backing/audit history, but I’m not rooting for their outright implosion. I seriously think people underestimate the ripple effects throughout crypto that would happen if USDT went bust. Something like 60-70% of all BTC volume is done through USDT and it’s a massive part of crypto volume in general. It this goes up in smoke, then exchanges can go under and volume would dry up considerably. This would lead to massive price drops and liquidity crises that would give governments free reign to completely shape crypto with whatever regulations they see fit. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I’d prefer for USDT to slowly be replaced by USDC/DAI/etc and be less influential rather than the above scenario. Why do so many people think that USDT going bust would only cause short term pain?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Disclaimer: been around since 2017 and yes, I know about Mt. Gox. Something like this would be worse Imo.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It seems anyone who was in the crypto space saw the obvious Ponzi scheme of Terra Luna for what it was. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How could this information be beneficial? These people called out Terra Luna while it was still on its upward meteoric rise. Basically they didn’t buy the hype. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If they were smart enough to be skeptical then, and not just be skeptical but pinpoint the exact reason Terra Luna would self-destruct a few months into the future, it’s probably a good idea to follow them and see what they’re saying now. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you go to their website you can see their current circulating supply with the same latency:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/1vtvjvqez2091.png?width=1298&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=390553ce99b2cdb44d12eb745cf9b3505c77c9aa&quot;&amp;gt;The last update date is not true - it&amp;amp;#39;s actually May 14 and the supply exactly the same as it was 3 days ago&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So they&amp;amp;#39;re not only not reporting the supply, but they&amp;amp;#39;re also lying about updating it. The only reason why would they do that is because their supply fell significantly in these 3 days and they don&amp;amp;#39;t want more people to follow. If they didn&amp;amp;#39;t hide the 8B that dropped during 5 days, how much are they hiding from these 3 days?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Tether is getting more and more shady with everyday. They will probably try to buy back some of the withdrawn Tether with their reserves, decreasing their actual reserves and shooting themselves in the foot further.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The day Bitcoin hit it&amp;amp;#39;s bottom of $3,236.36&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Day after the Bottom, starting the ride to the top&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Surprisingly the comments don&amp;amp;#39;t look that different from what you see today, some saying it&amp;amp;#39;s going to fall some more, others saying this time it&amp;amp;#39;s different. The one thing that is clear, nobody knew that bitcoin would not reach $3.236.36 again, this was the best time to buy.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I’m sure I could of timed it better. But my plan is to stake what’s available of these and cold storage the rest. The plan would be to revisit all these purchases between 2024-2026. If they’re still alive either hodl longer or take profits if they’ve made good gains. Some are good alts that I picked and some were just random purchases off Coinbase that I could get a lot of tokens/coins for a few dollars just for fun. I’ll break down my current portfolio below with the gamble portfolio as well.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How the $1000 was spent:
Avax 11%
Algo 9%
Polygon 9%
Enjin 9%
Cardano 9%
Gala 8%
Cosmos 7%
Chiliz 6%
Dot 5%
Tezos 5%
Doge 4%
Anchor 4%
Bat 2%
Fet 2%
Uni 1%
Lrc 1%
Spell 1%
Jasmy 1%
1inch 1%
Perp 1%
Wluna 1%
Loom 1%
Voyager 1%
Shping 1%&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Real portfolio:
BTC 52% ETH 32% Link 9% Sol 4% HNT 2% Amp 1% also have some random coinbase earn coins and like 120 CRO that was given. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Like I said my plan is to hodl and stake all these for the longterm hoping one of these random alts will pull the next Sol. Wanting that $1k spent to at least make itself back in the future (I know they could all go to $0). Let me know your thoughts on this strategy. I may add some more alts over time but in very small increments like $10-100 per purchase. Reason I picked most of these is cause of ease of purchase off CB I know of better alts on other exchanges didn’t want to go through hassle to buy them though. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Have you ever bought a random alt and forgot about it for years to come back and find it mooned?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I even bought a hardware wallet several years ago but was too nervous to actually transfer my coins to it. I figured a big company like Coinbase is probably better at security than I am, so what&amp;amp;#39;s the real risk? A post here last week was what finally pushed me over: pointing out that in bankruptcy, Coinbase could (and probably would) liquidate my coins to pay creditors. While I don&amp;amp;#39;t think it&amp;amp;#39;s likely that my Coinbase vault would get hacked, I do think there is a much bigger chance for Coinbase to do something dumb on the business side and go bankrupt during some particularly bad market volatility. So I bit the bullet and transferred my coins - other than the excruciating 30 seconds between initiating the send at waiting for it to show up on the other side it was very painless. TL;DR I finally pulled my coins off of Coinbase, and you should too&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This becomes even more suspicious as LFG and other operators are not releasing evidence of their transactions where they claim they sold coins to market makers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The initial research has been done by blockchain analysis software provider Elipsis, and shows the possible time of the trades and are documented here: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/elliptic/status/1525246959161905153&quot;&amp;gt;https://twitter.com/elliptic/status/1525246959161905153&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The LFG wallets were emptied on 9/10 May, as UST began to collapse - purportedly to to support the UST price&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However today, LFG revealed they sold their holdings as below:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/LFG_org/status/1526126708193054721&quot;&amp;gt;https://twitter.com/LFG_org/status/1526126708193054721&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Transferred 52,189 BTC to trade with a counterparty, net of an excess of 5,313 $BTC that they have returned, for an aggregate 1,515,689,462 UST&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This implies 52189 minus 5313 btc was sold for 1515689462 UST , i.e. the BTC price at the time of sale/loan was : $32334.01&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sold 33,206 BTC for an aggregate 1,164,018,521 UST&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/LFG_org/status/1526126713062576128&quot;&amp;gt;https://twitter.com/LFG_org/status/1526126713062576128&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This gives us a BTC price of $35054.46 per BTC at the time of this transaction!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;LFG apparently used the proceeds of the BTC sale to market buy UST on exchanges in an effort to support its peg. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you look at BTC charts, the price of BTC during 9th to 10th May was around $34200 to $29700 range. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This means those who were on the opposite side of LFG&amp;amp;#39;s BTC sale for UST buys (published by LFG themselves) seemed to have got a much higher conversion rate, than what the UST&amp;amp;#39;s crashing price reflected! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;According to the price of UST on Coinbase, we can see that on 9th, UST ranged from 99.6c to as low as 75c! And on 10th, UST opened at 93c and fell to as low as 62c! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Those who were on the other side of these initial trades were able to redeem their UST almost at a $1 peg, as LFG bought their coins. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Who were at the end of these trades, only LFG and other insiders seem to know. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This whole thing is murky af, and this kind of suspicions is enough to call for an audit of the entire transaction history by a reputed audit firm. Around $40 BN worth assets were burnt to the ground in this mess, it is not a small amount by any means. The Mcap destroyed in this is comparable to the mcap of Lehmann Brothers. Whats worse is that UST mcap was actually dollar denominated debt held by many retail users. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;A police report has been filed yesterday by a Singapore citizen. He claims that he knew of more than 1000 Singaporeans that invested in LUNA and UST. UST was sold as the stablecoin that will remain pegged to $1 but it dropped to $0.1 because the ponzi scam collapsed. LUNA became worthless overnight. A total of $32 Billion dollars is lost.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
