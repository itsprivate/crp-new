&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is exactly what the whole Luna 2.0 situation feels like. People lost millions and now they are investing in a shitcoin in the hope to get that millions back.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;But there was an airdrop!? So they do&amp;amp;#39;nt invest?!&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yea, but in order for the coin to be worth something, other people will have to invest and put money into it, and there are people that are actively doing so. These are most likely the same people that already were invested in Luna before and want to make more gains to cover their losses.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But they are gonna lose all of it. And there are already people celebrating the new blockchain by making claims like &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;biggest airdrop ever&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; or &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;most decentralized blockchain&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; etc. People will never learn...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Five days after mining block 0, Satoshi mined block 9. Unlike the first 8 blocks, the BTC rewards from block 9 &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;did&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;not&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;go unspent.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;  Satoshi would ultimately send some BTC from the following wallet:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;Block 9 - January 08, 2009 at 9:54 PM CST
Mined by → 12cbQLTFMXRnSzktFkuoG3eHoMeFtpTu3S (50 BTC - spent) 
&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Three days later, Satoshi sent 10 BTC to Hal Finney, shown by the following transaction:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;12cbQLTFMXRnSzktFkuoG3eHoMeFtpTu3S → 10 BTC → 1Q2TWHE3GMdB6BZKafqwxXtWAWgFt5Jvm3
&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Below is a &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;screenshot of Hal Finney&amp;amp;#39;s Bitcoin wallet in 2009&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.  On the second to last row, you can see that he received 10 BTC from the address, 1Q2TWHE3GMdB6BZKafqwxXtWAWgFt5Jvm3, aka Satoshi.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/yntglslqm4391.jpg?width=960&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=8496c8f3c593167a03342280003531e5c9f7513c&quot;&amp;gt;The Original Bitcoin Client (2009)&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This transaction from Satoshi to Hal Finney is special. The first transaction of eventual billions to come:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/rplq2q6xm4391.png?width=887&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=3877697abaf675548fa2c2ed4d451ba33fa1705b&quot;&amp;gt;First Peer-to-Peer Transaction on Bitcoin Network&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The next day, Satoshi sent four different addresses some Bitcoin.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;  The identities behind these four addresses remain unknown.  Possibly, he sent it to the next four people who downloaded the BTC client.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;13HtsYzne8xVPdGDnmJX8gHgBZerAfJGEf, 1LzBzVqEeuQyjD2mRWHes3dgWrT9titxvq 
1DUDsfc23Dv9sPMEk5RsrtfzCw5ofi5sVW, 1ByLSV2gLRcuqUmfdYcpPQH8Npm8cccsFg 
&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The wallet Satoshi used to send the first P2P Bitcoin transaction&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, as well as distribute some BTC to other people afterward, is still holding some BTC.  The wallet has received a total of 195.4 BTC ($5,828,935) and sent a total of 177 BTC ($5,279,025). It &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;holds 18.4 BTC as of today&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; ($549,910).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There are &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;other documented Satoshi-owned wallets visible on the blockchain&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, such as &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;1PhUXucRd8FzQved2KGK3g1eKfTHPGjgFu&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; or &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;1NSwywA5Dvuyw89sfs3oLPvLiDNGf48cPD&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, both owned by Satoshi based on emails.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I wanted to just focus on the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;earliest Satoshi-controlled Bitcoin wallets&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; today, but there are &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;other Satoshi wallets, traceable on the Blockchain too.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;  Satoshi has many untraceable Bitcoin wallets too.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I hope maybe someone found this interesting, but if not, I enjoyed putting together this already known information on a single Reddit post.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;There is more to this rabbit hole, namely&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;just some guy&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;living in Malta, but that&amp;amp;#39;s for another day ...&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Update #1: Initial post&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;At the beginning of May 2022, investors in Anchor protocol panicked and withdrew their funds ($15B) during a bank run. UST (Terra stable coin) unpegged. The Terra ecosystem collapsed. 50 billion has been lost (1). Some investors are devastated, some are ruined, some of them even committed suicide.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Meanwhile, Kucoin exchange platform has manipulated the UST market to earn more than 33 million dollars and have impoverished their own clients.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;I will detail in this post how Kucoin took advantage of the Terra crisis to manipulate the market in its own benefit--how hundreds of Kucoin clients have lost funds and how I personally lost 540,184$ because of their market manipulation.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I will detail, as well, how Kucoin lied and hid what they were doing and how they banned dozens of customers on their Telegram customer service as soon as some of them published proof of Kucoin&amp;amp;#39;s market manipulation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For information, Kucoin is one of the biggest crypto exchange platform. Kucoin raised $150M from Jump Crypto with Circle Ventures, IDG Capital and Matric Partners and has been founded by Michael Gan, Eric Don, Top Lan, Kent Li, John Lee, Jack Zhu, and Linda Lin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;****&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Initial situation: I stacked all of my savings resulted from my professional activity on Anchor, and UST started to unpeg&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;December 2021, I decided to invest all of my assets in Anchor Protocol (that was obviously a big mistake). Almost 2 million us dollars I have made in 10 years of hard work with my web marketing company. I thought Anchor was solid, and UST would never unpeg for more than few hours. All of my assets were held through Anchor. I planned to buy an apartment in Paris at the end of this year but this dream will never come true.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On 8th May 2022, Anchor protocol investors started to considerably withdraw their funds. I withdrew 1,949,390UST and deposited them on my two Kucoin accounts. I made an order to exchange all my UST for USDT at $1 (that was probably my biggest mistake. That price would never have been reached).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On 9th may, for the first time, UST unpegged dramatically down to $0,76.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On 10th may, Terra decided to burn $1,5M in BTC to support UST. UST touched $0,93 before going back to $0,73.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On 11th may, 11h00(UTC) UST went down drastically to $0,30.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At this moment, after reading the white paper and everything about Terra&amp;amp;#39;s situation, I made my opinion : Terra was about to collapse. The panic was too high. UST would never reach $1 again. I made calculations. By selling all my UST at $0,84, I would &amp;amp;quot;only&amp;amp;quot; lose my previous profits thanks to the protocol. I thought it was the price to pay to be sure not to lose 10 years of personal savings. I placed 15 orders to sell around $0,84 on my Kucoin main account waiting to see how the market would react.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/6l34rie881391.png?width=1105&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=f5770e238a38941ea075f4a0e98ea83175c968ad&quot;&amp;gt;My orders on Kucoin to try to sell my UST around $0,84&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/hy0g8aa981391.png?width=1100&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=96799146c180a4e45989487902c96219bd8bf7a3&quot;&amp;gt;My orders on Kucoin to try to sell my UST around $0,84&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/ktmeqi1a81391.png?width=1105&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=03370b6311c879afb49482d7ccffc963c46ae252&quot;&amp;gt;My orders on Kucoin to try to sell my UST around $0,84&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;****&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Kucoin decided to lock UST withdrawals to manipulate the market&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On 11th may, 11h19, Kucoin decided to close UST withdrawals (2). They were arguing some fake congestion problems on the blockchain.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/ktivxyuh81391.jpg?width=603&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=6ec0b2718d4bcd7457ef0bedf0cbdf13dbe86344&quot;&amp;gt;Kucoin locked UST &amp;amp;amp; LUNA Withdrawals&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Inevitably, the UST price deviated from the global market price. The UST was at that time trading 30% below the price of all other platforms (Kraken, Binance, Huobi, Coinbase, FTX, Gate.io...).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On 11th may, 20h00, UST reached my target price of $0,84 across all competitors, including Kraken. By comparison, the price was $0,59 on Kucoin. At that moment, I had the strong will to sell all of my UST for $0,84 and end this nightmare. With 1,949,390UST I was supposed to save 1,637,487USDT. (If I took the decision to deposit my UST on Kraken instead of K#####!)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/m066h4yi81391.png?width=1048&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=9e3d2b7d94548a636cf119877368e8eb70d1b327&quot;&amp;gt;UST reached $0,8490 on Kraken (and barely $0,60 on Kucoin)&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I contacted Kucoin customer service on Telegram and I realized that hundreds people were complaining for the same exact reason. Many of them, publishing proof that Kucoin was making arbitration, were kicked and banned from the chat (I will detail everything about it later in this post).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On 11th may, 21h58, I sent a message to Kucoin support :&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/ovzwd3wm81391.png?width=757&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=d67b4c84aca838860dd3b8b844df5564dae22703&quot;&amp;gt;I sent a ticket to Kucoin support that never answers&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On 11th may, 22:24, Kucoin finally unlocked UST withdrawals. But it was too late. UST had already fallen sharply to $0,65 (and would very soon fall to $0,20).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On 11th may, from 22:27 to 22:39, I withdrew all my UST to Kraken.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On 11th may, from 22:40 to 02:05 (D+1), I exchanged my 1,949,390UST for 1,097,303USDT for an average price of $0,56.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I lost (1637487-1097303)= $540,184 because of Kucoin’s manipulation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;****&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Kucoin made arbitrations for 11 hours&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There is no doubt that Kucoin had willingly locked the UST withdrawal to make arbitration on the market and cash in the 30% difference between the UST’s value on the Kucoin platform versus their fair market value. And they did exactly the same with LUNA (LUNC now).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/nbuyhugo81391.png?width=594&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=b04f135c42f12678cb7b8bd1a327a090cd3d15a9&quot;&amp;gt;Many posts on Twitter complained about Kucoin manipulation&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;By locking UST withdrawals, Kucoin created for itself an incredibly profitable situation. Kucoin bought UST 30% below the price on their own platform. And then sold them to the real price, 30% higher, on any other platforms.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After this, they just needed to loop and repeat the exact same operation. This, during 11 hours.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Let&amp;amp;#39;s prove it as everything is public on the blockchain :&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On 8th may, my main Terra wallet made the deposit of 1,715,000UST on Kucoin Terra wallet : terra14l46jrdgdhaw4cejukx50ndp0hss95ekt2kfmw (3)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This same wallet, terra14l46jrdgdhaw4cejukx50ndp0hss95ekt2kfmw, owned by Kucoin, made 13 withdrawals DURING the supposed &amp;amp;quot;congestion&amp;amp;quot; for a substantial total of 112,436,410UST (4)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cashing in the 30% difference with other platforms.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;So Kucoin made approximately $33,730,923 of profit by manipulating the market and making arbitration.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All arbitration operations are tracked and available on the blockchain (detailed calculations are available in the sources at the bottom of this post) : &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://finder.terra.money/mainnet/address/terra14l46jrdgdhaw4cejukx50ndp0hss95ekt2kfmw&quot;&amp;gt;https://finder.terra.money/mainnet/address/terra14l46jrdgdhaw4cejukx50ndp0hss95ekt2kfmw&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;****&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Kucoin lied and hid what they were doing&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They consistently kicked and banned every customer that brought evidence of their arbitration operations on the customer service on Telegram.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/srdzdgwp81391.png?width=595&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=bacb0594c642406b8a2376c9d1532adcfc8853f9&quot;&amp;gt;Kucoin Telegram admin banned \&amp;amp;quot;disturbing customers\&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Customer service never stopped to argue that the platform was under maintenance. This could have been true if they didn&amp;amp;#39;t, themselves, make 13 withdrawals during this time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It seems that this is part of Kucoin&amp;amp;#39;s business plan as they wrote in their terms of conditions: &amp;amp;quot;Kucoin may agree (but is not obligated to) your request to transfer funds&amp;amp;quot; (5).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/gbe9aj0u81391.png?width=940&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=6953aabd3b577be56fa4ef514f378bf7f4603165&quot;&amp;gt;Kucoin is not obligated to transfer your funds regarding terms of agreement&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Moreover Kucoin seems to have a habit of breaching financial rules and violate customers’ rights. They are already sued by Ontario regulation in Canada (6)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Kucoin doesn&amp;amp;#39;t even state where the company is domiciled and regulated in their terms of agreement (7)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;****&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Conclusion&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Kucoin manipulated the market for 11 hours against any financial laws and authorities rules.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Kucoin cheated to make substantial profits while some of their investors were losing their life savings.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They did it. They also did it with Luna (another cryptocurrency from Terra ecosystem). We know they did it, they still are doing it, and they will continue to do it on others cryptocurrencies as well.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I think this is our duty, as crypto holders, to spread the word, to make public those acts, to ban those actions, in order to build a better and fairer crypto ecosystem.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;If you were also victim of Kucoin&amp;amp;#39;s manipulations (UST, Luna or whatever), DM me. You have rights. And we gonna fight against Kucoin through our collective action and the appeal in front of the regulatory an criminal authorities.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Solana have officially confirmed its down yet again, and that all operators should prepare for a restart. According to them assets are &amp;amp;quot;safe&amp;amp;quot; though they cannot be accessed. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/61puj3poq1391.jpg?width=1272&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=2c40d71a2eb4487b1204d649f529eb014b18a1eb&quot;&amp;gt;Restart plz&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As usual, the Solana devs are online more than the network itself.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Growing up I never forgot how they gave us the Euro when I was a kid in the early 2000s. Initially for every &amp;amp;#39;deutsche mark&amp;amp;#39; we got 0.5 Euros, but I was super confused when my parents told me that their salary got divided by 2 (x0.5), but consumer prices went back to the &amp;amp;quot;old&amp;amp;quot; deutsche mark prices within one year - meaning as an end result they didn&amp;amp;#39;t get divided, but salaries stagnated. I was ~8 years old at the time, didn&amp;amp;#39;t understand what was going on, but felt that something super strange happened. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In 2008 the financial crisis/euro crisis hit, people where afraid, the media went crazy and when I was ~14 years old I needed to learn that I can&amp;amp;#39;t get interest at the bank when I want to save my money for hard times in the future.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I finished school, went to university, studied medicine, did my PhD and looked at the world: House prices doubled!
I realized that even as a physician in Germany I will not be able to buy a house in my home town without being indebted until the rest of my life, will not have the financial freedom to pursue projects which might take time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I got depressed, I questioned everything, why do I even get up in the morning? My whole life I tried to do everything right, I saved for my future family, I studied, did research, but there was no chance of getting out of the debt-machinery.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then I discovered Bitcoin. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I learned about austrian economics, time preference and how fiat is affecting every single aspect of our lives, including morals, and the general perspective we look at our life&amp;amp;#39;s.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I pray to God that Bitcoin will continue to transform the life&amp;amp;#39;s of people on the globe, like it did mine.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I was lost, but now I&amp;amp;#39;m found.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thanks to everybody building and supporting the Bitcoin network.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The final in Paris was briefly delayed due chaotic scenes outside the Stade de France. The French police tear gassed fans (including families) that showed up to stadium with fake tickets.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;According to the French interrior minster, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Gérald Darmanin,&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; 30.000-40.000 Liverpool fans showed up with fake tickets at the stadium. According to the French minister about 70% of the presented tickets by Liverpool fans were fake.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/30/liverpool-fans-caused-initial-problems-in-paris-says-french-sports-minister&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/30/liverpool-fans-caused-initial-problems-in-paris-says-french-sports-minister&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Liverpool player, Andy Robertson, stated that fans with valid tickets were also rejected from entering the stadium. A friend of Robertson got told his ticket was fake, which is suprising since the Liverpool player gave official tickets issued by Liverpool to his mate&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Problem:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fans cannot easily verify and proof that their ticket are valid.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Solution:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;An &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Open Blockchain&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; provides a trusted source for both ticket holders and organizers. The transfer of NFTs from the initial sale to resale is stored on the blockchain immutably so that all parties can prove the ticket’s authenticity. In cases where the resale of tickets is forbidden, NFTs can be developed as nontransferable, not to be moved to another buyer.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What is the opinion of &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/cc&quot;&amp;gt;r/cc&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; on the chaotic scenes outside the stadium on Saturday night? Would this be prevented if an open blockchain ticketing solution was used, where fans can easily verify their tickets&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Yesterday (I believe) someone posted a study claiming that the average crypto investor knows a lot about crypto, but a lot less about our financial system than the average stock investor and this comes as no surprise.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can roast me for this one, but I&amp;amp;#39;ve just made a graph showing what&amp;amp;#39;s happening:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/o4hlqoafuy291.png?width=472&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=c533be63c07d0a13c03f7ef1396f5a8163ad6999&quot;&amp;gt; zero-sum situation, crypto style&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Investor A makes a quick buck, the early adopter got his big gains for free and investor B... well, he&amp;amp;#39;s paying for it the moment he&amp;amp;#39;s buying his investment and holding his bag.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A lot of people thought they&amp;amp;#39;ve lost their money in Luna and it just got burnt. No, it isn&amp;amp;#39;t. Your money now belongs to those who became rich or at least had gains selling LUNA in the right moment.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As long as we don&amp;amp;#39;t have a real product connected to the real world (where other people are willing to pay money for), we do not have more than a zero-sum game.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

But I still think, he is doing a lot for the crypto space in general and should be respected for it. Stay with me, I will explain.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;First about his criticism:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Overpromising: 
100%, but this is not a exklusive problem but a general crypto space problem. It’s exactly the same with almost all other crypto leaders like Vitalik and Eth 2.0. BUT Cardano and CH have delivered. It took them way longer than expected, but they are exactly there now where they wanted to be with the project and this is more than some other chains. Keep in mind that Cardano always was a research first Project and invented a whole new architecture from the ground up and not copying others like many other projects. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Talking bad about other projects: 
I’m gonna side with CH here. Most of what CH have said about other projects is true. And the situation the crypto market is currently in is proof. He said Eth will have to solve many problems for a long time, because they came out as fast as possible and not research first. He criticized Solana for the reasons everyone does, but did it before it was common. And this is the case for most of his criticism, a technical analysis of other projects and where their problems are (even with Luna). Ppl just get offended by it that’s all. He was almost always right in the end. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Acting triggered:
100%. This part I also really don’t like about him. I think he feels attacked very easily, I guess because ppl were trash talking him a lot back in the Eth days (and after) and ppl trash talked Ada because of the slow progress in the early days. But still, 100% valid.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Math Background: 
Same with acting triggered. I think it’s not okay and valid, but he still is a great mathematician and has proven many times. Like the time he created one of the most successful and researched backed Crypto projects out there.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So and what is actually good about him ? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;His Videos:
Yes. Have you ever watched one ? It’s so funny, every time a CH Video is posted here, ppl be like “I don’t like him but I agree with him on that”. Always. Why ? Because almost all of his videos are like that. This negative stuff about him is like 1% of the content. The other 99% is a smart visionary man who can talk very logical and clear. He can explain hard topics very easily and has been right most of the times about his claims. Oh I’m just a fanboy ? Pick a random video from his channel and watch it. Most Ppl only hear those rumors about him and never actually listen to what this guy is saying. Watch the Fox News interview with him. We all hate Fox News, but how is him explain some boomers crypto currency a bad thing ? Listen to the interview, come back here and tell
Me how this is not a smart guy being out there and lobbying for us. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Lobbyism:
He is out there and doing the job. With the same quality than in his videos. Explaining crypto, increasing the chance when regulation is hitting it won’t be bad. And he is also lobbying for crypto in general, for their fundamentals, not just ada. Where do you disagree with him ? Again listen and than again tell me where this is not a excellent job he is doing. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;His vision:
So again, how is this not exactly what we want ? Many Ppl here would agree with 99% what CH says and still act like he is just a random Crypto dude making sketchy things. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Him:
Yes I do like him as a person. Dude is talking a lot about mindfulness, general research, global events and possible solutions, philosophy, math , culture and many more. Again if ppl here would actually consume content from him, I believe most ppl would even like him, find it interesting to listen to and agree with him on many things. But most ppl only know him through some headlines or hate comments and that’s it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The truth is most ppl here know nothing about Charles and just heard of one of those negative things from above. While there is a lot of valid criticism against him, he is still doing a lot for the crypto space and saying a lot of smart things. It’s okay to not like him, but at least don’t spread the idea that he is some kind of snakeoil salesman which is just an absurd claim for what he has done and does. He is an important brain for the whole crypto space and don’t deserve the amount of hate and false claims he gets. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This will probably being downvoted into oblivion because it’s an unpopular opinion here, still I do encourage ppl to watch some of his recent videos.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

That is a place where people are supposed to know what they are talking about, and practically everyone there thinks that finance, means budgeting. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Financing has been around for thousands of years, and yet people have very little basic knowledge about even the concept of money, let alone the cost of it. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It gets so bad that I can&amp;amp;#39;t help but to sit there and say that it feels like I&amp;amp;#39;m &amp;amp;quot;early&amp;amp;quot; to the concept of interest rates. When in reality, the stupidity of the people are what the central planners are counting on. They aren&amp;amp;#39;t hiding their theft from regular people, they are just operating out of another dimension.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I wonder if Bitcoin will suffer eternally due to the people that it benefits, having no real interest in learning why or how, and the people that do understand it, all have much more to gain from gaming the system.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Rant over. This will likely be seen by 4 people, but I needed to get it off my chest.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The coin has seen an insane increase over the past couple months.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TRON has recently launched its algorithmic stablecoin &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usdd/&quot;&amp;gt;USDD&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. The algorithm governing the stablecoin’s dollar-peg is an arbitrage trade between USDD and TRX, Tron&amp;amp;#39;s network’s native token. &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Hmm... this reminds me of something but I can&amp;amp;#39;t put my finger on it....&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now here&amp;amp;#39;s this week&amp;amp;#39;s best offer! &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/a/JoFQgSH&quot;&amp;gt;You can earn up to 57% through sun.io&amp;amp;#39;s LP!&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; What a great deal.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;According to &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://defillama.com/peggedassets/stablecoins&quot;&amp;gt;Defillama&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; USDD is #10 stablecoin by market cap, with a 20% increase over the past week, this figure is up from $90 million recorded during its day of launch on &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;May 5, 2022&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Hmm... I have a vouge memory of something that happened in early May 2022...&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Oh and we haven&amp;amp;#39;t even checked the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;project&amp;amp;#39;s founder, Justin Sun.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Let&amp;amp;#39;s get started:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Justin Sun launched TRON&amp;amp;#39;s whitepaper during the ICO craze in 2017, days before China&amp;amp;#39;s ban on ICO&amp;amp;#39;s. He raised $70 million and left the country. Sun had been &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;tipped off by Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, the founder and CEO of Binance.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Does this also sound familiar....? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On top of that. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://coincentral.com/community-accuses-tron-plagiarizing-whitepaper/&quot;&amp;gt;it&amp;amp;#39;s been also reported that he copy pasted the project&amp;amp;#39;s whitepaper from another coin&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. This only adds to the pile of cards that his so called &amp;amp;quot;algorithmic stablecoin&amp;amp;quot; is a scam waiting to collapse.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is no coincidence that Justin also left China, days after the ICO ban was announced.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On top of all that, it&amp;amp;#39;s been reported that:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He hosted a ton of fake giveaways in 2019 announcing fake winners and retracting prizes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He announced fake partnerships with big organizations such as Liverpool F.C., who have denied connections.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s been reported that Justin has sold most of his TRON coins after the ICO and bought a large chunk of ETH. Some say he owns more ETH than the projects&amp;amp;#39; Co-Founder Vitalik.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/c/22947663/justin-sun-tron-cryptocurrency-poloniex&quot;&amp;gt;You can read more here&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So, what do we make of all these? Justin Sun, the creator of TRX and USDD, not only literally copy pasted everything, he has also been involved in a huge amount of sketchy dealings and scams. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My hope is that people like Justin and projects like LUNA and TRX are wiped off entirely from the market, for this is the only way to move forward and build something meaningful.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

And when I say &amp;amp;quot;in depth&amp;amp;quot;, I&amp;amp;#39;m not kidding: journalist Laura Shin gives an almost daily description of the days of Vitalik Buterin and other developers for the period 2013-2018. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;She interviewed hundreds of people and consulted thousands of documents of all kinds, both on the blockchain and in official reports from the Ethereum Foundation, to paint a picture of this historic crypto moment.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The book came out last February, I received it in early April, and I just finished reading it. Here is five things I learned!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;1-Crypto is fundamentally a chaotic universe and full of drama&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The first months of Ethereum were marked by disputes, dissension, power plays and total chaos. Developers bickered with financiers, financiers bickered with the Ethereum Foundation, the Ethereum Foundation bickered with community members, and community members bickered with each other... Many great people were involved in the project, and their egos often took precedence over the common good.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The book left me with the impression that chaos was inherent in the crypto world. No project, even the most popular and best built, escapes it. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;2-Charles Hoskinson, founder of Cardano, is a liar&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I am absolutely sorry, and this is not a judgment on Cardano&amp;amp;#39;s blockchain, but there is no longer any doubt in my mind that Charles Hoskinson is a liar who has taken advantage of his proximity to Vitalik Buterin to build a reputation. He self-proclaimed himself &amp;amp;quot;CEO&amp;amp;quot; of Ethereum, an absurd title, and then spent his days talking about Lamborghinis while smoking cigars while the real developers did all the work. He also made it look like he was a PhD candidate, which is not true: he never got past the undergrad stage. Even worse: when confronted with the evidence by Laura Shin, he refused to admit the truth and continued to lie, Do Kwon style.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;3-Money makes everyone lose their mind... except Vitalik&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Initially, despite the bickering, there was generally a good-natured atmosphere in the Ethereum developer community. But when the price of ether started to rise, people started to show their true colors. The DAO hack is a perfect example: the person who executed this attack would have been a hero in the community if he or she had chosen the path of honesty, and he or she would have been rewarded; but the amount of money at stake - in the hundreds of millions of dollars - made him or her lose his or her mind, and the person tried to keep it all to himself or herself. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Conversely, there is Vitalik Buterin, whose personal fortune is valued in the hundreds of millions of dollars, but who couldn&amp;amp;#39;t care less. Imagine what Ethereum would look like if a narcissistic megalomaniac had been at its helm... &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;4-The nerds always win&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Several times in the early years of Ethereum, the project could have gone very wrong. Multiple &amp;amp;quot;DOS&amp;amp;quot; attacks were launched, financiers wanted to &amp;amp;quot;sell&amp;amp;quot; Ethereum to private companies, jealous developers wanted to convince regulatory authorities that Ethereum was a bad project...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But at the end of the day, the nerds won. Why did they win? Because they are the only ones who truly understand the full potential of blockchain technology. So they put their heart and soul into it, often at the expense of their personal lives. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Never bet against the nerds; in an increasingly digital world, they will always win.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;5-Nobody knows what the future will bring&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We are all convinced on this sub that crypto will play an important role in the economy of the future. But one thing I took away from my reading is that no one knows what the technology will be used for.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Vitalik Buterin, for example, never saw non-fungible tokens coming; at least, certainly not that they would be used to sell monkey pictures. If even the inventor of Ethereum couldn&amp;amp;#39;t foresee the explosion in popularity of ERC-721, how can we mere mortals claim to know what crypto will look like in five years?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My takeaway is that you always have to keep an open mind if you want to survive in this universe. We are still in the infancy of crypto, no matter what the no-coiners say, and no one knows what the future holds. I find it exciting!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I hope this short summary was helpful, and I wish you all a very green weekly candle!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

It&amp;amp;#39;s not the sure-fire doomsday scenario it was 2 months ago.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;The herd.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When it comes to investing, be careful of following the herd.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Last year, the herd thought Bitcoin was heading to the moon and could hit $100K. And that&amp;amp;#39;s when the herd was overbuying.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Things aren&amp;amp;#39;t looking good. But is the data really showing only doomsday? I&amp;amp;#39;ll explore that in details.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Not every correction is a recession. Not every bear market is long term (see the 2013 mini bear market of 5 months for Bitcoin).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Inflation:&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is the big one. Inflation is still high, but it&amp;amp;#39;s showing signs of slowing down, and potentially having peaked already. If it starts going down, will it still be able to fuel further market fears?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Both CPI and PCE rates have slowed down.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;-CPI slowed from 8.5% in March down to 8.2% in April.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;-PCE has slowed from 6.6% in March down to 6.2% in April.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Obviously real inflation is higher, but these are important for later when we talk about Fed rates.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But what about food and gas still being so expensive? It still costs me so much, how can it have peaked? That brings up the next two points.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Supply chain:&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Probably one of the biggest wrench getting in the way of economic growth in the last 2 years.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Luckily, the supply chain is beginning to reopen, and the bottleneck is getting unclogged. But it has been an uneven recovery.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While you see a lot of items back on the shelves, and shipment taking less time, you have other items like baby formula vanishing from the shelves.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The big one everyone is waiting for is for China to join in that de-clogging. They&amp;amp;#39;re still behind due to their more recent lockdowns.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the US this year:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;47% drop in ship congestion (those ships anchored waiting outside a port).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;12% increase in containers in the main ports (LA, New Jersey, New York, Long beach).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In Europe, they experienced a setback with the war in Ukraine. With some ports getting increases in delays by several hours, sometimes up to two days.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In terms of sea shipping  worldwide, the bottleneck is still high thanks to China and Russia, but we are starting to also see signs that it has peaked:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/6t9zd84c4n291.png?width=990&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=54d4e555c3b0f72dcde6e85bafb82c87ccc0ee31&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/6t9zd84c4n291.png?width=990&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=54d4e555c3b0f72dcde6e85bafb82c87ccc0ee31&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Things are still not looking great and are uneven, but it looks like in many countries we are starting to see things turn around.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Overall, the world waiting time for all cargo ships has dropped. Going from 17 million container waiting days down to 6 million.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Oil: the domino effect that could put the breaks on a recession.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Oil prices has everyone worried.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It has also been a big contributors for rising CPI numbers, and the perceived inflation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It has also been a problem for supply chains, along with businesses. And has put strain on many companies in the stock market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So it&amp;amp;#39;s been in the middle of almost all of our problems.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here&amp;amp;#39;s some good news.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One of the main reason it&amp;amp;#39;s so high, is because OPEC hasn&amp;amp;#39;t increased the output to keep up with the big emerging demand from the post covid crisis, nor make up for the strain from the war in Ukraine.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The purposely held back output to let price rises, to makeup for all the money they lost when oil prices tanked in 2020. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;OPEC is actually due to increase the output in July, per their internal agreement, by 400K barrels per day. So relief will begin this summer.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The G7 meeting has asked them to increase it by even more. So we&amp;amp;#39;ll have to see how big the relief will be.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If oil price output increases significantly, it could bring the price down more significantly, helping everything from inflation to supply chains and businesses.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And it could create a domino effect that could help ignite a potential recovery.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Fed rates:&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Rates don&amp;amp;#39;t have much uncertainty left. Feds have already laid out the roadmap. We know how high they want to go. And unless inflation starts to spiral out of control again, it looks like they are targeting 2-2.5% rates. So only going back to pre-covid rates.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These are still economic stimulation level of rates. They&amp;amp;#39;re not high rates.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now that we got a good idea on how fast they&amp;amp;#39;ll go with the point basis, there&amp;amp;#39;s not much left that hasn&amp;amp;#39;t been priced in already.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The only question is the Fed balance sheet unloading. That&amp;amp;#39;s a little harder to predict the effect. But there won&amp;amp;#39;t be a selling off, they&amp;amp;#39;ll just let bonds expire.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also, keep in mind that legislation has changed a little, with the ability for banks to get their liquidity. So it won&amp;amp;#39;t be quiet the same as it was in the past.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;War in Ukraine:&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I can&amp;amp;#39;t really say too much about this. There&amp;amp;#39;s no clear metrics to talk about here.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This could end next month, or it could end in 5 years.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One thing we do know, is Putin wasn&amp;amp;#39;t able to roll over Ukraine, and move on to the next conquest.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In terms of market uncertainty, it has fizzled out a little bit, and is nowhere near at the level of fear as the early days of the war.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;US GDP:&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is the one place where we can still see an alarming case for a recession.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The GDP has decreased by 1.5%.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That&amp;amp;#39;s as bad as it can get.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But a big part of that decrease was actually caused by the trade deficit, rather than a decrease in spending. Consumer spending actually increased by 2.7%. Inflation adjusted, it still increased by 0.7%.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also, supply chain issues, and slower inventory accumulation fueled that decrease. The effect of high inflation also didn&amp;amp;#39;t help.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But if those problems have already reached their peak, ports are now getting unclogged, and with the trade deficit already going back down, we can have better expectations for much better GDP numbers next quarter.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Can we still have a recession?&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Both in crypto and other markets.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While things may look like they have reached their peak, and there are some improvements already, you never know when there could be set backs.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So I&amp;amp;#39;m definitely not trying to be Nostradamus here. I&amp;amp;#39;m just saying a recession is not 100% in the cards. In fact, it may be starting to diminish in probabilities.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is definitely not your 2008 recession. We still have low unemployment, a strong housing market, trade deficit dropping 15.9%, growing consumer spending, and we don&amp;amp;#39;t have foreclosures popping up everywhere.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bankruptcies filling have also been dropping in the US:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/2ue7dlkj4n291.png?width=782&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=dcbc5af846604e4b395b270d7aacdf7f80cdba1b&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/2ue7dlkj4n291.png?width=782&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=dcbc5af846604e4b395b270d7aacdf7f80cdba1b&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What&amp;amp;#39;s important is to understand the cause of all this, to understand if we are heading straight into a recession.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;The cause.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Where did it all go wrong, and how did we get here in both crypto and other markets?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Long story short: liquidity supply crunch.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Both crypto and stocks have been getting extra fuel with the extra liquidity being printed into the market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Both went a little too high too fast, and got a little overbought.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It was natural that we&amp;amp;#39;d get a correction once the Fed turned off that printer.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So this isn&amp;amp;#39;t exactly a crash where you have foreclosures popping up all over neighborhoods, bankruptcies, and financial institutions collapsing, like in 2008.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is more the market correcting to adjust back to normal pre-covid liquidity.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In fact, for crypto, it may not even be like 2018, and be more like 2013.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Where we got a mini bear market for 5 months in the middle of a bull cycle:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/flk4i3235n291.jpg?width=1262&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=3d96d3ac5785cd6cd0b9443eb4d6abd73270e1a0&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/flk4i3235n291.jpg?width=1262&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=3d96d3ac5785cd6cd0b9443eb4d6abd73270e1a0&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;tl;dr:&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All the same macos that were supporting the theory that we were heading into a long recession, are now showing signs of either peaking, slowing down, or even turning around.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And if a couple of key macros like GDP, supply chain, or oil have a significant turnaround, it could create a domino effect that could fuel a recovery. Or at the very least erase a lot of the fuel behind the recession.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And all 3 are showing data that they are likely to turn around in the coming months.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This doesn&amp;amp;#39;t mean it will necessarily happen, or that we won&amp;amp;#39;t have a long recession. There&amp;amp;#39;s still a strong possibility. Just not as strong as many people think, and definitely not close to 100%. And the likelihood has begun to decrease.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

He said, he had &amp;amp;quot;a model that predicts the last 2 BTC bottom prices&amp;amp;quot; and based on this model, predicted what the next bottom price will be. In the comments, he showed a lot of confidence in his complex model, because &amp;amp;quot;There is a reasoning behind&amp;amp;quot; it and &amp;amp;quot;It&amp;amp;#39;s gonna happen&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Okay, so I thought even though two data points is not really great (to be very euphemistic) and using data from those two data points to predict the same data points is, uh, not best practice, I&amp;amp;#39;m curious what sort of factors they included in their model to get to their estimate. Had to be somewhat complex for them to be so convinced, right?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yeah, no. After eyeballing the &amp;amp;quot;data&amp;amp;quot;, I immediately saw that the BTC &amp;amp;quot;model&amp;amp;quot; was:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;2013 bull run: bottom was roughly ATH divided by 6.5&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;2017 bull run: bottom was roughly ATH divided by 6&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;prediction: so this time it will be ATH divided by 5.5&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Seriously, that&amp;amp;#39;s the whole &amp;amp;quot;model&amp;amp;quot;. His ETH model was even more complex: it&amp;amp;#39;s only based on a single data point but hey, that&amp;amp;#39;s more than zero I guess? There their prediction, which is calculated &amp;amp;quot;applying a corrective factor (eth volatility)&amp;amp;quot; is even more complex: &amp;amp;quot;ETH bottom is always previous ATH divided by 12&amp;amp;quot;. That&amp;amp;#39;s maths for you!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Someone else said in the comments &amp;amp;quot;If you want to see some real math possibilities, then check out the BTC/ETH rainbow charts.&amp;amp;quot; - Jesus, people! It was literally created &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ercwl/status/1341061789182791683&quot;&amp;gt;as a joke&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, there&amp;amp;#39;s no maths behind it and no, it doesn&amp;amp;#39;t work!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Why am I making this post? Because if you&amp;amp;#39;re new-ish to crypto (or just a bit naive) and are seeing a post like that, you might think that those people probably know more than you if they make those predictions, and you might think &amp;amp;quot;even if they are not precise, how can those data-driven predictions be far off?&amp;amp;quot;. The truth is pretty easy, however: &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;predictions like that are complete garbage&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. Not every prediction is on the level of &amp;amp;quot;complete this series of numbers&amp;amp;quot; like the one above, that could be an assignment for like a fourth grader, some include more numbers and complex model specifications. But they&amp;amp;#39;re still complete nonsense. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We simply don&amp;amp;#39;t know what will happen - maybe the economy will crash, maybe it will boom, maybe another LUNA-like fiasco will happen. Those things affect how BTC and ETH will behave. You can build a model that perfectly predicts previous ATHs or ATLs or whatever - honestly, it&amp;amp;#39;s very, very easy - and it doesn&amp;amp;#39;t help you even a bit predicting the future.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Long story short: all &amp;amp;quot;technical analysis&amp;amp;quot; is complete nonsense and you shouldn&amp;amp;#39;t fall for it - no matter if it&amp;amp;#39;s done by someone on the level of a 10-year old like the OP I am quoting or something more complex.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
