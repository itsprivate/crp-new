It will be this kind of disbelief that signals to me we are somewhere near the bottom. I’m still seeing waaay too many positive comments and naive posts with some variation of “BTC is about to snap back!”, “This moving average suggests all the world’s problems are over”, “if you haven’t bought in, you missed your chance at discount crypto!!”. Pfffft. We are NOWHERE near the bottom. It’s going to look like a cold winter’s night, the trees will look dead, snow will cover the entire expanse and there will be a fear that it will be impossible for Bitcoin to ever reach the highs it once had. Until then, buckle up, this failed “inflation hedge” idea isn’t hedging anybody from shit. I’m looking at next year and 2024 as the new bloom. Now we are in the entertainment phase, watching shitcoins and scammy exchanges get rekt, because all they were selling were hopes and dreams.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The relative strength index (RSI) is a momentum indicator used in technical analysis that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions in the price of a stock or other asset. An asset is usually considered overbought when the RSI is above 70% and oversold when it is below 30%.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The RSI will rise as the number and size of positive closes increase, and it will fall as the number and size of losses increase. The second part of the calculation smooths the result, so the RSI will only near 100 or 0 in a strongly trending market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Going on the Weekly charts only, as this is a very long term outlook. Not even the Daily provides this broad of a perspective.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/7fibhwd15i591.png?width=1443&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=ce1699b5f5d0fe1d4545cf78942f03b722ba05d0&quot;&amp;gt;BTC Weekly&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In 2011, just two years after the birth of Bitcoin, the weekly RSI was at 21. The price of bitcoin was $2.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In January 2015, it hit 27. Price was $154.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In December 2019, it hit 29. Price was $3150.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These levels are all textbook oversold values. In the past, every single time it hit these condition levels, it went back to 50 points over the next ~6 months, and hovered around that price for most of that time. After that, it has never again returned to those prices.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Right now, it is at 26, and this is the most oversold it has been in 11 years. I am buying for the next six months. Merry Christmas.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Could it be them just sending their lender more collateral?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I don&amp;amp;#39;t know how that&amp;amp;#39;s handled, but it&amp;amp;#39;s getting close to the level where they are supposed to post more collateral...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In other news...Michael Saylor posted this on twitter, “MicroStrategy has a $205M term loan and needs to maintain $410M as collateral. MSTR has 115,109 BTC that it can pledge. If the price of BTC falls below $3,562 the company could post some other collateral”.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Panic sells off the back of 10% market drops seem like yesterday.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Memories of maximizing apps followed by panic shrieking hair tugging still as clear as day.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Middle of the night portfolio checking, trawling the web for hint&amp;amp;#39;s of good news and sympathizing with fellow redditors losing their shirts.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Months pass... then you realize that somewhere along the way you it appears you have developed a military grade calmness in the face of  obliteration.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A flippant fearlessness that sees the folio figures updating to highlight a 20% loss... closely followed by thoughts of &amp;amp;quot; I wonder whats for dinner&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Browsing net, mainstream media outlets running stories proclaiming another nail in the crypto coffin...closely followed by... shit, better let the dog out for a crap.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Somewhere along your epic crypto journey it seems you&amp;amp;#39;ve developed a superhuman anti-fud kill switch, enabling you to desensitize you&amp;amp;#39;re inner fears in an instant.     &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;No longer are you just calm... you&amp;amp;#39;re crypto calm and frankly with a long-term goal in mind... just couldn&amp;amp;#39;t give a fuck.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Even people who used to be bullish.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/dd587er72i591.jpg?width=360&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=5222a022b79e765365f90c1d0da53e85be4a27f8&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/dd587er72i591.jpg?width=360&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=5222a022b79e765365f90c1d0da53e85be4a27f8&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The confidence in the market and in the price holding up has faltered. And now it&amp;amp;#39;s no longer &amp;amp;quot;we&amp;amp;#39;ll probably crab at $30K&amp;amp;quot; or &amp;amp;quot;$28K still has good support&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That has changed to &amp;amp;quot;I&amp;amp;#39;m just waiting for the drop below $20K&amp;amp;quot; or &amp;amp;quot;it might even dip below $10K&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And how many times has the suicide hotline been posted now? I almost know the number by heart now.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/6rj1tagtuf591.jpg?width=1896&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=9361989a2d19f3d6eb29a176e46e84079dfd1b81&quot;&amp;gt;Here&amp;amp;#39;s what the last capitulation looked like.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I remember when we dropped below $4k in 2018.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While it&amp;amp;#39;s beginning to smell a lot like the same capitulation, this doesn&amp;amp;#39;t mean it&amp;amp;#39;s the full bottom yet.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It was reeking capitulation when we dropped below $4K, and we still continued all the way to $3.2K. But at the same time, the drop was fueled by a Bitcoin selloff from the Hash war.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We aren&amp;amp;#39;t fueled by any huge sell-off from a Hash war this time. But there is the fuel from inflation fears, and a little of CEL fear added to that.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And a better log chart, shows that if we follow 2018, we probably still have a tiny bit more bottom to make.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/knv7almjvf591.jpg?width=1380&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=27088843452ab3137959f8c24ec8bac2aabe8253&quot;&amp;gt;Log chart comparison of capitulations, with moving average ribbon.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When we capitulated in 2018, it seemed like the drop was never gonna end. Any optimism was gone. Even when we dropped below $3.5K, people were talking about &amp;amp;quot;it will probably go lower than $3K&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Even bulls were saying that.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In fact the difference between bulls and bears, is bulls believed it would drop to only $2K, while bears believed it would drop to $200.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Today, it&amp;amp;#39;s starting to look like we have 2 camps: the bulls who believe the bottom will be somewhere below $20K...maybe around $15k. And the bears who believe it will go even lower than $10K.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But let&amp;amp;#39;s not forget about one important thing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The market movers, the whales, big players, with their quants and bots, are still playing the market, and they are still interested in making money. And just like after every major crash we&amp;amp;#39;ve had in the past, there is a period of accumulation. Because people never run out of desire to make money, especially not in this crazy and volatile market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Volatility and chaotic markets offer the biggest opportunity to make money. And right now, this one is deep in fear and with lots of blood on the street.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And perhaps, like the stock market, everyone is holding their breath right now for one little thing: whether this week, Jerome Powell will talk about .50 or .75 basis points.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That could be the difference in how bloody the rest of June will be. And if crypto will go much lower or not.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Instead I&amp;amp;#39;ll ask, how many of y&amp;amp;#39;all are still DCAing? I actually paused mine on Friday because of Gemini stopping free withdrawals, which turned out to be a bit of a lucky break because of this weekend crash, but I might start back up again at the end of this week on a different platform.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At this point in time, though, people would probably be better off keeping an eye on global equities news rather than crypto news. This thing won&amp;amp;#39;t get any better until the macro stuff is sorted out.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;EDIT:In other news, Bitcoin dominance actually fell today, which is surprising. But Bitcoin + stablecoin dominance went UP. Maybe this crypto winter is the one where BTC.D stays below 60% because people are keeping their money into USDC and DAI instead.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In that sense it would truly be a once in a lifetime to get many alts like Eth, Monero and perhaps even super cheap Btc. Since Btc has pretty much taken a Olympic swimming pool sized dump and the market along with it, thought I&amp;amp;#39;d try to speculate a bit positively, well sorta.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;2- I bought HBAR last year at .40 as one youtuber said it would explode and reach $100 EOY 2021. I secretly thought even if it goes $10, I will be sweet. I am sour like he&amp;amp;#39;ll right now. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

This too shall pass.
I told myself the same when we reached 50k last year and started saving for the rainy days.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The only question is ... Is your bag full of solid tokens that can stand the test of time like Bitcoin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you look at all the charts for past bull runs followed by the bear market you&amp;amp;#39;ll see the coin shoot up 10-20-100x in a matter of months. This is in fact manipulation and not &amp;amp;quot;retail fomoing in&amp;amp;quot;. Then it slowly bleeds for 3-4 years. The reason for this is so that when whales want to sell off they will have plenty of liquidity for their price target, say about 30%-50% of that ATH. They need retail to buy their bags that they slowly sell off, while retail says &amp;amp;quot;buy the dip, omg 50% off, you begged for these prices, etc...&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This false idea that retail is getting a good deal psychological hurts them since they will keep buying&amp;amp;quot;high&amp;amp;quot; which just leads to more losses. But then the price will drop more leading them to question how can this coin drop another 50% from where i bought, it already dropped 75%, something must be wrong with this coin, I should sell, which further drops the price and affects those other dip buyers. However, they failed to look at the price of the coin 2 years ago which was probably $0.005 and now they are buying at $0.10 from a top of $0.80 but they think this is a good deal, when in fact the coin will bottom at like $0.02. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Right now the sentiment is, keep buying, this is a steal, you&amp;amp;#39;ll be so happy you bought now, but the most likely outcome is coins are now still in the zone for whales to keep dumping. They need you BUYING for liquidity and then after that it&amp;amp;#39;s just gonna stay flat, then people will lose interest and it will keep dropping. You have to remember us shrimp barely affect these $B mcap coins, whales run the show, and now they are cashing out on us. They are not buying, they are selling.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In a price perspective to evaluate a good deal, look at the price of the coin a couple years ago to its low, then its new ATH and see where is can sorta fall in the middle. For example ETH bottomed at ~$90 during the covid crash, then topped at $~5k. So right now people are saying $1400 is a great deal. Well $1400 is still very high from that last bottom but not that far down from the top. So a good deal relative to all prices is around $500-$700.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So remember look at both the coins ATH &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;and&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; its previous low to figure out if its a good buying opportunity. If you look at just the ATH its most likely a manipulated ATH price and the discount you&amp;amp;#39;re seeing is an illusion.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;FUD means &amp;amp;quot;Fear, Uncertainity and Doubt&amp;amp;quot; and not &amp;amp;quot;blatant lies&amp;amp;quot;. If the doubts are legit you should definitely reconsider your investment. The LUNA debacle speaks for itself and only one months later we have Celsius Network suspending withdrawals after appearantly sending hundreds of millions of funds to FTX. Both of those outcomes have been predicted by many and have been brushed off as FUD.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Stop creating echochambers, it hurts everyone and most importantly, it makes the cryptospace look like a goddamn cult.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
