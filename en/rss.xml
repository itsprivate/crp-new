&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;IF (you open source your most precious code       &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Seems like a fair take to balance out all the other hot takes from web2 founders and devs who are on a public rampage against web3 products, probably because they see their products and services lose customers quickly to web3 based products and services, as people catch on to the decentralised web.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Just trying to take a straw poll. Personally I’m feeling positive but that’s why I’m asking… my optimism has tripped me up before!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On a separate note I’ve been considering the best way to prepare for these dips and corrections and I’m wondering about consolidating coins into one or two safer projects that aren’t as heavily affected when I see a 5-10% dip over say 1-2 days. In the past that would have been BTC but I’m not convinced it’s the right move now given how the dips seem to be affecting it’s price to similar degree when compared to well established alts. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I have been hesitant ever since it was signaled that there would be an announcement from the White House on how they wanted to “enforce rules around crypto as a matter of national security”. I’m sure this announcement will be something close to what India has done with their 30% but there is no way to know.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

So, the question is what Airdrops are for?
Build fake hype
Sell useless/fake crypto, nft or whatever
Accumulate KYC data for future projecs or just to sell them
Rug pull
Pump and dump
Ect...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s better to stay away from all of them, than to send your credentials to every one.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Stay safe&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit : Cosmos and ATOM are the 1% of great airdrops. And please don&amp;amp;#39;t count the old ones during good times, I&amp;amp;#39;m talking about nowadays.. Stop it with BTC faucet, ETH airdrops or Uni swap airdrops years ago.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

And today, one of Canada&amp;amp;#39;s largest auditing and verification firms announced that they have purchased BTC and ETH for the first time ever!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The firm, KPMG, is a major player in Canada. It&amp;amp;#39;s been around for more than 150 years and employs nearly 8,000 people. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here&amp;amp;#39;s what they had to say : &amp;amp;quot;Investors such as hedge funds and family offices to large insurers and pension funds &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;are increasingly gaining exposure to cryptoassets&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; (...). This investment reflects our belief that &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;institutional adoption of cryptoassets and blockchain technology will continue to grow&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; and become a regular part of the asset mix.&amp;amp;quot; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For me, this news is absolutely a bullish sign. No matter what the haters and no-coiners think, crypto is here to stay, and this kind of news proves it. Institutions have only just set foot in it: we are still very early! Just think about it : if you hold long enough, you will probably end up selling your tokens to Wall Street big boys in a few years. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We are, indeed, all gonna make it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When put to scientific tests it doesn&amp;amp;#39;t hold up against empirical evidence. Analysts consistently looking at different indicators and hedge their analysis. Often going BACK to data and drawing lines saying LOOK LOOK it broke the barrier line trend hill thing! SEE!           &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Listen - if this stuff actually worked - we would have giant AI computers dedicated to learning how to do it - oh that&amp;amp;#39;s right we do - and you know what happens when we plug them in to the system? The system figures it out and reacts differently. The global mood changes on a dime and all TA goes out the door with it.         &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;tldr; IT IS NOT OBJECTIVE.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;         &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Let me be clear, there ARE definite patterns within the stock market, and if they are recognized they can be successfully traded upon, but analyst cannot separate themselves from their beliefs and pre-dispositions, they selectively, and possibly sub-consciously, choose charts and TA indicators that confirm what they have already concluded.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I mean it&amp;amp;#39;s right to some extent that crypto is using electricity that is unsustainable for mining. With that dancing the environment. But those people are onto some other stuff. Many thinking that all 5k cryptos use mining that is 100% unsustainable.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So let&amp;amp;#39;s be clear very few cryptos nowadays use pow and even then the energy for mining is getting more and more sustainable. At least already more than their beloved banks.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Seeing so many people uneducated about crypto but spreading hate shows how much growing room we still have left.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Bitcoin is the answer and the only asset I can trust to hold it for decades. Other than corporations. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What do you think should I do? Should I try to time the market if let‘s say the market turns really risky and euphoric by 2023 or shall I hodl and nevermind?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I love the diamondhand and never sell movement, but I also don‘t wanna live like a wageslave just to stack sats until I die lol. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Btw I live in Europe so studying cost are basically almost zero.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Posting this for several years!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Around the same amount that last week. We are looking for around 110 BTC monthly. Way lower that years ago.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Reason? New exchanges, where Binance is king, &amp;amp;quot;the&amp;amp;quot; P2P (with all the risk involved) option to go, not only BTC but other crypto and stablecoins. Easiest way of purchase BTC with devaluated Bolivares (Bs.)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sadly, Binance doesn&amp;amp;#39;t offer the stats of the amound traded. But it is safe to assume Binance (And other exchanges like Reserve and AirTM) has absorbed all the amount that LocalBitcoin used to trade.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Monthly minimum wage is 2 USD that is for public workers and they receive some kind of incentives (a monthly box of food that is around 20 USD), you cannot live with that.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;If that is you only income, you died years ago starving or your family is helping inside Venezuela or from abroad or you have another job or you left the country (even walking).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Average monthly wage is around 90 USD (Monthly). A Manager is around 210 USD (monthly). &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://talcualdigital-com.translate.goog/ovf-salario-promedio-del-sector-comercio-subio-un-71-a-892-durante-2021/?_x_tr_sl=es&amp;amp;amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;amp;amp;_x_tr_hl=en-US&amp;amp;amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp&quot;&amp;gt;https://talcualdigital-com.translate.goog/ovf-salario-promedio-del-sector-comercio-subio-un-71-a-892-durante-2021/?_x_tr_sl=es&amp;amp;amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;amp;amp;_x_tr_hl=en-US&amp;amp;amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Some NGO say around 500 USD monthly are needed for a 5 members family to &amp;amp;quot;live&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;There are in fact so many places (department stores, big ones like Traki, Biomercados) where you can pay directly with crypto. People always use stablecoins like &amp;amp;quot;USDT&amp;amp;quot; (what a fear), USDC, BUSD, AirUSD and so on.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;2021 inflation was around 700%.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If they had hold onto it, most of them has been recovered. It is just a matter of time when their investment doesn&amp;amp;#39;t just recover, but will turn into big profit.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We invest in crypto, keyword : &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Invest&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you are in cryptoverse, just for the gamble by buying shitcoins, you can go to the casino instead...this isnt called investing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But if you invest, you had did DYOR and diversify your portfolio.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Time will tell, the true diamond hands will be the ones taking the best profit.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the stock market for example buying ETFs, you need at least to invest in a timeframe of 15 years to get some halfway decent gains.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Their portfolio contains 18 coins as of  now:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Larger market cap ($5B plus): LUNA, MATIC, NEAR, UNI&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Average market cap ($1B plus): GRT, FLOW, AR, CELO&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Small market cap (less than $1B): AUDIO, RLY, UMA, KEEP, RSR, DODO, RARI&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Okay, enough introduction. Let&amp;amp;#39;s see how these coins perform in the last 1 year, from Jan 2021 to date.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;1. Overall performance - ROI 1168%; 15/18 up; 3/18 down&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/axvjaey6c4g81.png?width=925&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=6508771f2076b077e3585e1bbb7ee17cec4cddc5&quot;&amp;gt;Coinbase Venture&amp;amp;#39; portfolio&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Even when the market is still down right now, the return is 1,168%. This is a great return compared to various asset classes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/ujjxpreqc4g81.png?width=463&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=48e6e9b5fb65cd81cdd5efe5c04db7c1b7abe52a&quot;&amp;gt;Comparison to other asset classes&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Except oil, which has a relatively fine return of 93%, the rest isn&amp;amp;#39;t that impressive. And Mr Pete, I&amp;amp;#39;m looking at you. Gold price actually decreased by 7% in the last year.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;2. The top gainers and which are the threes that make losses?&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The top 5 gainers in this portfolio is MATIC, LUNA, AR, NEAR and AUDIO. The most impressive ones are MATIC and LUNA which had returned over 8000%.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/brsh46l4d4g81.png?width=447&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=7e28276133d7844c27b79c70affee776b0088009&quot;&amp;gt;Top gainers and 3 losers&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The losses are actually not that huge, however. It&amp;amp;#39;s quite normal for small cap coins to lose over 90% value in a market downturn. I&amp;amp;#39;d say COMP will go back up pretty quickly once the market improves.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;3. Show me the sectors - which market niches do CV invested in and how do they perform&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now I sort the portfolio based on the sector. You could see BTC stands as a category, even though it&amp;amp;#39;s labelled as &amp;amp;quot;Currencies&amp;amp;quot; as it is the OG cryptocurrency, but nowadays it&amp;amp;#39;s more like a store value of money. BTC is also the staple in the many institutional investor&amp;amp;#39;s holdings.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/0foje1azd4g81.png?width=825&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=84ecbae33684c4167b940c6ff5cb13786ebe4f99&quot;&amp;gt;By sector&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;CV invested quite heavily in smart contract platforms, which features ETH, LUNA, NEAR, FLOW and CELO. I&amp;amp;#39;d also argue that MATIC is closely related, though it&amp;amp;#39;s not a L1, but with the high gas fees of Ethereum, MATIC as the front runner of scalability will be needed for a foreseeable future. All of this category did well, most notably LUNA and MATIC. NEAR also has a good run lately, though it&amp;amp;#39;s not often mentioned in this sub.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m quite surprised that CV didn&amp;amp;#39;t invest in ATOM and DOT, the two front runners of interoperability. However, they did invest in a small cap on this, which is KEEP Network. So far it has doubled in value but probably needs more time to prove its worth.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;DeFi is a little disappointed at the moment, but many has predicted DeFi will see its rise in 2022. CV invested in only 1 lending defi which is COMP.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Other niche markets had been seeing mix results:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Asset management (RSR): down at the moment, but this is also quite new.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Content distribution: AUDIO - which has returns quite nicely as it&amp;amp;#39;s the front runner in music streaming.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Data management (The Graph): doing ok at the moment. It might have the time with Web3.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Exchanges (UNI and DODO): UNI has its time in 2021 like most others, DODO has been in trouble with the hack last year.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;File storage (AR): recently has partnered with Solana. AR is up over 1400% in the last year.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Tokenization (RLY and RARI): above average returns. Social tokens RLY and RARI is for buy/sell NFTs.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;How&amp;amp;#39;s your portfolio doing? Are you happy with your choice of coins? Are you planning to buy or sell anything new? Let me know in the comment.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;*EDIT\&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;*&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I just do another deep dive into the list. Messari list doesn&amp;amp;#39;t list all the coins that Coinbase Venture had invested in.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/is9lcabjr5g81.png?width=838&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=576bf2479bae2ad14f36fd1dd2a145b99fd250e8&quot;&amp;gt;Here is another updated version from Coinbase Venture website&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;CV seems to focus more on the new trend now. One focus I could find is that now they stress on the important of NFT utility phase - so think beyond a picture of a rock that is sold for $1.3M&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/jwawkprtr5g81.png?width=833&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=afa00b8546378b047dfaddf2996313c646bd7195&quot;&amp;gt;Info from Coinbase blog&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For platform and developer tools, the focus is now shifted to Web3, with the tool kits that help the developers to make things happen. Also they pay attention to API such as Alchemy.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/nhx2c898s5g81.png?width=880&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=34195984e01d7fb927dc502569da11d537575c56&quot;&amp;gt;Info from Coinbase blog&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For more info please visit the Coinbase Ventures website. They have a full list of investments. When I have time I can actually look further into which coins do they invested in.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;**EDIT 2*\&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;*&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I could actually find another list of coins that Coinbase Venture had invested in. There are currently 38 coins (under &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Coinbase Ventures Portfolio Screener&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;). &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/g7k72evpq6g81.png?width=1919&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=8d942a57050fc809ddbd745cc84e1e47a01fed72&quot;&amp;gt;Coinbase Venture 38 coins - Portfolio Screener&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This list doesn&amp;amp;#39;t contain BTC or ETH but we all know they own a truckload of BTC and ETH already. Some other interesting picks:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Metaverse / Gaming - SAND - arguably one of the better games in the Metaverse now (stand out against a sea of garbage games)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Smart contracts - MINA, CTK&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Shared compute - LPT: which is kind of similar to THETA, focus on video infrastructure. It did have a pump in Nov 2021 (note not all alts have pumped crazily in Nov 2021)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Derivatives - SNX for Defi application. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

This is not the only similarity - back then BTC pumped from 35k to 39k within 14 hours, while yesterday we saw a pump from 37k to 41k in 9 hours.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This uptrend was short lived and BTC was above 40k for just 2 days, to crash even lower than previously in the next week.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is also worth noting that we are far from &amp;amp;quot;invalidating weeks of FUD&amp;amp;quot; (as one of the top post claims, the one about a potential short squeeze), because we are basically at the support level from just 2 weeks ago - after going below 45k in January, BTC was testing the 40k-41k support for a while, just to crash below it on 20th of January. This was just sixteen days ago!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The only positive aspect about current situation is that you can kind-of see a slight uptrend since hitting 33k on 24th of January when you zoom out, but this means as much as the current alignment of stars on the night sky.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Whether we go &amp;amp;quot;up only&amp;amp;quot; or continue the downtrend remains to be seen. Personally my bets are 50% on going up and 50% on going down, so as you see I have a pretty strong opinion about the current state of the market (;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Nearly always with the same amount, few exceptions when I got a bonus from work etc. Basically, I wanted to go all-in but didn&amp;amp;#39;t have any savings, so decided to buy with max amount that I can, every month from the salary. I kinda had the idea of stacking my way to a million dollars (or euros), however long it would take. Because the way I see Bitcoin, I have no doubt it&amp;amp;#39;s gonna happen. Sooner if I stack more, and later if stack less.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I saw stacking sats become a meme and people posting screenshots on Twitter. But I felt like the bigger picture was missing. How much can you achieve by simply stacking sats all the time? This is my idea of a blueprint. I stack with certain amount and have been doing it for a certain while. You can take a look at the progress and get and idea how it would work for you.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In short, its gonna take time. And its gonna require patience and nerves. Bitcoin is gonna test you, and there&amp;amp;#39;s no shortcuts to success. My advice: start stacking, keep stacking! Promise yourself to stack at least 4 years before you even think about giving up. I document my journey here in the blog. Enjoy reading and I hope you have great success stacking sats!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
