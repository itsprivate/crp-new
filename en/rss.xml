Biometrics and facial recognition in VR headsets or AR glasses will be used to authenticate users to a specific wallet address, guaranteeing that no user votes twice. This will lead to an informal global democracy. Ignoring or acting against the will of global consensus will be considered political taboo in many countries. Over time, this voting mechanism will fundamentally transform the way in which humanity governs itself.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thank you for reading my silly prediction. Obligatory, this is not financial advice but entertainment only. Proof of my last prediction is noted in the subreddit&amp;amp;#39;s wiki under the crypto history section.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

That’s just for the wedding. With the divorce rate steadily increasing, a marriage is the most risky, unfavorable investment one could make in his/her entire life. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then, let’s say you and your significant other decides to divorce. Attorney fees, and divorce filings can well exceed $10k (If you’re lucky) and that’s not even taking into account your significant other taking half of your shit + child support if you have children. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Society is programmed into thinking getting married and having children is happiness. Don’t get me wrong, of course there’s happiness and love involved, but almost 65% of men and women find out the hard way there is A LOT of financial suffering involved too. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In conclusion, investing in Crypto is a risk, but so is living the blueprint model of happiness and success. Investing in crypto seems a lot safer than getting married to one person for the rest of your life. I’m just saying.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Okay, this sound somewhat unbelievable, but there&amp;amp;#39;s more to the story.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They report, he is giving back to the community and &amp;amp;quot;A cryptocurrency he set up to support charity has already seen more than £200,000 spent on causes, and he is looking to use further funds raised by his currency to realise his foodbank plans for his home town of Birmingham.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The problem is: that token shut down in October, as a &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jimwaterson/status/1491361991541538817&quot;&amp;gt;Twitter user&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; found out through a short search. If you look at their &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://np.reddit.com/r/Orfano/&quot;&amp;gt;subreddit&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; it&amp;amp;#39;s dead and people don&amp;amp;#39;t seem very happy - it seemingly was a scam.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What the fuck? I know crypto reporting in mainstream media is often bad, and crypto media is always awful, but how can such a big medium publish such a story without the most basic research?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The coins were never put into my portfolio.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I opened a support ticket, and got a vague non-answer by reply (we&amp;amp;#39;re looking into it). It was promptly closed without explanation. I have since opened another 3 tickets which have all been met with similar vague responses, and then the tickets are closed without explanation. My requests to make a complaint have been ignored. I posted on their subreddit 2 weeks ago and got another vague response, no DMs etc.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;ve posted there again today but don&amp;amp;#39;t expect much.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My account is not suspended etc., I am still able to transact with existing funds and deposit fiat. I tested this yesterday.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The funny thing is I trade high volume and had I continued using CBP, I would have paid them multiples of the value of this deposit in fees over the next 12 months. Congrats, you played yourselves.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I was able to live with CBP constantly going down during periods of volatility (sus AF!) but this is crossing the line.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;I am purely posting to encourage others to stay away from coinbase and CBP.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; I am not the first person this has happened to. There are literally hundreds of posts like mine on their support sub where people have had funds vanish and the support team just ignores them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Aside from this their fee structure sucks anyway. People seem think CBP is the cheapest for fees but they&amp;amp;#39;re only the cheapest if you trade over $100k per month. I only used them because it was a quick cash onramp from my Revolut account. I&amp;amp;#39;ll be sticking with Binance and Kraken from here on out.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Be careful where you leave your funds.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;EDIT: Lots of people doubting the legitimacy of my post which I guess is healthy skepticism. When I get home from work I will redact my personal details and edit in links to my (very one sided) correspondence with Coinbase.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;From this newspaper that is nationally distributed in Russia: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/5206307&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/5206307&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The government and the Bank of Russia have agreed on a future regime for the circulation of cryptocurrencies in Russia: before February 18, they will prepare a draft law on the circulation of digital currencies in the Russian Federation, in which cryptocurrencies are recognized as an analogue of currencies, and not digital financial assets (DFA). Their circulation in the legal sector will be possible only with full identification, through the banking system or licensed intermediaries. Operations equivalent to more than 600 thousand rubles must be declared, transactions outside the legal sector for such amounts will become a criminal offense and an aggravating circumstance under the Criminal Code, fines will be introduced for the illegal acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a means of payment. Mining and related issues of DFA are not affected by the concept within which the project is being prepared.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The government, after meetings with Deputy Prime Minister, Chief of Staff of the White House Dmitry Grigorenko, published the approved &amp;amp;quot;Concept for regulating the mechanisms for organizing the circulation of digital currencies.&amp;amp;quot; Recall that the White House has been discussing the new status of cryptocurrencies and digital currencies in the Russian Federation since the summer of 2021, in January 2021 a road map was created on this issue, the Bank of Russia made a consultative report proposing to ban the circulation of cryptocurrencies in the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Finance - with its own development on this topic. The final concept is mainly based on the positions of the Ministry of Finance.Until February 18, the ministry and the Bank of Russia must formulate either a separate bill or amendments to the law on the CFA and other laws for its implementation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The details of the &amp;amp;quot;transition period&amp;amp;quot;, as well as mining, are not discussed by the concept. Meanwhile, they are quite important: the regulation of turnover will require quick decisions from cryptocurrency owners - whether they should move into the emerging legal market segment, get rid of such assets, or stay in the illegal sector. The main difference between the concept, which, in fact, implements the Central Bank&amp;amp;#39;s strong distrust of cryptocurrency, is the proposal to develop amendments to the Criminal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure, according to which evasion of declaring transactions with cryptocurrency will become a criminal offense, and its use will become an aggravating circumstance in other offenses.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The possession of cryptocurrency in the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation and transactions with it (as well as with the dollar) are not prohibited - but only through the &amp;amp;quot;organizer of the digital currency exchange system&amp;amp;quot; (a bank with a universal license) or a p2p exchanger legalized in the Russian Federation. The mode of operation of the legal segment involves the full identification of the client according to banking rules, work taking into account AML / CFT requirements, all information about transactions through the Transparent Blockchain system of Rosfinmonitoring will be available for state control in the same way as transactions with non-cash rubles or foreign currency on bank accounts. The mode of control over transactions with the cryptocurrency of natural persons, however, is described by the concept as not too different from the mode of control over cash transactions with any currency. Most likely, the main argument “for” was that in the USA, the EU and Japan they are inclined to the same or to strict bans, as in China, which was also proposed by the Bank of Russia.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So far, the most intriguing is the organization of the legalization of the existing undeclared cryptocurrency, which is not described in the concept. Market participants have no doubts that the possibilities of working with &amp;amp;quot;legal crypto&amp;amp;quot; in the implementation of the concept are adequate. The same part of the owners who prefer to remain in the sector illegal for the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation depends on the future taxation of operations with cryptocurrencies (from the meaning of the concept it follows that it should not differ from the principles of holding foreign currency) and on the rules of legalization. The Ministry of Finance&amp;amp;#39;s estimate of the total amount of crypto assets in the Russian Federation has not changed - it is 12 million crypto wallets with assets worth 2 trillion rubles. It is decidedly unknown whether this figure takes into account the cryptocurrency used in the criminal sector, obviously.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

This is also more than just a simple nice-to-have feature. Imagine you browse websites that knowingly sell your I.P. address and other information to hackers and other malicious actors can openly see what you&amp;amp;#39;re doing and your physical location on a map. Isn&amp;amp;#39;t that dangerous? Don&amp;amp;#39;t our Anti-virus softwares and web browsers stop us from doing these things? Don&amp;amp;#39;t all windows machines have these installed by default?               &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It feels like this is one of those topics that 5 or 10 years down the road, none of us will be discussing because it&amp;amp;#39;s already been implemented for a long long time. If you guys used the first iterations of the internet where you had to memorize I.P. Addresses because there were no DNS names to get to some places online, then pretty much everyone here would agree that no one would use the internet of the late 80s and early 90s today if it were still the same way.                  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To the people who say, &amp;amp;quot;If you have lots of money in ETH or BTC and you are sending it to an address by mistake, it&amp;amp;#39;s your fuck up and you deserve to lose your money.&amp;amp;quot; You&amp;amp;#39;re missing the point completely. The point is that your antivirus warns you when you are about to make a massive mistake that could lead to something like ransomware, spyware, or trojans getting installed to your PC. I think it would be great to have Metamask fire off an audible warning and a message that says, &amp;amp;quot;The wallet address you are sending funds to is a known contract address and not a hot wallet. The funds you send will not be used by any human being and will be lost forever. Do you wish to continue?&amp;amp;quot; seems fine. Maybe stack it with, something like, &amp;amp;quot;This address is to a known wallet address of an Exchange that suffered a security breach and has ended service to their customers. The funds you send to this wallet address will likely be lost forever.&amp;amp;quot; Not bad...              &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But what if we have someone whose account on an exchange was terminated and then all of the exchanges got together and said, &amp;amp;quot;Let&amp;amp;#39;s make a database of irrecoverable wallet addresses where terminated / irretrievable 0x addresses exist so that users don&amp;amp;#39;t send funds to them by mistake, and let the people at Metamask know this as well.&amp;amp;quot; Sounds like an interesting value proposition.                  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Finally, by improving the way wallets function we are increasing adoption by eliminating one route where users can screw up simply by stopping them from making a mistake and making them double check an address they send funds to.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;                &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;And I almost forgot: To be clear, I am NOT advocating that wallets block transactions at all. If the user is fully aware of what they are doing, then the opus is on them.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sometimes, luck is when opportunity meets preparation. The opportunity of a lifetime has been in front of people for a months if not years now! Many people dismiss crypto because they don’t understand it. Instead of giving an hour of their time to begin learning about the problems that crypto solves.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Stop listening to good ol’ banks. They don’t care about you. Be aware, and have clear frame of mind.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Born too late to explore the Earth. Born too early to explore the stars. But born just in time to invest in Cryptocurrency. Don’t hesitate to take opportunities. It’s your time now !&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;She is a strong believer in disruptive technologies.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Think robotics, tomorrow’s batteries and genomics as well as erm.. blockchain technology and is perhaps &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;the most bullish person&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; on crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;She recently predicted that BTC will be worth &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;over $1M by 2030&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, making her perhaps the most bullish person I know.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Allow me to summarize the report’s highlights on the future of Bitcoin..&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Ark Invest analysts predict that the market capitalization of blockchain technology will reach $49T in 2030.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That’s roughly &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;half&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; what the global equities market is worth today ($106T).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cathie Wood predicts that &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;more than half (57%)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; of that market cap will come from Bitcoin alone; believing Bitcoin’s market cap will climb to &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$28T by 2030.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Currently, Bitcoin&amp;amp;#39;s market cap stands at $815B, down from an ATH of around $1.2T.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And this is where she gets her $1M/BTC price point from (more details on that at the end of this post).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;According to Cathie Wood, El Salvador’s Bitcoin “experiment” is already a resounding success.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Why?&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; The data &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;speaks volumes.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;# of people in El Salvador with a Bitcoin wallet = &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;3.8 million&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;# of people in El Salvador with a traditional bank account = &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;1.9 million&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The % of eligible citizens with a Bitcoin wallet in El Salvador is 84% as of December 2021, versus 42% with a traditional bank account.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;What’s more bullish is people are actually using these wallets!&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Bitcoin wallets in El Salvador settled (on average) &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$2M worth of transactions in remittances DAILY&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; as of October 2021.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;On an annual basis, this accounts for roughly &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;12% of ALL remittances sent&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; to El Salvador (total = $6B annually, or &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;2% of El Salvador’s overall GDP&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Reader’s Note I — Remittances are money transfers sent from one party who works abroad to another in their home country (typically family).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;And El Salvador is not alone..&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;2021 was the year that Bitcoin’s annual settlement volume &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;surpassed that of Visa’s.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitcoin’s total came to a whopping &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$13.1T, or ~120% of Visa’s.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is effectively a &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;5x increase&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; on the previous year ($2.3T in 2020, ~24% of the Visa network’s).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However, is the Bitcoin network becoming more dominated by larger investors with deeper pockets?!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&quot;md-spoiler-text&quot;&amp;gt;Well.. probably.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The average value of each individual transaction in 2021 was $136,555. This is up from $21,590 in 2020, significantly more than the increase in Bitcoin’s price over the same period.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This makes sense as ETFs, countries and companies have all increased their BTC holdings in 2021 and now hold roughly 1.5 million BTC. Or, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;8% of the total circulating supply.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The 5 largest publicly disclosed bitcoin wallets belong to the (1) Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (2) Block One (3) Microstrategy (4) CoinShares and (5) Tesla.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;But what about me, you and the annoying Karen you avoid on the school run?&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Believe it or not, most Bitcoin investors in 2021 were not speculators.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The number of BTC long term holders has been steadily increasing since 2011, except for a substantial “blip” back in 2018. Understandable.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This trend has continued throughout the most recent bull run in 2020/21.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Long term investors now collectively hold &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;13.5m Bitcoin&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, or more than half of all BTC.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Reader’s Note II — A “long term investor” is defined by Ark Invest as someone who has held their BTC for more than 155 days.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Reader’s Note III — Yes, they removed any wallets with “dust” BTC from the data.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;So how does Cathie Wood arrive at the $28T BTC market cap by 2030?&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Is she, like all of us, drunk on hopium?&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I’ll give you the figures and let you make your mind up:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Reader’s Note IV — Important For Context..  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Gold’s market capitalization is $10T (2021)  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The global equities market has an overall market capitalization of $106T (2021)  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In their analysis, Ark Invest chose to project BTC’s 2030 market cap using 2021 data rather than “&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;projected&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;” 2030 data/guesswork.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now For The Juice:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;BTC will become the new “digital gold” and account for a whopping 50% of gold’s market cap by 2030 — or, $5.5T.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;More S&amp;amp;amp;P companies will keep BTC on their balance sheets (like Tesla). Ark Invest estimates 5% of balance sheets will be kept in BTC — adding another $4.2T.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Institutions are not far behind and will keep 2.55% of assets in BTC — accounting for $4.1T.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;High Net Worth Individuals will dedicate 5% of their portfolios to BTC — that’s another $4.0T right there.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Nation-states will keep 1% of their reserves in BTC — providing a further $3.8T in “value” to the market.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;US Banks will get in on the action too and use BTC for 25% of all inter-bank settlements — that’s another $3.8T.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;BTC will have replaced fiat currencies in emerging markets at a rate of around 10% by 2030 — or, $2.8T.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Finally, BTC will account for 50% of all global remittances — adding a relatively meagre $0.3T.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&quot;md-spoiler-text&quot;&amp;gt;Grand Total = $28.5T (equal to $1.36M/BTC)&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Reader’s Note V — For those interested, I personally think some of these numbers are actually conservative especially as (mentioned earlier) they’re based on 2021 market capitalization rather than “projected” 2030 market caps.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Obv there is so much more in the report about blockchain tech and DeFi, but I chose to focus on BTC in this post because I, honestly, already doubt anyone will read this considering its length so it doesn’t need to be any longer.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyway, I’m sorry if I bored you and you’re most welcome if you happened to read and appreciate this post :)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

For &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://crypto.com&quot;&amp;gt;crypto.com&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; most likely Matt Damon is going to appear again.  But did you know that in the last commercial there was a hidden Easter egg, hidden to the side, below is the image&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/j9tdy8pybog81.png?width=686&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=f528560f443709228ff4478efd79ef796e8f732d&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/j9tdy8pybog81.png?width=686&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=f528560f443709228ff4478efd79ef796e8f732d&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;you see that QR code hidden to the side? Well had you scan that code; it would had taken you to a website which you can register and then get a free airdrop.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyways, this super bow, the entire US is going to be watching and I think speculate that buried in those commercials might be some other hidden easter eggs, may be not QR codes but something else.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I don&amp;amp;#39;t think its going to be much even if there are easter eggs but hey free money and the chance to brag that you found it on your own.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Two camps have formed, and there is no indication that they will find common ground anytime soon. I will not take side with this post, as I only want to inform people of this issue.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;So... What exactly is going on?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One of the pillars of the Web3 movement is the Ethereum Naming Service (ENS). This is a way to associate a public address with an easy-to-remember address; rather than telling your friend to send ether to you at 0x1234abcd..., for example, you tell them to send that to &amp;amp;quot;yourname.eth&amp;amp;quot;. It may not matter much today, but this protocol is a part of the foundation on which much of Web3 is built.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One of ENS&amp;amp;#39;s most influential developers, Brantly Millegan, has made some very controversial tweets about homosexuality, trans people, masturbation and pornography. Brantly is a practicing Catholic, and he has stated that all of these things are &amp;amp;quot;evil&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;People in the community asked him to withdraw his words and apologize, which he refused.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Why did the situation escalate?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Soon, two camps were formed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On the one hand, those who believe that Brantly can say whatever he wants, since it is his freedom of speech. These people do not necessarily endorse his positions, but they defend his right to express them. They argue that the essence of Web3 is permissionless. In their view, nobody should be cancelled for their personnal beliefs.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On the other hand, there are those who believe that Brantly views are dangerous and hurtful to members of the community who are gay, transgender, or who use pornography. They are afraid that, as a public figure in the Web3 community, Brantly will scare away a lot of people with his opinions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We have all the ingredients for a good old-fashioned &amp;amp;quot;wokeness versus free speech&amp;amp;quot; conflict.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;What are the consequences of the dispute?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Brantly was removed from his position by the organization that manages ENS. Some of the &amp;amp;quot;free speech&amp;amp;quot; fringe reacted by selling their ENS tokens, and some even gave up their .eth domain entirely.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On its side, the &amp;amp;quot;woke&amp;amp;quot; fringe hopes that such incidents will not happen again. They are gathered under the name &amp;amp;quot;ENS is for everyone&amp;amp;quot;, and they militate for Web3 to be a safe space for everyone.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;What&amp;amp;#39;s next?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I don&amp;amp;#39;t know, and nobody knows. But this first culture war is a great test to determine the values of Web3. Do we want it to be a bastion of free speech, or do we want it to be a welcoming place for everyone? The next few weeks are gonna be interesting, that&amp;amp;#39;s for sure.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thanks for reading, and I hope you learned something from me today! What do you think about all this?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;EDIT : &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Please be respectful in your comments, the discussion will be of better quality that way.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Having taught in schools for nearly 5 years you can get a sense about what is important to kids.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Facebook is not cool&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; = Subsequent rebranding and losing relevance &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Tik tok very cool&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; = tik tok becoming the leading social platform for 12 - 45 yr olds.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;The US Office is better than the UK Office&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; = US office now the only one streaming on Aus Netflix.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I must confess, 5 years ago I didn&amp;amp;#39;t hear any of the above. Facebook was (somehow) cool, tik tok didn&amp;amp;#39;t exist and there was stiff competition for which Office series was better. Fast forward to today..&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m teaching my Yr 9 commerce class and they ask &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;sir which crypto do you recommend buying?&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Students no longer laugh on this topic, even 3 years ago they might have switched off. But not now. they are increasingly involved in crypto and are investing in it themselves. This is because it is both relevant and achievable for them to do so.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m telling you listen to what the youth is talking about; they are INTO crypto and that makes me bullish af.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I own a telegram group where this morning an user entered telling everyone to be quick because today it was starting the private sale of a new coin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I looked at its website and it was clearly made by an amateur. It&amp;amp;#39;s whitepaper was a joke.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However, the devs officially doxxed themselves and most users in their &amp;amp;quot;official&amp;amp;quot; telegram group were starring to believe in this scam.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I noticed some users were clearly fake, saying things like &amp;amp;quot;I follow this project since 1 year and it&amp;amp;#39;s amazing&amp;amp;quot; but I checked and the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;group was created just few days ago so how they were following this project since 1 year ago?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I then decided to &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;contact on LinkedIn the 2 official admins of the project&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. They both answered me that they had nothing to do with it and clearly someone took their names and photos and posted them on that website.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;45 minutes were remaining before the private sale would start. By the way, the private sale was going to work in this way: they would publish a bsc address and everyone had to send bnb at that address. In exchange they would receive back these new tokens.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I posted in their group that admins were liars and that the people listed in the official website were not related to this project in any way.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They accused me of fud, I had no proofs. Also they were deleting most of my messages. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Then I tried what I thought was impossible, because only the worst amateur would make such a mistake: I did a whois of the domain of their website&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; and found out the website was created just 2 days ago, and I found the name and the address of the owner. This guy didn&amp;amp;#39;t even think to hide it properly.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;At this point it was just few minutes before the official launch of the private sale. I simply posted in the group the name and the home address of the scammer and then &amp;amp;quot;if anyone will be scammed, just give this name to the police&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Admins abandoned the group immediately, countdown went to 0 but no private sale started. They literally disappeared and they had no opportunity to scam anyone.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Obviously they were amateurs, it&amp;amp;#39;s harder with professional scammers, but I&amp;amp;#39;m proud that I destroyed the plan of these scammers who invested money and time in creating their website and preparing this scam.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
