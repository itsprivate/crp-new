&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;They have a live customer support 24/7, with real humans who will help to solve your issue within minutes&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;SEC and other authorities are trying to force Kraken to shut down certain products and they put a fight to still list coins like Monero&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;In the Ukraine-Russia conflict, they didn&amp;amp;#39;t ban Russian users.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
They donated to Ukrainian government, gave all Russian transaction fees to Ukraine and gave Ukrainian citizens all 1k of BTC&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;They implemented a Poof of Reserves technology, which enables the users to verify the coins actually exist on the exchange&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Kraken founder and CEO Jesse Powell warned and advised users to get their funds off exchanges, even though it might hurt their own company&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

Help me understand why I&amp;amp;#39;m wrong... Or confirm my concerns.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here&amp;amp;#39;s the problem I have with Terra:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Assume I own the entirety of Terra at the start and there are only UST Terra.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Suppose 1 Luna = 1 USD and there are 2 Luna in existence.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Suppose 1 UST = 1.01 USD and there is 1 UST in existence.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My Terra+Luna+usd universe is worth $3.01.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now suppose to peg UST, I burn 1 Luna and mint 1 UST and sell it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I get:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;1 Luna &amp;amp;gt; 1 USD (it&amp;amp;#39;s claimed, since supply went down)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;1 UST = 1 USD&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;1.01 USD&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The total value of my universe must now be worth &amp;amp;gt;$3.01, if the claim that the value of Luna rises is true.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;All I did was sell a token for the price it was worth, and suddenly it&amp;amp;#39;s claimed that the net worth of my universe is now  greater than it was.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It makes no sense to me that minting a UST token by moving value from one pool to another should yield created value in the pool that had value &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;taken from it&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This smells to me of a complicated, well obsfucated, ponzi scheme.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The more UST you mint, the less Luna there is. The drop in total minted Luna makes people *think* Luna should be worth more, so they buy it.  In reality the total network includes both Luna AND Terra and the value of Luna shouldn&amp;amp;#39;t have changed at all.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But go the other way: when people start selling their UST because they want to go back to bitcoin, they mint Luna and sell it. Now the price of Luna goes down. The fact that the price is going down and total coins minted is rising encourages the selling of Luna making the price drop farther. If the price drops too far, it can no longer support the burning of UST to get a dollar by selling Luna.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As far as I can tell, buyers of Luna are basically the pansies that are paying for the exit of UST bag holders.  Once people don&amp;amp;#39;t want to buy Luna, any remaining Luna and UST holders are screwed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It seems to be that as fast as Luna is rising, that&amp;amp;#39;s how fast it can fall.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Explain to me how this isn&amp;amp;#39;t true.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

(I keep the majority of my coins in my own wallet, but I had a small purchase I didn’t bother moving). Coinbase did offer 4% previously, but they have dramatically reduced the rewards. I just received this email. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We want to inform you about a recent change in your ALGO rewards that you might have noticed. With the transition of Algorand from a participation to governance model, the rewards rate has dropped significantly from 4% to 0.45%  as of March 8, 2022. We anticipate that you will see more fluctuations during the transitionary period.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Coinbase continues to participate in governance on your behalf and you are likely to see more governance rewards paid out in the future. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Algorand publishes regular updates on how it calculates rewards on its own website.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I have a strong feeling someone at Coinbase missed the vote and now Coinbase won’t get paid, despite them saying they continue to participate in governance. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I see two huge problems. One is governance rewards are 6-7% APY, meaning CB is collecting over 90% of the rewards they receive, and users get peanuts. Additionally, Coinbase inevitably will vote for what’s best for Coinbase, not necessarily what’s best for Algorand. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you have any ALGO sitting on Coinbase (or any exchange for that matter), I urge you to move them off the exchange and into your own wallet (MyALGO or Algorand Wallet) so you can participate in governance and get your due rewards!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: Thanks to the commenters- the official Algorand Wallet has rebranded to Pera. I use MyAlgo and forgot this change happened. Apologies for the mistake&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

About half the coins performed better than BTC since then. It&amp;amp;#39;s fine to mostly hold BTC and ETH, but this is not a reason to do so.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A year ago, the marked looked pretty great. Almost everything had been almost exclusively going up for a year, especially since November 2020. BTC was at 56k, higher than it had ever been before, and would soon reach over 60k.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Today, the situation is more complicated. The market in general has been going up and down a &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;lot&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; in the past year. Currently, the sentiment on here seems rather bearish, so I was curious: if we don&amp;amp;#39;t just look at BTC but the general market, how much worse, if at all, does the situation look today? If someone started their crypto journey a year ago today and bought a coin, how likely is it they made a profit?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So I scraped historical data from a year ago today from Coinmarketcap and today&amp;amp;#39;s prices. I looked at all coins that were in the top 200 a year ago and checked how many of them are up and how many of them are down.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There were 8 stablecoins in the top 200 back then, which of course did not really go up or down, so there are 192 remaining. Of these, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;48 (25%) increased in price since then&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. LUNA (+756%), SOL (+481%), MATIC (+397%) and MANA (+395%) performed the best since then. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;22 coins (11%) at least doubled in this time frame.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On the other hand, of course, that means &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;144 (75%) of all coins in the top 200 back then lost value. 83 (43%) of all coins lost more than half of their value and 35 (18%) lost more than 70%&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. That&amp;amp;#39;s not looking too great. The coins that performed the worst are CyberVein (-98%), ZKSpace (-96%) and  Bitcoin Standard Hashrate Token (-95%) - and I have never heard of either of them. From the slightly better known coins, the top losers are NEM, The Graph (both -84%) and SushiSwap (-83%). As a GRT hodler that hurts, even though I&amp;amp;#39;m still up from the price I bought.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;What does all of this mean? Well, not that much, but I guess it&amp;amp;#39;s obvious that, for the first time in a while, we are pretty obviously in a downward trend and have been for a while.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Some would argue it is definitely a bear market (and using a &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearmarket.asp&quot;&amp;gt;classic definition from other markets&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; we absolutely are), some would probably define everything that isn&amp;amp;#39;t a negative trend for multiple years, like 2018-2020, just temporary and not a real bear market. I have absolutely no idea what will happen next - crash, crabbing along or start of the next crazy bull run - but I thought this might interest some of you as well.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Heck i even own some myself. But most NFT&amp;amp;#39;s will all be worthless in a few years, with this i mean the simple cartoon NFT&amp;amp;#39;s with no utility or use at all. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Ofcourse NFT&amp;amp;#39;s from brands, and well known artist might retain their value. And NFT&amp;amp;#39;s with gaming utility will most likely stay. But seriously, don&amp;amp;#39;t spend your hard earned crypto on shitty pictures that someone drew in a few hours. Most peole artificially inflate the price of these NFT&amp;amp;#39;s by just buying their own. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Most likely a lot of NFT project creators will just ghost their own project, maybe even the networks hosting your images linked to the metadata that make up the NFT will be gone. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I honestly dont understand why people spend thousands of dollars on a cartoon that can&amp;amp;#39;t be used for anything else then an ugly profile picture.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;NFT&amp;amp;#39;s can be used for great things in the future, but honestly current usecases are idiotic to me.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At some point in time, Cardano was 3rd place in market capitalization behind Ethereum and Bitcoin, yet it still didn’t even have smart contracts compared to Ethereum which already had them perfected a long beforehand.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I like Cardano a lot don’t get me wrong, butI just feel like they’re very slow with development especially compared to other chains like Polygon for example.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If anything, Polygon is WAY younger than Cardano yet it still managed to get 7000+ fully functioning dApps on board a lot of which are of very high quality actually. And quiet honestly, I think a project like Polygon is more deserving of slot at the top.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cardano has &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;A LOT&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; of potential if only they improve their development timing. But for the current performance, I just think they’re very overhyped. That’s just my personal take though.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

This is a first of its kinds executive order, and its going to take a while for these separate government agencies to draft their regulations.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You&amp;amp;#39;re probably already sick of reading by now so lets get into the meat of the EO (executive order).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Preface:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;this EO will not outline specific positions that Biden wants, such as directing the SEC to take harsher penalties on rugging. He doesn&amp;amp;#39;t want to seem pro or against crypto even though this EO is pretty pro crypto.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;One part of this EO is that it will direct the US Treasury department to create a report on the &amp;amp;quot;future of money&amp;amp;quot; including how the current financial system may not be right for some current consumer needs.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;THE EXECUTIVE ORDER FOCUSES ON GROWING THE DIGIAL ASSET SECTOR SAFELY FOR CONSUMERS&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;This executive order doesn&amp;amp;#39;t create any laws or regulations. It simply forces government agencies who has been ignoring crypto to stop ignoring crypto.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The EO is regarded as a &amp;amp;quot;whole government&amp;amp;quot; effort to regulate crypto and it focuses on 6 main goals:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Consumer protection&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;: This is the chief goal of the EO and part will go to understanding the technology as well as the volatile micro and macro-economics of the crypto industry. A better understanding on the governments end will help the government better understand where the current popular financial system is failing some consumers. My opinion on this is that the government will plan on helping government agencies aid businesses in crypto adoption as an effort to lessen the massive volatility in crypto that has rekt so many people.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;financial stability&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;: this plays into the consumer protection part of the Executive Order. The president wants the financial sector to be less volatile. quoting the price pre-covid (10,300), November 2021 (70,000) and currently (38,000). Using this as a benchmark he wants government agencies to educate more people including themselves on why this volatility happens and how to help prevent this kind of instability through encouraged adoption.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;illicit uses&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;: I mean its a bunch of boomers. Did you expect them not to be scared of criminals using crypto LMAO. I&amp;amp;#39;m sure they&amp;amp;#39;re going to enact some laws that crack down on criminals using crypto which will then never be used, because they inherently cant. The EO also states that the DOJ and FBI each have their own crypto investigation units that need more funding. &amp;amp;quot;The insufficiency of international implementation of anti-money laundering networks and frameworks with digital assets is the greatest vulnerability of these ecosystems the criminals are currently exploiting.&amp;amp;quot; I mean c&amp;amp;#39;mon this senior advisor to the president is basically saying that crypto&amp;amp;#39;s worst problem is money laundering? that&amp;amp;#39;s bullish AF.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;promoting responsible innovation&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;: senior advisors have said that crypto is creating thousands of jobs in a brand new industry. Innovation is a pivotal role in the American economy and the government does not want to be left behind when it comes to innovation.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;financial inclusion&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;: This exact thing has not really been defined but I can define it, because I want to. I&amp;amp;#39;m assuming this aspect is related to the &amp;amp;quot;future of money&amp;amp;quot; publication by the Treasury as well as the future plans to evaluate the necessity of a &amp;amp;quot;digital dollar&amp;amp;quot; issued by the central banks. This will undoubtedly increase financial inclusion and level the playing field because some consumers are either scared or confused by crypto and less likely to adopt.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;U.S. Leadership&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;: This is more of an all encompassing part of the EO that is basically saying &amp;amp;quot;we need all government agencies leadership to get on the bandwagon or we as a country will fail at the innovation we have whored ourselves out for since the reconstruction era.&amp;amp;quot; The senior advisor was quoted saying, &amp;amp;quot;We remain committed to working with allies in the broader digital asset community to shape the future of digital assets systems in a manner thats&amp;amp;#39; inclusive, consistent with our Democratic values, and safeguard the integrity of the global financial system.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TL;DR: Biden signed a bullish ass executive order that begs every government agencies to stop ignoring crypto and create legislation/regulations that will protect the consumer, level the volatility, and create a level playing field for the average consumer. Citing the need for innovation as well as adoption.

Simply put, I want to express my gratitude to crypto, and how its changed my life for the better.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also, I&amp;amp;#39;d like to note that I&amp;amp;#39;m not sharing this story for pity points or some other shit like that, simply put, I want to give a small view into the life of a stranger who had some misfortunate things happen in their lives, but were able to make the best of it with the assistance of crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For context, I was crippled when I was 15, I was involved in a pretty bad collision with a vehicle, the injuries had left me unable to walk for more then a few minutes, and barely even being able to lift my arms over my shoulder height, I could barely even grip more then a few pounds. I could thankfully still stand, but daily life had greatly changed for me, and anxieties set in.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Because of my accident, to no ones surprise, companies far and wide just didn&amp;amp;#39;t want to hire me. Eventually, I had gotten reviewed and eventually accepted into a disability program. Although if I ever start working again, they&amp;amp;#39;ll remove my disability permanently, which just greatly increased my anxieties of not being able to find work I was comfortable in doing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fast forward to my early 20s, I&amp;amp;#39;ve been on disability for quite some time. I was always very interested in crypto, but never had the chance to buy in or start with it. My medical related bills always drained what little money I had. And then a big pandemic hit, and Canada had given everyone a few thousand if they needed it for emergency aid.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now of course, right away I used stimulus checks to secure food, pay off all my bills, and even bought some equipment to start exercising in hopes to repair the damage in my arms and legs to eventually get back to work. After everything was said and done, I had roughly 2.2k left over, and bought a few GPUs after really thinking about crypto and how it could benefit me in the long run.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thankfully, this was the thing that would really help me both mentally, physically, and financially. I bought the cards and power supply, already had ram and a motherboard, put it all together and started mining with HiveOS. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Let me just say, as someone who lived off of 1100$ Canadian a month, for almost 7 years, this was a major game changer for me. Suddenly, I was able to afford better food, lots more meat! I was able to pay all my bills on time, and no longer slowly came into debt, and I was, for the first time, able to lower my financial worries of being homeless if a payment suddenly didn&amp;amp;#39;t come in. The amount of joy that I had for just a few hundred extra a month was unmeasurable.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The best part for me was that the cards paid themselves off in a few months due to the boom.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fast forward to now, and even though I&amp;amp;#39;m still technically in extreme poverty, my little mining rig gives me just enough breathing room in my income that I can focus on my mental well being, and my physical well being. I cannot express my gratitude to how mining has positively effected my life.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sure, to most people getting an extra 200$-300$ a month would be effectively worthless, but that kind of money is enough to cover the power bill, my phone bill, and internet. It lets me have just enough breathing room to actually have a savings account, to be able to put money aside for my future.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Right now, I&amp;amp;#39;m planning to put some money aside to hopefully expand and get a few more cards, so I can completely get off disability, and maybe finally be able to live alone. I&amp;amp;#39;ve been doing better physically, to the point that I can even walk for over 20 minutes now! I&amp;amp;#39;m still struggling on grip and shoulder stuff, but progress is progress.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

People and VCs were incredibly high on this chain like it was the next best thing since sliced bread. Well surprise surprise. Not only did Solana turn out to be INCREDIBLY centralized, the team lied about their circulating supply twice and were caught committing fraud. That&amp;amp;#39;s a big yikes from me.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I have literally sold all my SOL,  I&amp;amp;#39;ve bought a bag of MATIC and I&amp;amp;#39;m never going back. It&amp;amp;#39;s more  decentralized (SOL has proven to be extremely centralized), The team can  actually be trusted and it&amp;amp;#39;s just an overall better chain IN MY  OPINION. I know a lot of you apes are pretty much gambling and will invest into anything even if it&amp;amp;#39;s a shitcoin. That&amp;amp;#39;s not me though and that shouldn&amp;amp;#39;t be you either.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This chain CANNOT compete with the likes of Ethereum and L2s like Polygon. Especially when Solana is a project that has literally lied to you and disrespected you straight to your face. A real shame that people will still invest in this because y&amp;amp;#39;all have no self respect lmao.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyway I went off on a bit of a rant but the point of my post is this. Do your own research, do consistent research and tune out all the noise you&amp;amp;#39;re going to be hearing. Forget about marketing and hype. You will avoid most of this game&amp;amp;#39;s pitfalls by doing your own research. The most important skill you&amp;amp;#39;re ever going to use is tuning out noise and research.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Personally, I am more on the &amp;amp;quot;block Russians wherever possible&amp;amp;quot; side - I don&amp;amp;#39;t like that &amp;amp;quot;regular people&amp;amp;quot; are being affected by that either, but it&amp;amp;#39;s how sanctions work and crypto exchanges doing it is really no different from other companies stopping to operate in Russia. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;However:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; I know that Kraken&amp;amp;#39;s CEO is a super-libertarian, so sure, that&amp;amp;#39;s not an option. I think it&amp;amp;#39;s the smartest thing they could have done. Even if I&amp;amp;#39;m against not blocking the accounts, they can now say &amp;amp;quot;but see, we are generating donations for Ukraine by doing this, do you not want us to do that?&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I personally would handle the situation differently, but I applaud them for this move. While I ideologically often disagree with their CEO, Kraken is a great exchange.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
