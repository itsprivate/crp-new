Coinbase, Gemini, and Public are just three exchanges I use, and ALL are affected by this (others include Robinhood and Venmo). When you initially make an account with one of these exchanges, they use the third-party company Plaid to connect to your bank account and verify.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Well, Plaid was accessing everyone&amp;amp;#39;s bank info, including transactions, &amp;amp;quot;anonymizing&amp;amp;quot; the data, and selling it. This is what the class action lawsuit is about. Anyone who connected their bank to an exchange or other service using Plaid before November 2021 should file a claim right now, your personal data was illegally sold. Again, you might not even remember it, you did not have to make an account with Plaid, this is just the 20 second process of using them to connect your bank. Over 5,000 apps used Plaid.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is my first time involving myself with a class action lawsuit, it&amp;amp;#39;s actually very easy. If you cannot remember or are unsure what apps used Plaid, first go to &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://my.plaid.com/&quot;&amp;gt;https://my.plaid.com/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and make an account with Plaid. When you make an account, it will tell you what connections associated with your phone number are on file. Click to view that list of connected apps that you&amp;amp;#39;ve used Plaid with.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Next, go to the settlement website: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://plaidsettlement.com/submit-claim.php&quot;&amp;gt;https://plaidsettlement.com/submit-claim.php&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fill out the form, it takes just a minute. On section two, fill out the boxes using information you got from Plaid: Bank account connected/app used (coinbase, gemini, etc)/ and approximate date of connection. Plaid will not give you an exact date, but your best guess should be good enough, anything prior to November of 2021 is valid. At the end, you can select a method to receive your settlement payout. Paypal and direct deposit into your bank are accepted.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Exact payout amounts and dates are not known, but Plaid has had to establish a settlement fund of $58 million to be divided among everyone. I can imagine that the more connections you had, the more you will get.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The final court hearing appears to be set for May 12th. Again, make sure you file your claim before April 28th of THIS MONTH. Get your money from these scummy fucks.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;E: Since there are a lot of comments asking, this is unfortunately for US citizens only, as it is being settled in a US court. A class action suit would need to be filed in your respective countries for action there.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Coffezilla made a youtube video exposing SafeMoon&amp;amp;#39;s billion dollar fraud:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;SafeMoon&amp;amp;#39;s founders and employees are currently being investigated by the FBI, while obviously having commited fraud that is documented on the blockchain and in several recordings. They even admitted deleting evidence on video. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is a fact that SafeMoon is a fraud, several employees said so themselves. There are millions of dollars missing that should be in the liquidity pool and are now in the pockets of safemoons creators. All of it can be looked up by everyone on the blockchain.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yet the safemoon subreddit calls Coffezilla &amp;amp;#39;FUDzilla&amp;amp;#39; and claims he is spreading FUD. Right now they are celebrating for buying the dip... while being 95% down from ATH.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Not everything is FUD. This echo-chamber, cult-like behaviour is sadly quite common in the crypto space, not just with meme coins like SafeMoon. Take care and think for yourself.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Golds market cap risisng from $10T to $25T is a given during a period of high inflation and financial uncertainty, and if investors are allocating the same amount to both gold and bitcoin then theres nothing to stop bitcoins market cap also rising to $25T.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That would mean a 25x rise from this point and price per bitcoin above $1 million.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Investors simply allocating the same percentage of their networth to bitcoin as they do to gold in an inflationary environment could easily mean a bitcoin price above $1 million.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

It&amp;amp;#39;s not inconceivable for stocks to enter a period of high volatility. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There&amp;amp;#39;s a lot of intense action on both sides, both for bears and bulls. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some say we&amp;amp;#39;re entering into a bear market. But other experts are talking about a period of more intense volatility instead.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Kind of like in crypto, where you&amp;amp;#39;re not necessarily in a bear market or a recession, you&amp;amp;#39;re just in a wild rollercaster of volatility. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We&amp;amp;#39;ve already seen a lot of shaky action in stocks recently. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And we&amp;amp;#39;ve seen even blue chip stocks getting hit by that volatility. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/8g685si0nku81.jpg?width=1391&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=098a200a34895dd6712a2882f05bbd203d059340&quot;&amp;gt;NFLX&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And now Netflix has dropped another 25% after hours down to $259&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They have lost subscribers. But is the market really pricing a drop in subscribers as a problem in the future of Netflix, or is this high volatility due to the Fed printer overpumping stocks, and now that the liquidity isn&amp;amp;#39;t flowing in, stocks are starting to go more wild. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can blame the macros, War in Ukraine, the end of Covid, but at the end of the day, it was likely gonna happen anyway the minute the Fed were gonna stop their money machine.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What does this mean for crypto?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If stocks become increasingly as volatile as crypto, and not a place for stability, then stock traders might as well trade crypto too.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Does this mean people will pull out of stocks and investments until things settle down?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The real question to this, is where are they gonna put their money into instead? Inflation is high, so you can&amp;amp;#39;t leave it on the sideline too long.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Other instruments have been going a little wild too. Real Estate prices have been going sky high. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Conclusion:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We may be entering into a period of wild prices across all investments. It&amp;amp;#39;s not just crypto, everything may be becoming a little more volatile. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Strap yourself in.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

This was a mistake and for more reasons than just not buying the dip.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/x7s83mffoiu81.png?width=342&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=2852345854ba278ab4962d77c543f491e6c9f042&quot;&amp;gt;MetaMask Transaction&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m not sure what exactly happened but $2K just vanished at the exchange. Looking at the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://etherscan.io/tx/0x90d233582efd622794459f84c3747b3ac41f7b295c98115946454e6c43d8282f&quot;&amp;gt;transactions&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, it looks like Rubic swapped my 4 ETH for 10,257 DAI which makes no sense, but that&amp;amp;#39;s what they did. By the time it got to the end of the transaction the math which should have looked something like this:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;(4 ETH * $3021.76) - $27.11 ETH Gas - $.15 MATIC Fee = $12,044.93&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;instead looked like this&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;(4 ETH * $3021.76) - &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;RUBIC does some shady shit&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; = $10,205.55&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/okyxz4o6oiu81.png?width=1375&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=5d5f6b227cc61502dafe344b2b211a16d254282d&quot;&amp;gt;Etherscan details&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I have since been chatting with them. It&amp;amp;#39;s been 5 days. At one point they said &amp;amp;quot;I&amp;amp;#39;ve received an update that the remaining balance (2k$) has to be saved on your account.&amp;amp;quot; But never specified which account and then backtracked when it never showed up. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/onhxwei9oiu81.png?width=375&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=8d197c72b6ebded2480cda592c9ba4e600e54ca9&quot;&amp;gt;Confirmation&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;9 times over the course of 5 days I&amp;amp;#39;ve been told it&amp;amp;#39;s being sent to their developers, but no one has coughed up the missing $2K&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They even deleted messages. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/1qdjerm2oiu81.png?width=366&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=110c55791afd0b976dd4f27bb7cfe16c006e6c17&quot;&amp;gt;Deleted message&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Talk about shady. Not sure if this is a straight up scam or their tech is just bad, but STAY AWAY FROM RUBIC.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TLDR: I sent 4 ETH ($12K) to Rubic to buy Sphere and they stole/lost $2K of it and have been giving me the run around ever since.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Note: For the record, I didn&amp;amp;#39;t just go off and try some new service without testing it first. The day before I bought $1K of Sphere just to make sure the whole thing worked and it went through just fine.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Note: I just looked at Sphere again and now it seems the default exchange is no longer through RUBIC. Interesting.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Month Twenty-Seven – UP 716%&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/lu1g7h8mhhu81.png?width=942&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=c6e0eea8c16ed1b5374b3699005a3ddfb568fc59&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/lu1g7h8mhhu81.png?width=942&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=c6e0eea8c16ed1b5374b3699005a3ddfb568fc59&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The 2020 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund consists of: &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BTC, ETH, XRP, USDT, BCH, Litecoin, EOS, BNB, BSV,&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Tezos&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;March highlights for the 2020 Top Ten Portfolio: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;100% of cryptos in the green in March, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;EOS&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; turns in the best monthly performance (+26%)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Only &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BSV&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; is under the break-even point, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BNB&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; in overall lead.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The 2020 Portfolio is the best performing of the five Top Ten portfolios, up +716%.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This group of cryptos highlights the benefits of an index fund strategy: the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;+716%&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; return of the 2020 Top Ten Portfolio has &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;outperformed eight of the individual component cryptos contained within the Index.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; Only by guessing right and throwing all your eggs into &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Ethereum&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; and/or &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Binance Coin&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; would you have performed better than spreading out the risk, index style.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;March Ranking and Dropout Report&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/k8sw8mpnhhu81.png?width=370&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=2381e7a7c1f5658be3f8b85b157d3019b7cfca96&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/k8sw8mpnhhu81.png?width=370&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=2381e7a7c1f5658be3f8b85b157d3019b7cfca96&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Top Ten dropouts since January 2020:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;  after twenty-seven, half of the cryptos that &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-ten-month-one/&quot;&amp;gt;started in the Top Ten&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; have dropped out:  &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;EOS&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BSV, Tezos, Litecoin,&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Bitcoin Cash&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; have been replaced by &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Cardano,&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;AVAX, Solana, Luna,&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;USDC.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At #64, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BSV&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; has sunk the lowest since January 2020.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;March Winners and Losers&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;March Winners&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; –  &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;EOS&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; (+26%) followed by &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;ETH&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; (+18%).  All cryptos in this portfolio finished the month in the green.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;March Losers&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; –   &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BTC&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;XRP,&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; both up +6%, still underperformed their Top Ten peers this month.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Overall Update – BNB solidly in first place, followed by second place ETH. All cryptos except BSV are in positive territory.  The 2020 Top Ten is best performing of the five Top Ten Portfolios.&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At +716%, the 2020 Top Ten Portfolio continues to be the best performing of the five &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/&quot;&amp;gt;Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. 90% of the 2020 cryptos are in positive territory, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BSV&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; the lone exception.  Most have at least &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;triple digit price growth&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; and two have &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;four digit growth&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; (&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BNB&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;ETH&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;).  Although second place &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;ETH&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; gained some ground in March, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Binance Coin&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; continues to hold a commanding lead.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The initial $100 investment twenty-seven months ago into first place &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Binance Coin&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;? Currently worth &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$3,244&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, an increase of +3,143%.    &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In second is &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Ethereum,&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; also with quadruple digit gains, up +2,626%.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BSV&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; is the worst performer in the 2020 group, down -3% since January 2020.   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Total Market Cap for the Entire Cryptocurrency Sector:&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/i4mktjerhhu81.png?width=582&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=2b8c8dba2d1f1219bd0bef3246d32e3b371e4077&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/i4mktjerhhu81.png?width=582&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=2b8c8dba2d1f1219bd0bef3246d32e3b371e4077&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As a sector, crypto is up &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;+1,031%&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; over the twenty-seven month lifespan of the 2020 Top Ten Experiment.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you were able to capture the entire crypto market since &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-ten-month-one/&quot;&amp;gt;January 2020&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; (+1,031%), you’d be doing quite a bit better than the Experiment’s Top Ten approach (+716%) and ridiculously better than the S&amp;amp;amp;P (+41%) over the same time period.  Much more on the S&amp;amp;amp;P below. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto Market Cap Low Point in the 2020 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-3&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$185B in March 2020&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;(aka Zombie Apocalypse).&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto Market Cap High Point in the 2020 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment:  &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-22&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$2.6T in October 2021&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Bitcoin Dominance:&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/749m6vvshhu81.png?width=504&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=ab710c9f4cabdc07e12c722565bd49a77999dfa9&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/749m6vvshhu81.png?width=504&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=ab710c9f4cabdc07e12c722565bd49a77999dfa9&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BitDom&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; ended March at 41%. This is near the bottom end of the range when looking at the timeframe as a whole. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here are the high and low points of &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BTC&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; domination over the twenty-seven month life of the 2020 Experiment:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Low Point in the 2020 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-24&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;40.2% in December 2021&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;High Point in the 2020 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-1-year-report/&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;70.4% in December 2020&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2020:&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/idy00jwxhhu81.png?width=337&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=f54020cb4972be90d29c1a7efa7233372b1aafce&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/idy00jwxhhu81.png?width=337&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=f54020cb4972be90d29c1a7efa7233372b1aafce&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The 2020 Top Ten Portfolio is now worth &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$8,163&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; (+716%) from the initial $1k investment.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The 2020 Portfolio remains the best performing of &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/&quot;&amp;gt;the five Experiments&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Below is a month by month ROI of the 2020 Top Ten Experiment, to give you a sense of perspective and provide an overview as we go along:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/fvjvtlbzhhu81.png?width=496&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=c9c1e9c8a75a68ef29cf884eb4c4d80d16e96dbc&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/fvjvtlbzhhu81.png?width=496&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=c9c1e9c8a75a68ef29cf884eb4c4d80d16e96dbc&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The portfolio has yet to experience a red month, although in &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-3/&quot;&amp;gt;March 2020&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; it came close, returning a COVID induced low of +7%.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So, where do we stand if we combine five years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;2018 Top Ten Experiment: up +25% (total value $1,250)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;2019 Top Ten Experiment: up +470% (total value $5,695)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-27&quot;&amp;gt;2020 Top Ten Experiment:&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; up +716% (total value $8,163) &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;2021 Top Ten Experiment: up +252% (total value $3,522)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-3&quot;&amp;gt;2022 Top Ten Experiment&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;: down -2% (total value $976)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So overall? Taking the five portfolios together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom bottom &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;bottom&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; line: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;After a $5,000 investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; the combined portfolios are worth &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$19,606.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;That’s up +292%&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; on the combined portfolios, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;down from a +533%&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-23&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;November 2021 all time high&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; for the Top Ten Index Fund Experiments. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Lost in the numbers? Here’s a graph to help visualize the progress of the combined portfolios:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/7as36e13ihu81.png?width=600&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=d0079dabf92fd62245dc37c092fbfc2f1c8a72ed&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/7as36e13ihu81.png?width=600&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=d0079dabf92fd62245dc37c092fbfc2f1c8a72ed&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In summary: &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;That’s a +292% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for five straight years&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Comparison to S&amp;amp;amp;P 500&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I’m also tracking the S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 as part of my experiment to have a comparison point with traditional markets.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/yu2an825ihu81.png?width=504&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=d817f8afe55eff22b49484bae3b8645163d9795c&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/yu2an825ihu81.png?width=504&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=d817f8afe55eff22b49484bae3b8645163d9795c&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Since the S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 has returned +41% since January 1st, 2020, that same &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-ten-month-one/&quot;&amp;gt;$1k I put into crypto&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; in January 2020 would be worth $1410 had it been redirected to the S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 instead. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto over the same time period? The 2020 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio is returning &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;+716%&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, worth &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$8,163.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;That’s a difference of $6,753.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;On a $1k investment!&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But that’s just 2020. What about in the longer term? What if I invested in the S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 the same way I did during the first five years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments since January 1st, 2018? What I like to call the world’s slowest dollar cost averaging method?  Here are the figures:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;$1000 investment in S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1,700 today&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;$1000 investment in S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1,810 today&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;$1000 investment in S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,410 today&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;$1000 investment in S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,210 today&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;$1000 investment in S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $950 today&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Taken together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom bottom &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;bottom&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; line for a similar approach with the S&amp;amp;amp;P: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;After five $1,000 investments into an S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, my portfolio would be worth $7,080.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That is up &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;+42%&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/&quot;&amp;gt;since January 2018&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; compared to a &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;+292%&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To help provide perspective, here’s a quick look at the combined five year ROI for crypto vs. the S&amp;amp;amp;P up to this point.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/tpatgve6ihu81.png?width=575&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=5565a9cda0e6cdf88ddfa6a02deea1cb3b194e0d&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/tpatgve6ihu81.png?width=575&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=5565a9cda0e6cdf88ddfa6a02deea1cb3b194e0d&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Conclusion:&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For those who have supported the Experiments over the years, thank you.  For those just getting into crypto, I hope these monthly reports can somehow help with perspective as you embark on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, think long term, don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose, and most importantly, try to enjoy the ride! Feel free to reach out with any questions and stay tuned for progress reports.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A reporting note: I’ll focus on &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-3&quot;&amp;gt;2022 Top Ten Portfolio reports&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; + one other portfolio on a rotating basis this year, so expect only two reports from me per month.  March’s extended report is the 2020 Top Ten Portfolio (the one you’re reading now).  Keep an eye out for my parallel projects tracking the Top Ten cryptos as of &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-49&quot;&amp;gt;2018 Top Ten&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; (the OG Experiment), &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-38&quot;&amp;gt;2019 Top Ten&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-12&quot;&amp;gt;2021 Top Ten&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, and &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-3&quot;&amp;gt;2022 Top Ten&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; reports as well.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The FAP (or JRKN?) coin will be distributed when two conditions are met: the pulse is over a certain threshold and the accelerometer picks up a movement matching a number of particular patterns.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;FAP will be integrated with PornHub and used to unlock unique content. When you fap to a video, the creator also earns FAP.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The value will come from users buying NFTs, devices and merch.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Where I live, the average house is around 790k (no I don’t live in a big city like Toronto or Vancouver) and rent for a 1 bedroom is averaging about $1500 a month plus utilities. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Have you ever heard your parents or grandparents say what they bought their houses/cars for? Even though their wages were slightly less, it doesn’t make up for the increase in cost of living today, not to mention inflation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Simply working more, or trying to find a high paying job isnt enough anymore. I’m starting to think crypto might be our generations once in a lifetime opportunity. My girlfriend and I are both working professionals and buying a house in this market is almost unattainable. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Which cryptos do you think will offer the best chance at making life changing money within say 5 years? Because life changing money is what it’s going to take with today’s cost of living + inflation vs current wages.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;P.S, I’m betting on Ada, CKB, Link and Ergo. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The reason is most centralised exchanges don’t allow you to withdraw XMR under fake technical reasons. Meanwhile, XMR deposits are always welcome and available.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Later, users of other cryptos recognised they can’t withdraw their funds due to fake power of liquidity. Although anonymous cryptos are affected first, some time other types of crypto were touched.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This insane situation is made possible because large centralised exchanges trend to have fake liquidity at all. That’s because their economical nature is to generate profit dependent on your buy/sell operations: no buy/sell leads to no profit. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And because crypto exchanges are not properly regulated as traditional asset exchanges, they practice to simply generate inexistent “paper” coins. You can easily trade these coins but if you try to withdraw them, you fail.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Most corrupt exchanges in that sense of “paper” coins are Binance, Huobi and Poloniex. Please don’t use that exchanges at all in the future and prepare to migrate from them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On April 18 2022, just try to withdraw all your crypto from all centralised exchanges and hence check whether exchanges of your choice do trade “paper” coins or not. If so, you can’t withdraw. Blacklist that exchanges and broadcast them to all your friends in all social media.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is extremely easy experiment, just perform your own test!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you ask where to migrate from Binance, Huobi and Poloniex, consider the following list:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://kycnot.me&quot;&amp;gt;https://kycnot.me&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Upd. XMR/BTC &amp;amp;gt; 0.006, as Monero community is the most active in April 18 event.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Upd. UTC 15:18 XMR 0.0065 @ $256. Make your XMR withdrawals from centralised exchanges on a per week basis! It works!!!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzbBi0agLNg&quot;&amp;gt;I UNCOVERED A BILLION DOLLAR FRAUD&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;hr/&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To summarise the actions of John Karony, the CEO:  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Enacted the 100% tax honeypot, covered by myself &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/tuumsi/safemoons_v1_100_tax_results_in_the_theft_of/&quot;&amp;gt;here&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, but the major story &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;as &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;though&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;tens&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;of&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;millions&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;of&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;dollars&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;stolen&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;isn&amp;amp;#39;t&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;a&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;big&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;story&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; is that he had a deal with the Crypto Exchange Bitmart, who ran their own version of Safemoon&amp;amp;#39;s &amp;amp;quot;tokenomics&amp;amp;quot; (10% buy and sell tax) - so what they would do is redistribute 5% to holders themselves, and then send 5% of transactions to Karony which Karony was supposed to add to the liquidity pool.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;Except he did not&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He appears to have kept it.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;hr/&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So what this means is that all the people that have gone blue in the face telling us that John was cleaning house, getting rid of all the bad apples.. well he was just as crooked as the rest of them. Truly a den of thieves.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Birds of a feather flock together&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What&amp;amp;#39;s mad is laying it all out...  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Kyle&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; who copy-pasted the contract kept withdrawing from the Liquidity Pool even while claiming you couldn&amp;amp;#39;t and that Safemoon was &amp;amp;quot;rugpull resistant&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Thomas&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; who lied about his Ripple job offer, lied about his development credentials and continually siphoned funds from the liquidity pool into his own wallet&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;John&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; who constantly claims Safemoon is the evolution, sets up dodgy deals with Bitmart and creates the V1-&amp;amp;gt;V2 honeypot&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It just goes on and on. Every week a new stone is unturned and people find more and more filth and scum.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But it just slides off the back of the criminally-deluded Safemoon Army. Today has seen three wallets sell $500,000 between them, and we&amp;amp;#39;re only a few hours after the wallet released. The whales are not happy about this, but the casual holders?  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here are some quotes from their sub...  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Buy the DIP, Safemoon to the moon, if you sell you, then you is a low life. LOL Dimond hands baby. We will be rich in 5 years. People fud bitcoin and look where we at 10 years later. Buy the Dip and you will be rich in 5+ years.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;1 billion volume is coming...We will be on all major exchanges soon. Love these tasty dips.   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Just watched, it&amp;amp;#39;s bad on so many levels. But he&amp;amp;#39;s at least good at editing. He makes a lot of arguments but fail to provide any proof.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;MY DUDE HE LITERALLY GAVE YOU THE BLOCKCHAIN TRANSACTION HASHES IN THE VIDEO MY DUUUUUUUUDE.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Video is pure conjecture and open-ended opinions that leads the watcher (by the nose) to form an opinion off of nothing; but it sounds good.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He&amp;amp;#39;s just after clicks and is trying to profit from spreading fud about safemoon for his own financial gain and popularity, nothing more  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I made my mind last year. I have a goal to achieve and every new wave of fud and dip that comes after is only a great way for me to buy more.   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is the biggest heads-in-sand moment I&amp;amp;#39;ve ever witnessed. When will they wake up? When John is in jail? When Safemoon is 0.00000000000000001? Or is that just another great buying OP? Fuck a rubber duck.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;If you just HODL you don&amp;amp;#39;t have to pay taxes&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;tax is theft&amp;amp;quot; &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;I should only pay tax when I cash out&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;will hopefully be packed away for at least 10 months before being brought back out again. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I’m in the same spot.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here’s my situation&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Used a bot for a long time, tax/gains to report. Have to report cost basis on tokens that are too cheap. Have 500k+ transactions, max size csv exports &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Lots of tokens for a period were small decimal project for ex: 0.00000001. Softwares can’t keep up or report on these size transactions. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Can’t import or Exports csv &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Nothing seems to be able to do it right, platforms can’t keep up.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I’m not able to import all required transactions. Definitely some terrible stuff going on this year. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Basically get audit protection. We’re screwed. Report your final numbers and pray.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;——-&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: Thank you &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/u/ChiTownBob&quot;&amp;gt;/u/ChiTownBob&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; for the sound solid advice below. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;TLDR - Import the max CSV sizes, don’t use coin tracker if you’re in this similar situation, Report end capital gains and losses, audit protection. Form 8949 as mentioned in the comments let’s you summarize, steps in comments.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;40% down in a year, but I still don’t want to sell because I don’t see any better option for me other than crypto. So I’m here until Satoshi rugpull us all or we all become rich AF.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But when TED CRUZ basically says the same thing, the crypto community says he has an ulterior motive, or they worry aloud about how this transformative technology (whose original mission statement was to separate money from State) is, heaven forbid, becoming political.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If this community is this irritated by little ol&amp;amp;#39; Ted Cruz, then I&amp;amp;#39;m afraid our sense of cohesion is in for a real bumpy ride ahead...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;[edit: As a rule, given any two parties with opinions regarding wealth redistribution, one should always expect the one who is least supportive to be the first to embrace a confiscation resistant technology like Bitcoin. So, in America, you should expect the Libertarians to support it first, followed by the Right, and eventually parts of the Left.]&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
