I was obviously prepared for spam bots etc. But still the amount of people that claimed that their low-cap coin, no one knows about with a 100M market cap or so, is 100% safe was just outrageous.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Many claimed that some low-cap coin they invested in will definitely be successful in the future and is actually 100% safe. The sad thing is that many seemed like they are not even a bot. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Maybe that Crypto won&amp;amp;#39;t crash into disappearance and actually survive but there is absolutely no guarantee that it will be profitable, especially with low-cap coins. That&amp;amp;#39;s why it&amp;amp;#39;s: higher risk, higher rewards.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Obviously a low cap coin no one knows about could possibly end up being very successful for you. So investing is not wrong. But you should know that there are probably hundreds of Cryptos doing the same thing, solving the same problem. So it&amp;amp;#39;s very hard to find something legit and uniquely new nowadays in Crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Google issued the warning on its official Chrome blog, revealing that Chrome on Windows, macOS and Linux is vulnerable to a new ‘zero-day’ hack (CVE-2022-1096). Zero-day is the most dangerous form of attack because it means the vulnerability is known to hackers before Google could issue a fix. As the company admits, “Google is aware that an exploit for CVE-2022-1096 exists in the wild.” This means every Chrome user is vulnerable.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The issue seems to be quite serious, as it&amp;amp;#39;s the only change in this build.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To force your Chrome browser to update, go to settings and there select &amp;amp;quot;About Chrome&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: this also affects Brave, so please update that too.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

When I was researching what cryptocurrency to buy, I decided I wanted a crypto that had the best balance possible of the following attributes:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;1. Decentralization&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; - Censorship resistance is the most important aspect of cryptocurrency&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;2. Environmentally friendly&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; - Consume minimal wasteful energy&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;3. Scalable&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; - More TPS = better&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;4. Fairly distributed&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; - This is important to prevent creators from dumping on the buyers&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;5. Fast&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; - Faster transactions are more convenient than slow transactions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;6. Low transfer fees&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; - Cheaper fees to send = better&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;7. Low inflation&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; - Inflation devalues existing coins and creates potential sell pressure.  It also incentivizes spending which is bad for the environment.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Below is a description of Nano in regards to the above attributes:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;1.Decentralization&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Nano has hundreds of nodes.  The below image shows the decentralization of the bitcoin mining pools.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/oanw3jskzrp81.jpg?width=715&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=dcf0c42ba2ca00dfc9c4bbb34d2e31dbb0e10eb4&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/oanw3jskzrp81.jpg?width=715&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=dcf0c42ba2ca00dfc9c4bbb34d2e31dbb0e10eb4&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And this image shows the Nakomoto coefficient of Nano.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/4smhpo0mzrp81.jpg?width=605&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=715bae19f06a67ed9fd2af2fec4d61a11e66402c&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/4smhpo0mzrp81.jpg?width=605&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=715bae19f06a67ed9fd2af2fec4d61a11e66402c&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;2.Environmentally friendly&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Nano is as environmentally friendly as they come.  Nano does not have mining.  Below is a visualization of Nano’s power consumption compared to Bitcoins.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/mpxrlc0ozrp81.png?width=1155&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=ad3981cde3af2df12ffc726fef8ccbae4100322a&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/mpxrlc0ozrp81.png?width=1155&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=ad3981cde3af2df12ffc726fef8ccbae4100322a&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;3.Scalable&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Nano does not have a hardwired limit on scalability (aka transactions per second).  Instead, Nano’s transactions per second are limited by hardware and bandwidth.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;4.Fairly distributed&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.nano.org/the-nano-faucet-c99e18ae1202&quot;&amp;gt;Nano’s distribution&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; was not perfect, but it was very close. 95% of the Nano supply was given away for free for solving captchas.  Approximately 5% was reserved for the development of Nano.  It is estimated that about .2% of the Nano supply is still in the development fund.  It is extremely important to have a fair distribution.  Without a fair distribution, founders of cryptocurrencies could rug pull and sell the tokens they own, thus crashing the price.  This image shows just how much better Nano’s distribution is than most cryptocurrencies:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/4ehzhfbpzrp81.jpg?width=761&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=8585f04432c7e1a48b63f720975a3d33b64a1f0f&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/4ehzhfbpzrp81.jpg?width=761&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=8585f04432c7e1a48b63f720975a3d33b64a1f0f&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;5.Fast&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Nano transactions reach &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;finality&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; in about .3 seconds!  This is incredible.  If you deposit Nano to an exchange, most exchanges will let you instantly trade and withdraw the funds.  This is unlike a lot of cryptocurrencies which pretend to be instant, but exchanges know they can’t trust the funds until x confirmations, which takes anywhere from seconds, to minutes, to hours, depending on the currency.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;6.Low transfer fees&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Nano is feeless!  Here is a visualization that compares Nano’s fees to other coins.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/g7bo24fwzrp81.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=a65ae739b57073df57048b745636d92f292b85a6&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/g7bo24fwzrp81.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=a65ae739b57073df57048b745636d92f292b85a6&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;7.Low inflation&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Nano has no inflation.  This is phenomenal.  Unlike most PoW and PoS coins which constantly have new coins getting minted, no new Nano will ever be minted.  This is phenomenal because at $40K per Bitcoin, $36 million dollars in Bitcoin is minted every single day.  A lot of this Bitcoin has to be sold to pay for mining costs.  This is constant sell pressure on Bitcoin’s price which Nano does not have!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Below is an image that compares Nano’s inflation (and other features) to other coins.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/gm9nxhcyzrp81.jpg?width=2047&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=fd42a4aa9243c8f711eaa31c70f5c0e73365323b&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/gm9nxhcyzrp81.jpg?width=2047&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=fd42a4aa9243c8f711eaa31c70f5c0e73365323b&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One complaint I have heard about Nano is that it does not have smart contracts.  This was an intentional design feature of Nano.  By being simple, Nano is able to have faster transactions and less chance of exploitation (to this day, Nano has never had a double spend).  I also personally believe decentralized finance is the number 1 use case of crypto (it is Bitcoin’s sole use case), and Nano does it better than any other cryptocurrency.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Here is a video showcasing Nano:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR9U32u8ulE&quot;&amp;gt;Nano in the Real World: Lightning Fast | No Fees | Global Payments&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Disclaimer:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I did my best to post accurate information.  If I made any errors, please let me know.  This is not investment advice.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Edit 1:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One of the main concerns people posted is that since Nano is feeless, people are not incentivized to run nodes.  This is incorrect.  Bitcoin has mining fees and miners are paid to mine bitcoin.  However, Bitcoin also has nodes and Bitcoin node operators are paid no fees (they get none of the mining reward).  Yet, thousands of Bitcoin nodes are run by people to verify the ledger.  Nano nodes, like Bitcoin nodes, also verify the ledger.  Since running a node is a way to verify your holdings, businesses and people are incentivized to run them.  Just like with Bitcoin, finding enough people to run nodes has been a non-issue for Nano.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That’s how it’s going to be with crypto wallets, right now we all have multiple apps of multiple wallets, Coinbase, Kraken, Binance, all of them, but that will be a thing of the past.        &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Similar to how I can tap my side button twice and pay with the debit card that I connected on Apple Pay - soon I will be able to do the same thing and pay with a choice of assets, my Bitcoin, my stablecoin(s), or my debit card.             &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It’s just a matter of time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The only reason there is a chance to get wealthy of it with a relatively small investment, is a massive risk associated with it. Those are the facts. Do you really want THIS to be your &amp;amp;quot;only way&amp;amp;quot; to change your life? The ground you are building on is a pretty shaky one, mate.
But there is a great upside to this! It does not take much time to bet on crypto. Don&amp;amp;#39;t chase every pump, inform your self periodically, invest what you can lose and you are golden. Now you can take time and actually work towards a goal you have some control over! Even if it seems hopeless and you fail, there is always something you will take from it. Constantly try to evolve in even the smallest things. I know how easy it is to resign yourself to your perceived &amp;amp;quot;faith&amp;amp;quot;, but by doing it you lose all the chances you never knew you had.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

To make quick money. &amp;amp;quot;Why do you care about price going up or down if you are never selling?&amp;amp;quot; and other silly arguments.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And let me tell you. Yes the majority here, is in it for the money. It&amp;amp;#39;s because we are screwed. The society is still expecting an average male to earn a lot of money and provide for their family etc. but people in their 30s have been f**d in the arse for the last 15 years or more. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;No wage growth, no prospects in many countries, constant financial crisis that keeps hitting and hitting us from all sides, and now inflation which will melt our savings, that is if we are lucky to have any savings in the first place, education system is a joke in most countries, crippling debts, high cost of living, rents going up and up, and so on and on, I could go on forever.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto for a lot of us is the only way out, our only way to be able to afford a house or a flat in the future. So yeah, you bet I&amp;amp;#39;m in it for the money and I don&amp;amp;#39;t give a damn what people think. Priority number one for me is to provide for my family.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Ive been into BTC for nearly 2 years now. The longer time carries on, the farther down the rabbit hole I go.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Typically, I have been DCA&amp;amp;#39;ing every pay day up until a week ago. I have always thrown whatever extra change and money I have laying around into it. I no longer buy stocks as it always feels too much like a gamble. I can never just be happy holding stocks. It was like chasing a high finding the next &amp;amp;#39;money maker.&amp;amp;#39; The banks must have loved me and all the stupid fee&amp;amp;#39;s Id pay buying and selling as I carry on the chase.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But then Bitcoin entered my life. And life became easier. Stocks became meaningless. A Maxi I became. No more stocks. Savings being placed entirely into the soundest money of all time: Bitcoin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fast forward to January. My father has a fatal, and extremely rare stroke; a Cerebellar Stroke. You would never have seen it coming. Not your typical stroke symptoms. 2 weeks later after a battle in ICU he passed. He didn&amp;amp;#39;t leave much. He was a free spirit. Retired early, and lived and travelled in a van. My step-mom, who he divorced a decade ago, kept paying his life insurance that he neglected to pay.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So with many thanks to my step-mother, I received inheritance.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;First thing I did, I paid off debts. Helped the wife pay down a lot of debt. Upgraded the house.... slightly. Nothing too major.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Im keeping a bit of fiat in savings. Sadly, letting it get eaten away from inflation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The rest, I dedicated to buying up the remainder of what I need of a whole BTC. Total cost roughly, $35,000 USD.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Enter: The Royal Bank of Canada. Canada&amp;amp;#39;s biggest bank. A bank of which I have been with for many a year. I have savings accounts with them. I have a larger LOC with them. I used to use their investment services.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Banks are not your friends. I am aware of this.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But, honestly, its 2022. The banking system is stuck in the 1980&amp;amp;#39;s.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This past Monday, March 21st, I went to the bank to wire the $35K to NDAX, a leading Canadian Crypto Exchange (0.2% buy fee, $15 transfer out fee). Did the paperwork, confirmed the info, and boom, done. Later, the advisor from the bank called to ask me some questions from the Anti-Money Laundering department. Cool, a couple verification questions. I answered honestly. Advisor said &amp;amp;quot;great, expect to receive the wire tomorrow.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Tuesday, nothing received. This is a domestic wire transfer. Should take a day, tops.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Wednesday, March 23rd, Im in the bank again. Branch manager tells me the wire was flagged as &amp;amp;quot;too risky.&amp;amp;quot; You cannot imagine the disbelief in me. The bank was deeming what I was doing with my money as &amp;amp;quot;too risky.&amp;amp;quot; As if they had some control over what I choose to do with my money. Its sad enough its 2022, and there isn&amp;amp;#39;t an easier way to send $35K, which honestly isn&amp;amp;#39;t even that much damn money in todays age.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After raising a stink, and showing the branch manager my Bitcoin tattoo, I informed him I was &amp;amp;quot;WELL AWARE OF THE RISKS.&amp;amp;quot; I also had to mention that its risky leaving my savings in a bank that has a less than 1% interest rate in their savings accounts. I was asked to show proof that I have dealt with NDAX before. I was asked if anyone told me Id make a fortune buying BTC? Standard money-laundering questions. Check-Check-Check. Passed the test, AGAIN.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Manager put a word in with Wire Transfer department, and the money was finally taken from my account.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thursday rolls around now. Still, nothing. Nothing at all. Money, stuck in limbo somewhere. In some sort of electronic bank cloud.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Today. Friday. Guess where I am again for a 3rd time? The fucking bank. More times in 1 week than in 2 years. Remember everyone... its 2022. Nope, sorry, I cannot call them because when it comes to wires I have to physically enter the branch I sent the wire from.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This time I get branch manager involved, a co-manager involved, and of course an advisor. All looking into this shit for me. Im livid. Its Friday. The original wire was supposed to be sent Monday. Tomorrow is a weekend. WTF?!?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Turns out, under money-laundering investigation, AGAIN. More questions asked. Anyone put you up to this? Have you used NDAX before? How did you hear about them? Are you going to do business with them again? Blah blah blah. I passed again. I was told then to await an email or a phone call when this has all been settled. 2 hours pass. I email the branch manager, livid. Nothing still.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then, around 3PM, I was told the money was released.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Guess I have to wait the weekend to receive it on Monday. Those fuckers at the bank!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But no! As soon as NDAX received it into their processing, I received the wire transfer! 530PM Pacific time! Last minute.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Of course everyone will say &amp;amp;#39;HEY! DCA that shit!&amp;amp;quot; I get it. I DCA&amp;amp;#39;d for so long that it was just nice to cop what I needed and throw it into Cold Storage. The few dollars Id save DCA&amp;amp;#39;ing mean nothing to me in 10 years. Its nice to just have a solid 1/21,000,000, and to take it off the market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But that&amp;amp;#39;s not the total point of this at all. We need to all be happy for each other for any amount of BTC we have at any cost we got it. This is the future. This is the sound choice.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The point is this tho:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Banks are not your friends. Banks consider you GUILTY UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT when wiring any sort of money.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I started writing a piece about why we shouldn’t mind KYC unless we’re criminals, and through my journey, I realized I was totally wrong.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;First, there’s a data breach; once a hack happens on all KYC data, the amount of info they will get would be astounding. They could literally take your ID and sell them to identity thieves if they don’t use them themselves. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The second is that all of that information you supply can be used against you without a warrant. Of course, if you are not a criminal, you think you have nothing to worry about. But there are more instances than not of people being wrongly implicated in crimes.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Third, people have to go through a lot of fucking shit to provide the necessary assets for KYC, and some people don’t have the means to do that. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This was definitely a lesson in DYOR for me. A total turnaround in viewpoint.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This includes a flat 30% tax on all crypto trades.. because the govt enabled and helped you to trade right? 🤷&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also you cant claim capital losses, but have to pay capital gains. Lol..&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And the worst of the lot, each time you trade, you have to remit 1% of the trade to the government as tax deducted at source. For example if you buy $100 BTC, you pay $1 right away, the seller is supposed to deduct this..so you only get $99. This will kill market makers who make hundreds of trades every day to provide liquidity. Imagine if they have to pay 1% on each trade, their capital is going to get sucked out pretty hard. As a result you will have very thin order books on CEX as market makers will exit. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Since the laws are kicking in soon, Monero p2p platforms have gained some popularity. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is a popular Monero platform that was almost a ghost town even in January with hardly any traders,  but all of a sudden there are dozens of sellers there with hundreds if not thousands of trades. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/157b7pplfjp81.jpg?width=2726&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=ec252c8e69e6fa35fe7f24dc6fcf796f50deec7f&quot;&amp;gt;Monero p2p boom&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bisq has not seen much growth though, as it has a steeper learning curve.. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These laws show the government is clueless as to what crypto is and how much . As ZK tech becomes more popular, it would be much more easier trading P2P crypto with one another&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I mean literally every other top 10 crypto has flaws (also BTC and ETH have those) and especially some uncertainty. Tether is obviously doomed, XRP is battling in court, SOL is going out every month, LUNA is too new to tell, ADA is more buzz than actual stuff, and the list goes like that for every crypto according to me.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We have seen a couple of top 10 cryptos over the past few years loose out completely. So what do you think? Is there any coin that actually has capability to survive anything and always stay where it is today?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Smart contract compatibility with contract to contract calls.  This allows complex dApps to be built that can efficiently and trustlessly interact with other smart contract based dApps to extend functionality and usability.  Additional details and background on this tech can be found &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/algorand/hello-contract-calling-abff8fc00939&quot;&amp;gt;here&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Post-quantum secure &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Falcon Keys&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, Algorand’s first major milestone on its path towards trustless cross-chain interoperability.  These keys will, in the near future, be used to generate &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;State Proofs,&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; a new blockchain infrastructure that will allow Algorand to be trustlessly accessed in low-power environments like mobile phones, smart watches, and on other blockchains. For more background on State Proofs, please see an overview &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/algorand/algorand-state-proofs-707d64038e35&quot;&amp;gt;here&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Developers are now able to build complex dapps for the Algorand ecosystem with smart contract-to-contract calling and network participants can take their first step towards trustless cross-chain interoperability with quantum-secure keys for the upcoming State Proof technology. These network upgrades come on the heels of a $20 million incentive program from the Algorand Foundation focused on developer tooling and&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://algorand.foundation/news/10-million-evm-compatibility-grant&quot;&amp;gt; EVM compatibility&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, putting Algorand at the forefront of blockchain interoperability and post-quantum security while providing features for even more advanced decentralized applications. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These features add to Algorand’s already advanced tech, high performance and robust developer resources. Smart contracts on Algorand can be written in Python or Reach, making it accessible for developers of all skillsets. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Algorand has experienced zero downtime since launch, helping it become the blockchain of choice for hundreds of organizations launching DeFi protocols, NFTs, payment solutions, regulated digital assets, and more. The network supports applications that can scale to billions of participants, all on a high-speed, carbon-negative, secure and stable blockchain. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

(Looking at Syria, Venezuela.. etc) All those thinking they sit on a moral high ground calling for the hunger of millions of people are disgusting double standard subhumans that have no empathy for their fellow human. I&amp;amp;#39;ve seen people dying of hunger in the streets and guess what ? The governments are still strong and standing cause this isn&amp;amp;#39;t a fairy tail where the good side always wins.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Double standard cause the US have done far worse than this in literally every war they financed and/or were directly involved with, yet if anyone mentions this they&amp;amp;#39;re accused of being Putin apologists.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I can&amp;amp;#39;t fathom how cruel some people can get and calling for the hunger of a whole nation because of the actions of their fucked up dictator ! Do you (americans) think that you, your families and tour children deserve to suffer and famined because of your government&amp;amp;#39;s actions in the middle east, Latin America and around the world ? Do you ?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fuck every single government. Power to the people.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You don&amp;amp;#39;t understand the basics of decentralisation, it&amp;amp;#39;s NOT hooray decentralisation unless some with a different belief system is using it. God I hate this sub lately&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit : I mentioned the US doing far worse to point out that the American people DON&amp;amp;#39;T deserve living in a famine for their government&amp;amp;#39;s actions, same like the Russian people or any other nation&amp;amp;#39;s people for that matter. Not because I&amp;amp;#39;m pro-dictatorship like people are accusing me of.. but I think I won&amp;amp;#39;t defend myself anymore cause some people are so agenda oriented and so blind to the truth even if you hit them in the face with it, and will always see anyone who speaks out against the state media points as &amp;amp;quot;Puting apologist&amp;amp;quot; or &amp;amp;quot;pro-dictator&amp;amp;quot; or whatever new trendy name is used for public shaming anyone who thinks outside the flock&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Everyday political variations, wars and agreements are something that cannot be predicted but it can affect the crypto market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The issue is you can’t unstake without sacrificing a whopping 4-10%, which is unfortunately considering there are so many better deals now for ETH deposits (CDC, for example, offers 4.5-6.5% on a 3 month term).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Moral Of The Story: Read the T&amp;amp;amp;Cs and don’t take a bad deal just because it’s the only deal you have in front of you. Remember that something better might come tomorrow!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While personally, I still have no regrets as it forces me to hold and at time I didn&amp;amp;#39;t have a clue on hard wallets at the time, this is why you must read those tiny little letters when you agree to something (agreement details). Since learning a bit more, new ETH I have bought are stored elsewhere.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I knew this would happen eventually, but there are many people that click the agree button without reading the agreement and then blame the service.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So for those not staking yet, check your options. There are some that are better like Blockfi, Celsius and others which you don&amp;amp;#39;t have a lockup period and you can pull out as needed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However, don&amp;amp;#39;t forget that banks are not here for you. They aren&amp;amp;#39;t here as a benevolent force of good. They just want to front run their own creative destruction. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Remember what early Bitcoiners had to face to reach this stage of adoption, they had to fight off constant criticisms from all sides, especially the banks and their stooges.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;By all means celebrate the adoption, but also remember the roots of this entire revolution. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Rant over. Peace out.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;ANZ said it has delivered the Australian dollar stablecoin, which it calls A$DC, to a private wealth management firm for digital assets. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is insanely bullish for crypto and Australian investors in particular. The the government is currently undertaking deep investigations into the potential use for digital assets.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
