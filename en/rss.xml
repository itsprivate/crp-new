And at this time ETH was around 1500.  So I like any newbie not wanting to miss out on big gains aped in my 1k.  And although I’ve turned out fine, learned a lot, had some losses but mostly gains, I am still pretty pissed and disturbed by bitboys content.  Watching him guarantee a 10k ETH and 200k BTC by Sept. 2021 is fucking outrageous and I really don’t understand how things like that are allowed.  All you really have to do is say “NFA” and you’re in the clear to promise whatever you want? You can shill hopium to people who have no clue what they’re doing?  Although I turned out fine, watching him talk about leverage trading and $600 XRP should be fucking illegal.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyways that’s my little vent. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Don’t listen to BitBoy&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

About exactly 4 months ago end of sep/beginning Oct we were at the same cycle spot of disbelief. Disbelief meaning that the current rally is under disbelief by many as we were having so much downs and fake breakouts recently.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;From sep we went from disbelief to complete euphoria in under a month. The great Uptober. It was the best time for me in crypto, daily big green candles and then that ATH melting faces. Complete euphoria.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Well what happened after that is the turn of the cycle. Panic followed by capitulation and anger. Now we are back at the disbelief stage and ready for the next crazy ride.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This four months show you the entirety of Crypto. Surving those are not easy, many did not. But those who did, hats off. We went through done dark times with the light at the end of the tunnel but are still back here, in the middle of the light.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Shutting down FB is honestly not that bad (aside of logins associated with it on other sites), but it clearly shows what CEO can do to you and how much power he can have.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This should be a lesson to everyone - centralized projects are a risk, no matter if it&amp;amp;#39;s so called crypto, banks, governments or various platforms.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Having no CEO, presidents, ministers solves this. BTC solves this.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Of course if the plan is to trade in the short term, look for trends to capitalise of off; but if you are simply looking for a longer term investment, look beyond a bull market (if this is one).

Was there something in particular that can be attributed to the turnaround? Just not sure where all the current resilience and market confidence is coming from.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I have been hesitant ever since it was signaled that there would be an announcement from the White House on how they wanted to “enforce rules around crypto as a matter of national security”. I’m sure this announcement will be something close to what India has done with their 30% but there is no way to know.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Also all the websites have affiliate links for each Airdrops...
So, the question is what Airdrops are for?
Build fake hype
Sell useless/fake crypto, nft or whatever
Accumulate KYC data for future projecs or just to sell them
Rug pull
Pump and dump
Ect...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s better to stay away from all of them, than to send your credentials to every one.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Stay safe&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit : Cosmos and ATOM are the 1% of great airdrops. And please don&amp;amp;#39;t count the old ones during good times, I&amp;amp;#39;m talking about nowadays.. Stop it with BTC faucet, ETH airdrops or Uni swap airdrops years ago.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

And today, one of Canada&amp;amp;#39;s largest auditing and verification firms announced that they have purchased BTC and ETH for the first time ever!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The firm, KPMG, is a major player in Canada. It&amp;amp;#39;s been around for more than 150 years and employs nearly 8,000 people. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here&amp;amp;#39;s what they had to say : &amp;amp;quot;Investors such as hedge funds and family offices to large insurers and pension funds &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;are increasingly gaining exposure to cryptoassets&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; (...). This investment reflects our belief that &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;institutional adoption of cryptoassets and blockchain technology will continue to grow&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; and become a regular part of the asset mix.&amp;amp;quot; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For me, this news is absolutely a bullish sign. No matter what the haters and no-coiners think, crypto is here to stay, and this kind of news proves it. Institutions have only just set foot in it: we are still very early! Just think about it : if you hold long enough, you will probably end up selling your tokens to Wall Street big boys in a few years. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We are, indeed, all gonna make it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When put to scientific tests it doesn&amp;amp;#39;t hold up against empirical evidence. Analysts consistently looking at different indicators and hedge their analysis. Often going BACK to data and drawing lines saying LOOK LOOK it broke the barrier line trend hill thing! SEE!           &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Listen - if this stuff actually worked - we would have giant AI computers dedicated to learning how to do it - oh that&amp;amp;#39;s right we do - and you know what happens when we plug them in to the system? The system figures it out and reacts differently. The global mood changes on a dime and all TA goes out the door with it.         &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;tldr; IT IS NOT OBJECTIVE.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;         &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Let me be clear, there ARE definite patterns within the stock market, and if they are recognized they can be successfully traded upon, but analyst cannot separate themselves from their beliefs and pre-dispositions, they selectively, and possibly sub-consciously, choose charts and TA indicators that confirm what they have already concluded.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I mean it&amp;amp;#39;s right to some extent that crypto is using electricity that is unsustainable for mining. With that dancing the environment. But those people are onto some other stuff. Many thinking that all 5k cryptos use mining that is 100% unsustainable.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So let&amp;amp;#39;s be clear very few cryptos nowadays use pow and even then the energy for mining is getting more and more sustainable. At least already more than their beloved banks.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Seeing so many people uneducated about crypto but spreading hate shows how much growing room we still have left.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Posting this for several years!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Around the same amount that last week. We are looking for around 110 BTC monthly. Way lower that years ago.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Reason? New exchanges, where Binance is king, &amp;amp;quot;the&amp;amp;quot; P2P (with all the risk involved) option to go, not only BTC but other crypto and stablecoins. Easiest way of purchase BTC with devaluated Bolivares (Bs.)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sadly, Binance doesn&amp;amp;#39;t offer the stats of the amound traded. But it is safe to assume Binance (And other exchanges like Reserve and AirTM) has absorbed all the amount that LocalBitcoin used to trade.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Monthly minimum wage is 2 USD that is for public workers and they receive some kind of incentives (a monthly box of food that is around 20 USD), you cannot live with that.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;If that is you only income, you died years ago starving or your family is helping inside Venezuela or from abroad or you have another job or you left the country (even walking).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Average monthly wage is around 90 USD (Monthly). A Manager is around 210 USD (monthly). &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://talcualdigital-com.translate.goog/ovf-salario-promedio-del-sector-comercio-subio-un-71-a-892-durante-2021/?_x_tr_sl=es&amp;amp;amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;amp;amp;_x_tr_hl=en-US&amp;amp;amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp&quot;&amp;gt;https://talcualdigital-com.translate.goog/ovf-salario-promedio-del-sector-comercio-subio-un-71-a-892-durante-2021/?_x_tr_sl=es&amp;amp;amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;amp;amp;_x_tr_hl=en-US&amp;amp;amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Some NGO say around 500 USD monthly are needed for a 5 members family to &amp;amp;quot;live&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;There are in fact so many places (department stores, big ones like Traki, Biomercados) where you can pay directly with crypto. People always use stablecoins like &amp;amp;quot;USDT&amp;amp;quot; (what a fear), USDC, BUSD, AirUSD and so on.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;2021 inflation was around 700%.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Any question, feel free to ask.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
