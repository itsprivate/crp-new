Its renouned worldwide . Bottles  of wine start at $500. All that to say that the food should be amazing.  Only for you to be served chicken tendies and soggy fries from the kids  menu.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You look around then down at your plate. &amp;amp;quot;I thought this was supposed to be good?&amp;amp;quot; You think to yourself.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here comes your buddy, the guy who invited you to the restaurant. (Put in his entire life savings in at $0.35)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Told you this place is the shit bro.&amp;amp;quot; Your buddy says as he sits down and is served a TV dinner from Banquet.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Oh  yeah the food isn&amp;amp;#39;t great... right now. But wait until later trust me  bro.&amp;amp;quot; He says as he starts to unwrap the plastic film with a big grin on  his face.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Just as you were about  to take a bite of your tendie Allincrypto sits down at your table. &amp;amp;quot;Sup  boys, Allincrypto here.&amp;amp;quot; Then immediately takes a bite of a turd Charles  Hoskinsin layed on his plate.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Oh my favorite!&amp;amp;quot; He says as he leans forward and eats the log apple bobbing style with no hands.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Don&amp;amp;#39;t think about your food now. Think about the filet mignon of tomorrow.&amp;amp;quot; As he goes in for another bite.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Disgusted,  you look out the window at a run down diner across the street. You peer  into the window and see families laughing and having a good time. You  see the waitress walk over to the table with what looks like a bacon  cheeseburger and a new york strip steak.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Wow that looks pretty good.&amp;amp;quot; You mutter to yourself.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Just as you say that Allincrypto and your buddy surround you.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;That place is so shit.&amp;amp;quot; They say in unison as they both proceed to shut the curtains from each side.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Right before the curtains fully close you look up at the neon sign above the diner. It reads &amp;amp;quot;Ethereum diner&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You turn around and stand up. Everyone in the restaurant has stopped eating and is glaring at you in complete silence.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Hail Hydra&amp;amp;quot; they start chanting.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They all get up and start to surround you while still chanting &amp;amp;quot;Hail Hydra&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A woman shouts from the back, &amp;amp;quot;Hydra will save us! Kill the non believer!&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Im  sorry! I will eat my tendie please don&amp;amp;#39;t hurt me! That place across the  street sucks.&amp;amp;quot; But it doesn&amp;amp;#39;t work and they proceed towards you slowly.  You shut your eyes and prepare for the worst.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You suddenly wake up in your bed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Omg it was a dream. Thank god.&amp;amp;quot; You think to yourself.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You pull out your phone to look at your portfolio.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;$10,000 bought at $2.68. Portfolio down 69.420%&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You  walk over to the bathroom and catch a glimpse of yourself in the  mirror. You smile with a tear rolling down your cheek. You notice your  teeth are smeared with shit.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;I wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t have it any other way.&amp;amp;quot; You think to yourself.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You proceed to go on Reddit to post about the new Solana outage and check what new features are coming soon to Cardano.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You look right into the camera. After a long pause you smile and shout &amp;amp;quot;Hail Hydra&amp;amp;quot; at the top of your lungs.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The  camera zooms away from your face and out of your RV thats parked in  front of your step dads house and the credits start rolling.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fin&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After first learning about bitcoin in 2012, and feeling like I missed the boat in the 2013 bull run, I decided to start buying modest amounts in January 2014. In hindsight they weren&amp;amp;#39;t modest at all. I was buying .5 or entire bitcoins every month. Over the next 2 years, I accumulated (and spent) anywhere between 6-12 btc. I wasn&amp;amp;#39;t super detailed with my records at the time, and I spent a bunch of it frivolously. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I ended up buying a house in 2016, and I sold the rest of my stack for the down payment, just before the 2017 run up to 20k, so I missed out on all those gainz. Over the next 2 years I didn&amp;amp;#39;t buy anything, but I still watched the market. In 2019 I started buying again. It has taken over 2 years, but I have successfully joined the &amp;amp;quot;10 millionth club&amp;amp;quot; (2.1btc is a 10 millionth of the entire bitcoin economy). To think I had a realistic shot at 21btc if I&amp;amp;#39;d just stuck with it. Ah well. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyway, the point of this post is to say keep stacking and hodling. We are still early, even though we always feel late. Pretty weird.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;tldr&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; i just dca&amp;amp;#39;d for 2 years and now I have 2.1 btc&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Lately I’ve noticed lots of people here heavily over leveraged in CRO attempting to obtain the next level of card. Don’t get me wrong, the benefits are great, but BENEFITS ALONE could never warrant putting such a high percentage of your portfolio into a project that has a lot to prove. While CRO is far from a shitcoin, it is also far from a blue chip, and if crypto.com doesn’t flourish, the coin itself really has little to no use. If you’re shooting for the next card up remember, it’s not a race, slowly work your way there as your portfolio grows.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;EDIT - First of all, I should have said “over allocating”, not over leveraging. I thought it was obviously enough but that’s on me.   Second, not spreading fud, not scoffing at cro. I’m saying the card and rewards are great, Just a reminder not to over allocate your portfolio for any type of rewards with any company&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

There are many ways to boost your gains, this includes lending, staking, liquidity providing, etc. You can do this with CeFi and DeFi. This is an updated attempt to provide guide for begginers, but even experieneced user might find some useful tips.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;First let get some terms right:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Staking&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; - refers to generating income by block generation on Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchains. The term is heavily misused everywhere, so nowadays it can mean anything from staking to liquidity providing&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Lending&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; - you lend your crypto and get interest. Counterparty does anything it want with it and hopefully pays back some day.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Liquidity providing (LP)&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; - you provide two (sometimes even more) cryptocurrencies to a DEX (decentralized exchange), so people can trade. You get your share of trading fees.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;CeFi&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; - centralized companies, you can lend them your coins, they pay you interest.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;DeFi&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; - decentralized (well, at least in theory) applications like DEXes, lending apps etc&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Risks&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There are obviously risks that come with all this, so beware. CeFi can get hacked, can scam you, can bankrupt. DeFi can get hacked, can scam you and its happening a lot. With staking you can get slashed (happens rarely), but if you delegate your funds to a validator, he can misbehave (depends on specific chain what he can or cant do). When doing LP, you face impermanent loss, in addition to all the DeFi risks.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;How to get yield&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now lets get to generating some money, starting from the simplest options.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;CeFi&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Probably easiest thing to do is to lend your coins to a big CeFi lender, like Celsius. They have been around for a while, have $20B in assets under management and among CeFi its as safe as it gets. But their rates are somewhat lower than what competitors can pay you. Rates for different coins are a lot different and every CeFi lender has different rates for the coin, so you can optimize by using several CeFi. When deciding between platforms these are important things to consider: rates, security, jurisdiction, withdrawal fees, how customer support works. Also not every lender will be available in your country.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
Where to find best rates:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://coinlenders.net/&quot;&amp;gt;https://coinlenders.net&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; - this a is site i put together myself, you can search for rates among several CeFi and DeFi lending platforms. Just select a coin and see what your options are.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Note that most of the CeFi platforms have tiered system, meaning you can get best rate on limited amount - if that affects you, consider splitting funds between multiple platforms to get best value. It also helps with diversification.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
StakingIf you have Proof of Stake coins, than very likely staking will be safest option with great return. Many CeFi providers will just stake the coin for you and take their cut for doing this, so consider doing it yourself.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Typical yield for stablecoins is 10-12%, 5-6% on bitcoin and ether.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There are services that promise a way bigger yield than this, but i don&amp;amp;#39;t find them trustworthy enough for sharing. But just in case you want to gamble, know that if you look, you can find yields like 15-30% on btc - but dont be suprised if you end up with nothing...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;DeFi&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Moving to DeFi. First of all try to eliminate unnecessary risks by obtaining HW wallet. Ledger or Trezor. Chose wisely according to the chains you wanna use, not all chains are supported. If possible, go for the Nano X or Model T, as these support all the modern stuff. Learn to use Metamask with you HW wallet, it will work well for all the EVM chains.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;DeFi lending&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Just like CeFi, you can just lend you coin with some lending protocol like AAVE, Compound etc. Most of the DeFi protocols issue its own token, and sometimes they will give some as incentives to lenders, borrowers or liquidity providers. This is additional yield, sometimes these rewards are locked for some time, so there is a risk of the incentive token losing lot of value before you can sell. Interest rates are usually adjusted to current market situation and change a lot, so you need to monitor it.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
Where to find good rates?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://coinlenders.net/defi-lending&quot;&amp;gt;https://coinlenders.net/defi-lending&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://coindix.com/?kind=single&quot;&amp;gt;https://coindix.com/?kind=single&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;DeFi - liquidity providing&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Liquidity providing is another great way to generate yield. You provide some liquidity to a DEX, in return you get fees and sometimes also incentive tokens. Usually you need to provide two assets in 50:50 ratio, which makes it more complicated. Understand, that by providing liquidity you are basically putting you assets for sale and you no longer have direct exposure to their price, so if the price in the pair changes, you will find that you own different amount of tokens and always, you will own more of the worse one.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
This is called impermanent loss, but there is nothing really impermanent about it, its quite normal loss. To avoid impermanent loss you can chose a pool with currencies of equal or correlated value, like USDC-USDT. Also note that due to the impermanent loss, if one token loses 100% of value, you lose everything in the pool not just half - because you will be left with with 100% of the worthless one, due to arbitrage. Sometimes with the LP pools you will see ridiculous APYs like 1000000%, that does not mean you are getting rich. The reason for these crazy APYs is usually one of these:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;its a new platform and it will go down quickly as more liquidity is added&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You need to but hyperinflating token which will lose a lot of value over time, negating the gains&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Its very unsecure/untrustworthy platform with high risk of getting robbed&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Where to find the best pools? Here are some resources to help:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;How to handle incentive tokens/rewards&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
You usually will want to sell it and add to your lending/LP positions to get compounding effects. These incentive tokens are normally very inflationary and are losing value quickly, especially when the protocol is new. Claiming the rewards and swapping it on DEX are transactions which can cost you tx fees, so if this is on expensive chain like Ethereum, this is only profitable for whales basically. Solution is to use automatic compounders, like Autofarm, more on this later. When the reward is locked for some time, it may go down a lot during this period, and your yield will be smaller than expected. Be sure to include this in your risk assessment.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Advanced strategies&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When you get familiar with DeFi, you might want to try some advanced stuff, combining multiple protocols together to boost your yields even further. These come with more risk and usually involve some kind of leverage, so be careful. There are plenty of options, lets check some usual or popular options.Some of these strategies:  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Recursive lending&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is when you lend your asset to a DeFi protocol and borrow it right back, then supply it into the same protocol. You can do the loop several time until limit is reached, the limit is a function of collateral factor. So lets say you deposit $1k and collateral factor is 80%, you can max you position to 1/(1-CF), so to $5k deposit and $4k borrow position. There will be a lot of transactions doing this, so you need cheap chain or big deposit to be worthy. This strategy is profitable if deposit interest is bigger than borrow interest, which is possible when incentive token rewards are high. But you will need to do constant compounding to avoid liquidation (without it your debt grows). You need to monitor the incentive token price and the APYs, so you can recognize when its no longer profitable.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tranquil.finance/&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.tranquil.finance/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; is one place this is possible at this moment&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Lend and borrow, then put into LP&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some protocols do not allow recursive lending, you can maybe circumvent this with multiple accounts, or you can do something else, like deposit USDT, borrow USDC, sell half of the USDC for USDT and put it in LP pool. Again, you need high incentive token rewards to make it profitable.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Automated compounding&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As compounding on some platforms is costly due to blockchain fees, solution is to use automated compounder, like Autofarm, which does all the work for you in optimal way. You add some risk by doing this, if the auto compounding protocol gets compromised, you also lose your deposit.Examples:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Autofarm: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://autofarm.network/&quot;&amp;gt;https://autofarm.network/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Beefy: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://beefy.finance/&quot;&amp;gt;https://beefy.finance/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Leveraged yield farming&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Basically you provide liquidity, while borrowing additional money to get more yield. You pay interest to lenders, but you earn more of the incentive tokens and fees. You put your money as collateral. Examples: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Alpaca: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://app.alpacafinance.org/farm&quot;&amp;gt;https://app.alpacafinance.org/farm&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Tulip: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://tulip.garden/leverage&quot;&amp;gt;https://tulip.garden/leverage&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Anchor+Mirror&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anchor protocol is one of the most favorite places to earn interest on stablecoins, with stable 19.5% its a no brainer. But you can get more when combining with Mirror protocol. This is covered in depth in many articles, so i am not going to repeat it: just google Anchor Mirror delta neutral strategy.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anchorprotocol.com/&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.anchorprotocol.com/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://mirrorprotocol.app&quot;&amp;gt;https://mirrorprotocol.app&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Anchor+MIM leverage&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Another thing people have been doing is basically leveraging your position. You borrow MIM against your aUST tokens (representing your deposit), sell MIM for UST, deposit again. I have never done this though, &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anchorprotocol.com/&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.anchorprotocol.com/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Nexus&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Next generation of these combined strategies is automated. Nexus Protocol is a great example: you deposit LUNA or ETH(PoS version) to nexus, it uses it as collateral in Anchor to borrow UST, deposits the UST to Anchor for additional yield, it monitors and maintains your LTV to ensure you are not liquidated, sell you profits for LUNA/ETH and it results in safer and higher yield. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Check it out: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://nexusprotocol.app/&quot;&amp;gt;https://nexusprotocol.app/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Moving funds between chains&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you are going the DeFi way, you may need to move funds between chains a lot. Especially valid for stablecoins and WBTC. Some tips to do this effectively:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Register on exchanges which support withdrawals and depostits to multiple chains: Binance, Bitfinex, Crypto. com - you can deposit with one chain, withdraw with other, usually paying some withdrawal fees&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;For swapping one stablecoin for another, use Binance rather than DEX, as fees are way lower. (if low cost is a priority, understandably for some of you priorites might be different, or you dont have binance available etc.)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Learn how to use multichain router: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://app.multichain.org/#/router&quot;&amp;gt;https://app.multichain.org/#/router&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; for cheap cross chain transfers&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;For larger amounts, avoid services which charge percentual fees&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Swapping to one crypto and than back for cross chain transafers is sometimes possible, but usually not very cheap and might trigger taxable event. Sometimes it might be only option though.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Ethereum bridges are usually the most expensive way to do this, unless you are handling very large amounts&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Some additional tips:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;If you just starting with few hundreds dollars, don&amp;amp;#39;t bother with DeFi. You will get crushed by blockchain fees. Use some CeFi lender with free withdrawals to accumulate, when you have more, you can start with DeFi. Also these CeFis will often give you nice sign-up bonuses, which will probably be worth a lot more than the interest, so be sure to get it. You can even jump between several CeFis to collect more of it. If still want to do DeFi, use a cheap chain. Harmony and Solana come to mind. Avoid Ethereum.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Don&amp;amp;#39;t get attached to a specific chain, good opportunities appear on different chains every time, it does not make sense to limit yourself to one favorite. Of course, if you are hodling SOL token, you will probably find best opportunities on Solana network, but with universal assets like stablecoins or BTC, it can be anywhere.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Always monitor your gains. If something doesn&amp;amp;#39;t add up, investigate and be prepared to move your funds.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Depending on your jurisdiction, you might have to pay taxes on your lending/staking/LP gains. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My favorite CeFi products:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Hodlnaut.com&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Ledn.io&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Celsius&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;FTX&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Less known, but very promising: Vauld&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My favorite DeFi products:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Anchor Protocol - note that Anchor Yield reserve is bleeding rapidly, its possible that yield will go down. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Tranquil.finance on Harmony (+Mimas clone from the same team on Cronos)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;TraderJoe on Avalanche&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Sovryn on RSK&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Internet was 14 years old in 1997 while BTC is 13 (?) years old this year.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;BTC users today: 130M&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Internet was 14 years old in 1997 while BTC is 13 (?) years old this year. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Looks like we&amp;amp;#39;re growing faster than internet did way back when but I know it&amp;amp;#39;s not all so black and white and there&amp;amp;#39;s many more factors at play here: technological literacy, avaliability of said technology, nearly 2 billion people more on the planet today compared to 1997 etc ...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Just felt like sharing this here and maybe starting a discussion since somebody mentioned the numbers Bitcoin sub.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

(I’m not gonna use it as my main source of income so don’t come at me) Anyways, Here are some of the games that I have found.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;1. Metawars&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
I don&amp;amp;#39;t think I&amp;amp;#39;m that early with this one. I was hoping for phase one, but I think this will be enough. I&amp;amp;#39;m hoping the graphics aren&amp;amp;#39;t too bad considering we will be exploring planets and battling other players. (It’s kinda like star atlas? lol) I’m wondering how much the planets will cost alsoooooo, it’s a multiplayer game which is kinda intriguing but still kinda skeptic about this.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;2. Wrejects&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
I’m looking forward to this one too. Wrestling and aliens are the perfect combination for me. Still thinking if the graphics when wrestling will be good. I’m really realllyyy looking forward to the gameplay but It’s still on Q1 so there’s nothing much info out there. Every fighter, like in other PVP games, has their own backstory and unique special move. Also, unlike in Metawars, the team is doxxed.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;3. My Neighbor Alice&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
Not early enough with this one too but this is a pretty wholesome game. It’s an open world game kinda like animal crossing? I wasn’t able to join the pre-alpha access but seeing the gameplay was enough for me. I can see myself spending hours playing this, just like I did with AC also, It’s on steam which is a plus for me.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Any thoughts about the games that I mentioned?&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
Ps. still new to this.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Biometrics and facial recognition in VR headsets or AR glasses will be used to authenticate users to a specific wallet address, guaranteeing that no user votes twice.

That’s just for the wedding. With the divorce rate steadily increasing, a marriage is the most risky, unfavorable investment one could make in his/her entire life. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then, let’s say you and your significant other decides to divorce. Attorney fees, and divorce filings can well exceed $10k (If you’re lucky) and that’s not even taking into account your significant other taking half of your shit + child support if you have children. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Society is programmed into thinking getting married and having children is happiness. Don’t get me wrong, of course there’s happiness and love involved, but almost 65% of men and women find out the hard way there is A LOT of financial suffering involved too. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In conclusion, investing in Crypto is a risk, but so is living the blueprint model of happiness and success. Investing in crypto seems a lot safer than getting married to one person for the rest of your life. I’m just saying.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They report, he is giving back to the community and &amp;amp;quot;A cryptocurrency he set up to support charity has already seen more than £200,000 spent on causes, and he is looking to use further funds raised by his currency to realise his foodbank plans for his home town of Birmingham.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I got the usual CB email saying they&amp;amp;#39;d received my deposit, and the tx is confirmed on etherscan.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The coins were never put into my portfolio.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I opened a support ticket, and got a vague non-answer by reply (we&amp;amp;#39;re looking into it). It was promptly closed without explanation. I have since opened another 3 tickets which have all been met with similar vague responses, and then the tickets are closed without explanation. My requests to make a complaint have been ignored. I posted on their subreddit 2 weeks ago and got another vague response, no DMs etc.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;ve posted there again today but don&amp;amp;#39;t expect much.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My account is not suspended etc., I am still able to transact with existing funds and deposit fiat. I tested this yesterday.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The funny thing is I trade high volume and had I continued using CBP, I would have paid them multiples of the value of this deposit in fees over the next 12 months. Congrats, you played yourselves.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I was able to live with CBP constantly going down during periods of volatility (sus AF!) but this is crossing the line.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;I am purely posting to encourage others to stay away from coinbase and CBP.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; I am not the first person this has happened to. There are literally hundreds of posts like mine on their support sub where people have had funds vanish and the support team just ignores them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Aside from this their fee structure sucks anyway. People seem think CBP is the cheapest for fees but they&amp;amp;#39;re only the cheapest if you trade over $100k per month. I only used them because it was a quick cash onramp from my Revolut account. I&amp;amp;#39;ll be sticking with Binance and Kraken from here on out.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Be careful where you leave your funds.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;EDIT: Lots of people doubting the legitimacy of my post which I guess is healthy skepticism. When I get home from work I will redact my personal details and edit in links to my (very one sided) correspondence with Coinbase.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;From this newspaper that is nationally distributed in Russia: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/5206307&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/5206307&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The government and the Bank of Russia have agreed on a future regime for the circulation of cryptocurrencies in Russia: before February 18, they will prepare a draft law on the circulation of digital currencies in the Russian Federation, in which cryptocurrencies are recognized as an analogue of currencies, and not digital financial assets (DFA). Their circulation in the legal sector will be possible only with full identification, through the banking system or licensed intermediaries. Operations equivalent to more than 600 thousand rubles must be declared, transactions outside the legal sector for such amounts will become a criminal offense and an aggravating circumstance under the Criminal Code, fines will be introduced for the illegal acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a means of payment. Mining and related issues of DFA are not affected by the concept within which the project is being prepared.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The government, after meetings with Deputy Prime Minister, Chief of Staff of the White House Dmitry Grigorenko, published the approved &amp;amp;quot;Concept for regulating the mechanisms for organizing the circulation of digital currencies.&amp;amp;quot; Recall that the White House has been discussing the new status of cryptocurrencies and digital currencies in the Russian Federation since the summer of 2021, in January 2021 a road map was created on this issue, the Bank of Russia made a consultative report proposing to ban the circulation of cryptocurrencies in the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Finance - with its own development on this topic. The final concept is mainly based on the positions of the Ministry of Finance.Until February 18, the ministry and the Bank of Russia must formulate either a separate bill or amendments to the law on the CFA and other laws for its implementation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The details of the &amp;amp;quot;transition period&amp;amp;quot;, as well as mining, are not discussed by the concept. Meanwhile, they are quite important: the regulation of turnover will require quick decisions from cryptocurrency owners - whether they should move into the emerging legal market segment, get rid of such assets, or stay in the illegal sector. The main difference between the concept, which, in fact, implements the Central Bank&amp;amp;#39;s strong distrust of cryptocurrency, is the proposal to develop amendments to the Criminal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure, according to which evasion of declaring transactions with cryptocurrency will become a criminal offense, and its use will become an aggravating circumstance in other offenses.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The possession of cryptocurrency in the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation and transactions with it (as well as with the dollar) are not prohibited - but only through the &amp;amp;quot;organizer of the digital currency exchange system&amp;amp;quot; (a bank with a universal license) or a p2p exchanger legalized in the Russian Federation. The mode of operation of the legal segment involves the full identification of the client according to banking rules, work taking into account AML / CFT requirements, all information about transactions through the Transparent Blockchain system of Rosfinmonitoring will be available for state control in the same way as transactions with non-cash rubles or foreign currency on bank accounts. The mode of control over transactions with the cryptocurrency of natural persons, however, is described by the concept as not too different from the mode of control over cash transactions with any currency. Most likely, the main argument “for” was that in the USA, the EU and Japan they are inclined to the same or to strict bans, as in China, which was also proposed by the Bank of Russia.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So far, the most intriguing is the organization of the legalization of the existing undeclared cryptocurrency, which is not described in the concept. Market participants have no doubts that the possibilities of working with &amp;amp;quot;legal crypto&amp;amp;quot; in the implementation of the concept are adequate. The same part of the owners who prefer to remain in the sector illegal for the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation depends on the future taxation of operations with cryptocurrencies (from the meaning of the concept it follows that it should not differ from the principles of holding foreign currency) and on the rules of legalization. The Ministry of Finance&amp;amp;#39;s estimate of the total amount of crypto assets in the Russian Federation has not changed - it is 12 million crypto wallets with assets worth 2 trillion rubles. It is decidedly unknown whether this figure takes into account the cryptocurrency used in the criminal sector, obviously.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

This is also more than just a simple nice-to-have feature. Imagine you browse websites that knowingly sell your I.P. address and other information to hackers and other malicious actors can openly see what you&amp;amp;#39;re doing and your physical location on a map. Isn&amp;amp;#39;t that dangerous? Don&amp;amp;#39;t our Anti-virus softwares and web browsers stop us from doing these things? Don&amp;amp;#39;t all windows machines have these installed by default?               &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It feels like this is one of those topics that 5 or 10 years down the road, none of us will be discussing because it&amp;amp;#39;s already been implemented for a long long time. If you guys used the first iterations of the internet where you had to memorize I.P. Addresses because there were no DNS names to get to some places online, then pretty much everyone here would agree that no one would use the internet of the late 80s and early 90s today if it were still the same way.                  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To the people who say, &amp;amp;quot;If you have lots of money in ETH or BTC and you are sending it to an address by mistake, it&amp;amp;#39;s your fuck up and you deserve to lose your money.&amp;amp;quot; You&amp;amp;#39;re missing the point completely. The point is that your antivirus warns you when you are about to make a massive mistake that could lead to something like ransomware, spyware, or trojans getting installed to your PC. I think it would be great to have Metamask fire off an audible warning and a message that says, &amp;amp;quot;The wallet address you are sending funds to is a known contract address and not a hot wallet. The funds you send will not be used by any human being and will be lost forever. Do you wish to continue?&amp;amp;quot; seems fine. Maybe stack it with, something like, &amp;amp;quot;This address is to a known wallet address of an Exchange that suffered a security breach and has ended service to their customers. The funds you send to this wallet address will likely be lost forever.&amp;amp;quot; Not bad...              &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But what if we have someone whose account on an exchange was terminated and then all of the exchanges got together and said, &amp;amp;quot;Let&amp;amp;#39;s make a database of irrecoverable wallet addresses where terminated / irretrievable 0x addresses exist so that users don&amp;amp;#39;t send funds to them by mistake, and let the people at Metamask know this as well.&amp;amp;quot; Sounds like an interesting value proposition.                  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Finally, by improving the way wallets function we are increasing adoption by eliminating one route where users can screw up simply by stopping them from making a mistake and making them double check an address they send funds to.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;                &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;And I almost forgot: To be clear, I am NOT advocating that wallets block transactions at all. If the user is fully aware of what they are doing, then the opus is on them.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sometimes, luck is when opportunity meets preparation. The opportunity of a lifetime has been in front of people for a months if not years now! Many people dismiss crypto because they don’t understand it. Instead of giving an hour of their time to begin learning about the problems that crypto solves.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Stop listening to good ol’ banks. They don’t care about you. Be aware, and have clear frame of mind.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Any advice here or is this just a lost cause? I know absolutely nothing about crypto besides surface level knowledge.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit - Rip DM’s&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I noticed that many people mentioned in the comments that they are only receiving 1 or 2 adds per hour.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If your Brave is updated you can navigate to Reward Settings (in the Brave Rewards window), and from there click on the icon on the right of Brave Private Ads. This will bring up a menu that lets you specify how many adds per hour you are limited do.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now, I don&amp;amp;#39;t know how it possible to get 12.25 BAT, but I was previously getting close to 1 with being locked to 5 ads per hour. Being locked to 10 should net you close to 2 or even 3 if you are browsing a lot.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Welcome!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
