There are a lot of other issues they could focus on that have a way larger impact on climate change than BTC. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Did you see the private jet fleet that flew all the billionaires to Davos? The same people telling you to eat bugs and ban mining are flying around on private jets. Private jet flights produce around 33.7 million metric tons of carbon dioxide a year. Whereas Bitcoin production is estimated to generate between 22 and 22.9 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions a year.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/3h2i3qriph491.png?width=1744&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=1945404b910c96980fda8c2695d4f676b1cf61b7&quot;&amp;gt;The actual fleet of jets at Davos 2022&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So all these people preaching about the impact of mining, better start rolling up on bicycles if they want us to listen. Get off your carbon emission-filled soap boxes, billionaires. In actuality, 100 companies have been the source of more than 70% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions since 1988.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

It&amp;amp;#39;s fascinating: according to her, 64 individuals controlled virtually all of the mining at that time, and they could easily have attacked the network, but chose not to.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This study raises questions about the decentralization of Bitcoin in its early years. We know that the community was much smaller back then, but it&amp;amp;#39;s impressive how tiny it was. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The scientist, Alyssa Blackburn, used &amp;amp;quot;leakage information&amp;amp;quot; to come up with this result. Here&amp;amp;#39;s how &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;The New York Times&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; reported her methods :&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Aggregating multiple leakages, Ms. Blackburn consolidated many Bitcoin addresses, which might have seemed to represent many miners, into few. She pieced together a catalog of agents and concluded that, in those first two years, 64 key players — some of whom were the community’s “founders,” as the researchers called them — mined most of the Bitcoin that existed at the time.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“What they figured out, just how concentrated early mining and use of Bitcoin was, that’s a scientific discovery,” said Eric Budish, an economist at the University of Chicago.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some might think this is bad news, but I disagree. For one thing, it proves that serious scientific researchers are interested in blockchain and its usefulness (by the way, Alyssa Blackburn herself says that she is cryptocurrency agnostic, and she says that her research can help make the network more decentralized).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It also shows how far we&amp;amp;#39;ve come since 2009. Today, it would be unthinkable that a single person - or a small group of people - could carry out a 51% attack against Bitcoin. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Finally, it proves that the early adopters cared about the health of the network.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Contrary to what no-coiners love to think, cryptocurrency and blockchain is a new and fascinating technology, and that study proves it. Real scientific progress is being achieved because of it. “The techniques used to extract information are interesting&amp;amp;quot;, said Jaron Lanier, a computer scientist. Studying blockchains lead to new techniques, which is a scientific progress.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What do you think about this discovery?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“I want to come clean, and I will likely tear a rift in the entire community while I&amp;amp;#39;m at it and on my way out.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Over the course of these next few weeks I will be releasing 137.21GB of Telegram group chats and messages, of which I was not a part of. Why? This is all thanks to an exploit in October of 2019 that allowed one to access the group page with recent messages if proper permissions were not set up. At the time of writing this, the team at Telegram have been contacted about this. I&amp;amp;#39;ve only ever seen two people mention this exploit in passing, one in person and one on Twitter, so I know I was not the only one.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Those who know me will know who I am very soon, for the rest of the populace it doesn&amp;amp;#39;t matter. Due to the overwhelming amount of messages, I formally invite reputable press within the community to reach out in order to obtain sample archives from groups I&amp;amp;#39;ve already curated. I will vet you because there is a conflict of interest as many are involved personally, whether being friends of those individuals in this archive or related financially in one way or another. You will receive the .7zip archive ahead of time but it will be password-protected until the 7th of July.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I have no further relationships with the people mentioned after this and will never be in contact with them in the future as of this moment.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Three years ago, a vulnerability on Telegram was discovered by a colleague of mine. He did not take it to its final outcome. By exploiting this, one could recreate an invite to view the overview page and recent messages of any Telegram group of an individual user without actually joining said group.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Between October of 2019 to May of 2022 I was collecting all messages as is in my data hoarding nature. I had written a script that downloads every message sent to any Telegram group with targetted individuals, you may know some of them as crypto influencers, while others targetted included many investors in the space. As Telegram adoption among crypto users began to grow, it began to become increasingly difficult to monitor all these group chats so I stepped away for a while and let the messages continue to download and be copied to my personal server.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For the most popular traders in the community, spying on them became a hobby. From personal events in their lives shared with their closest friend groups, to scams and rugpulls that were created on their way to success, financially and socially on Twitter. I felt like a part of it even though I had no method to interact with them. However, as they got rich, I got rich. I got myself into plenty of VC groups and soon my entire circle of friends and those I talked to became one and the same.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I did not care in the past, some of these people are looked up to in the ecosystem nowadays and the thought of these individuals commiting fraud would be dismissed in an instant. Some even moving on from their days of bygone scams under anonymous names with their groups of friends (while others continue to persist to this day).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Artists pretending to be developers, developers pretending to be artists. Those pretending to be rich, those pretending to be poor, pretending to be someone you&amp;amp;#39;re not. All of that was exposed to me. All of that was this community at its core when expressing themselves to the public, usually through Twitter.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I do not know what it is about Telegram, but the alleged assurance of privacy and security meant that people became relaxed and let them express themselves freely.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It doesn&amp;amp;#39;t matter to me anymore. I am dying from illnesses that are wreaking havoc on my body. Any money I made will just go on to my family, and I will disappear after that.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But not before this feeling of guilt is released from me.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Many of the individuals or projects I name will not survive this, either due to public backlash, financial fraud, or other obscure reasons such as embarrassment. Some may step down from their positions of power, others will likely ignore it as they can&amp;amp;#39;t claim the messages that are archvied are fraudulent unless everyone involved in the group chats are all on the same page.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There will be confusion, there will be sadness, there will be anger and there will be frustration. I am intrigued to see what happens next but I let everyone else decide how to proceed forward.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;June 15th will publish excerpts from:
- crypto influencers, ranging from as little as 800 followers to as much as 1M followers
- discussions pertaining to racism and homophobia, of adultery and sexual assault on members of the public and those within the crypto communities 
- those with 8-9 figures and high amounts of Twitter followers discussing rugpull projects, projects intended to scam the community and individuals, dating between Dec 2019 - Feb 2022
- killing and stealing the crypto of an individual with a group of friends (coordinated through telegram)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;June 30th:

- discussions of everything included from the crypto influencers
- invitation to orgies on private jets, in mansions, in VR settings, orgies everywhere

In a recurring pattern, as published by Reuters investigation report, Binance has helped launder money originating from scams, hacks, investment frauds, illegal drug sales, a foreign exchange violation case among others in the last five years. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The U.S.  government also hired crypto researcher Chainalysis,  to monitor illegal flows, and it was reported that Binance received criminal funds totaling $770 million in 2019 alone, another report by Crystal Blockchain,  showed that a Russian-language site called Hydra, used Binance to make and receive crypto payments worth $780 million.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Reuters calculated from an examination of court records, statements by law enforcement and blockchain data, compiled for the news agency by two blockchain analysis firms. Two industry experts reviewed the calculation and agreed with the estimate.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Binance declined to make Zhao available for an interview. Responding to written questions, Chief Communications Officer Patrick Hillmann said Binance did not consider Reuters’ calculation to be accurate. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;He did not respond to requests to provide Binance’s own figures for the cases identified in this article.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; He said Binance was building “the most sophisticated cyber forensics team on the planet” and was seeking to “further improve our ability to detect illegal crypto activity on our platform.” &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What impact do you think this will have on Binance and its&amp;amp;#39; Binance Coin&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I found that the same shop is now selling everything at almost double the price now compared to last few weeks. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I have been hearing about inflation and was aware of price increases (since I don&amp;amp;#39;t have a car, living in a big metro I was not directly impacted) but today was my real experience with these price increases in such a short span of time. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I have exposed and hedged myself from this with BTC but I feel it is not enough now.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I know I can still afford and be able to pay these prices. But I am so worried and sad that the poor sections of the society will basically find themselves not being able to buy anything if this continues like this. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is just sad. Very sad. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I try to bring awareness around me to why this is happening but all the people seems to not understand basic finance and there anger is directed towards government to provide help, give them more money as aid. This is the very problem &amp;amp;#39;more money&amp;amp;#39; which is equivalent to &amp;amp;#39;printer going brrrr&amp;amp;#39; -root cause of all problems. It almost seems we are in this death spiral and our generation will see worst of worst times in coming years. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I try to find optimism in pessimistic times in life but for the first time I feel there is only pessimism ahead of us. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My only hope is this project &amp;amp;quot;BTC&amp;amp;quot;. Only hope!!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: Nothing against any country or continent, but I am not from North America. Inflation is a global problem but when I read comments it is becoming too focused on US politics and to be honest I don&amp;amp;#39;t get the local references in your comments!!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
