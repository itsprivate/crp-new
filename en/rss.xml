Was it an airdrop that you forgot about and found years later?How long did you hold it in your portfolio and what made you take profits at the time that you did? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Obviously the folks who have been in for years and years will have a story about buying BTC or ETH at a crazy price. For those people, I’m most interested in what made you take profits at the time that you did? Hopefully it was for something positive and not a case where you needed the money for an emergency. If you didn’t &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;need&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; the money, did you just not want to tempt fate any longer and you already had made a 10-15x?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What allowed you to HODL through the dips and crashes and how did you achieve your conviction in the project? Was it blind optimism? Did you actually DYOR and nobody could convince you that you were wrong? Or was it pure luck and you bought on a whim and it rocketed up so fast you just rode the quick wave, took the money and ran? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Let’s hear it folks!!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yes BTC won&amp;amp;#39;t bring you a 100* nor will ETH but they are a promise of good returns. Heck even if you are chasing some *1000 you should still invest in ETH and BTC because they allow you to hedge your bet. If you lose your crazy risky investment you&amp;amp;#39;d still have ETH and BTC working for you. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I know crypto can give you outrageous returns but we shouldn&amp;amp;#39;t spit on some +50%. I really think, one day, BTC will be 100K usd and ETH will be 10K usd. These are more than solid gains. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Another reason you should invest in these two coins is that they drive the market. When BTC rises the rest of your portfolio rises. Investing in BTC is currently investing in crypto as whole. Reinforcing the market and making all your subsequent bets more secure. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I think you&amp;amp;#39;d have to be a mad person or to be very good at DYORing to not invest in BTC and ETH. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Not financial advice obviously. You do you. Take your risks like adults.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto is much much better. I&amp;amp;#39;m getting double digit interest rates, huge annual return due to Crypto&amp;amp;#39;s value rising PLUS a hedge against inflation. Moreover, there&amp;amp;#39;s no privacy concern and the utility is the same or even more than banks considering Crypto is being accepted more and more as a payment method with better discounts than bank credit cards.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cosmos ecosystem and why it is the most important/undervalued aspect to the crypto space..&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Look into the cosmos ecosystem&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It’s simply fucking beautiful. So beautiful you can’t even fathom it. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Many of the top 15 projects were built off Cosmos SDK! Binance, CRO, LUNA, and many more. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cosmos SDK is one of the best in the crypto space. Tendermint and cosmos are all community driven! No VC’s involved. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Interchain security&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Interchain staking&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;ETH bridge&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Liquid staking&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All coming Q1 2022&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Gas fees? How about no. Decentralized? Yeah we like that shit. Defi? Yeah we have it. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now let’s get into the ecosystem. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Starting off&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;…&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You have Secret &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;SCRT&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://scrt.network/&quot;&amp;gt;https://scrt.network/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Secret Network is the first blockchain with data privacy by default, allowing you to build and use applications that are both permissionless and privacy-preserving. This unique functionality protects users, secures applications, and unlocks hundreds of never-before-possible use cases for Web3.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Tired of companies selling your data for their profit&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yeah so are we. Look no further. This is what will be the most important aspect to web3.0. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Osmosis&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Osmo&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://osmosis.zone/&quot;&amp;gt;https://osmosis.zone/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;First interoperable DEX. I don’t believe anything else needs to be said. Low fees every exchange/swap. Pools with fantastic APY’s. &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;The whole nine yards&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can also look into Cosmos Gravity DEX. Which will also give back all fees accumulated through swaps, back to ATOM stake holders. Fucking beautiful. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Juno&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;JUNO&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://junochain.com/&quot;&amp;gt;https://junochain.com/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The cool thing about Juno besides that it’s interoperable smart contract platform, is that it was directly dropped to the community. 97% straight to atom stakers. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Devs tokens are locked for 12 years. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Juno will also become deflationary over a 12 year span.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Every year inflation is cut in half. “Halving” until no more coins are added to circulating supply. Then it becomes supply and demand similar to BTC.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The max supply is also capped at 185 million. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Juno is an interoperable smart contract network. Highly scalable, robust, secure and easy to deploy!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Many ATOM stakers have received coins through a February snap shot airdrop. All community driven! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Over 150% native apy! &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Defi&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; yes we love it here at the Cosmos ecosystem. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can code with rust and golang. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Whos excited for NETA!&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All of us early adopters will be truly rewarded. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All in all, the cosmos ecosystem is the best out there. Many cannot even fathom it’s future and this is why they don’t really rely on marketing to get their product out there….&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;cough cough&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;cardano&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. (Just a joke) Let the tech speak for itself. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But anyways not trying to throw shade at any project. Just bring light to this gem of a block chain. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Research cosmos and see how powerful the ecosystem is!  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;You can see the whole ecosystem in action through IBC transfers here as well as all other chains in the ecosystem&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; - &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://mapofzones.com/?testnet=false&amp;amp;amp;amp;period=24&amp;amp;amp;amp;tableOrderBy=totalIbcTxs&amp;amp;amp;amp;tableOrderSort=desc&quot;&amp;gt;https://mapofzones.com/?testnet=false&amp;amp;amp;amp;period=24&amp;amp;amp;amp;tableOrderBy=totalIbcTxs&amp;amp;amp;amp;tableOrderSort=desc&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These are just the top 3 in my opinion. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://cosmos.network/&quot;&amp;gt;https://cosmos.network/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One of my favorite quotes is…&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;”Atom is an IQ test”&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Tl;Dr&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cosmos is the most underrated block chain out there. You’re all made up of atoms. Let atom make up you.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The world can just be an absolutely awful, awful place.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I read these &amp;amp;quot;stolen or hacked crypto&amp;amp;quot; posts all the time. I always think, wow that person doesn&amp;amp;#39;t know what they&amp;amp;#39;re doing, shouldn&amp;amp;#39;t be investing in crypto in the first place, or that would never happen to me, because I&amp;amp;#39;m super careful! Maybe they are just lying and trying to just get sympathy? Believe me, I wish I was.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Although, the posts that seem legit I always try to help. Now, I am on the other side of it. Never thought I&amp;amp;#39;d be here.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;ve been investing in digital assets since early 2016. I would consider myself pretty knowledgeable on all things related crypto/blockchain. I believe in the tech, I built my portfolio up for years and this is pretty much the only thing I enjoy in life.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I have a hardware wallet (Ledger Nano S) since 2017 and 4 different Metamask &amp;amp;quot;hot&amp;amp;quot; wallets. The hardware wallet consisted of 80% of my portfolio.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yesterday, I used my Metamask to access all my wallets for a balance status check before the new year. Everything seemed normal. After checking again late last night and after seeing one of my accounts showing as zero, I noticed every wallet was wiped.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My only possible conclusion is that I clicked a malicious link while surfing the internet. The trojan must have somehow took control over my Google Chrome browser (or Metamask extension) while I was using it, while my ledger was unlocked. Checking the transactions times they were sent out around the time I had it open. Again, I never was prompted to accept or approve anything that I myself wasn&amp;amp;#39;t doing. It is frightening.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As I look at all of my wallets today, I see zero balances and I am absolutely crushed. It took all my power to even get out of bed, file reports, and write this post today.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I filed a report with my local county police department and the FBI. Although, I doubt either will be of any help, unfortunately.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Checking the transactions, it seems like the wallets were completed wiped in a matter of minutes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hacker&amp;amp;#39;s ETH address:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;0x365DB2B5722d13F431224066898b4CF8cA7AdFe5&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Address on all chains:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://blockscan.com/address/0x365DB2B5722d13F431224066898b4CF8cA7AdFe5&quot;&amp;gt;https://blockscan.com/address/0x365DB2B5722d13F431224066898b4CF8cA7AdFe5&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m hoping one of the wallets leads to a KYC connection, but obviously a long shot here. Super grateful for any research or help.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some of the crypto that was stolen:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;$ETH $MATIC $AAVE $TIME $OVR $ENS $ZRX $AVAX&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If the hot wallets were all hacked, it would not be the end of the world. I just don&amp;amp;#39;t understand how the hacker accessed my hardware wallet, too. Again, I was never prompted a transaction to approve. My seed phrase is on paper, stored in a safe, which no one has access to. My seed phrase has never been written down anywhere else, no computer, no phone, except on that paper in the safe.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I know since it&amp;amp;#39;s self custody, it&amp;amp;#39;s obviously still my fault. Aside from probably accidently clicking a malicious link on the internet somewhere, I&amp;amp;#39;m still at a complete loss of what I could have done better. A possible solution was to maybe have the hardware wallet on a computer I never touched - one that I never used the internet for, but this is all in hindsight.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;ve been on this computer for years and there&amp;amp;#39;s been a few times when accidently clicking something that starts an auto-download. Obviously, I am always quick to delete or disable those files. Maybe a virus file was lying dormant for months or years without my anti-virus catching it? Just waiting for the right opportunity? Maybe it is a Metamask data leak? I&amp;amp;#39;m not sure. I like to think I&amp;amp;#39;m pretty careful about my passwords and security.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I mainly write this post to warn others. Even if you think you are safe, you might still be at risk. I guess with these advanced hackers now, all it takes is one wrong click. This was my life savings aside from a few emergency funds in my traditional bank. I don&amp;amp;#39;t think I will ever financially, emotionally, or mentally recover from this. It has affected my life and my family tremendously. I hate to sound dramatic and be that guy, but I&amp;amp;#39;m honestly at a point now where life doesn&amp;amp;#39;t even seem worth it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m trying my best to use the last of my energy to fight back.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Any help at all is super, super appreciated and I hope one day to pay you back tenfold (when I can).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thank you.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;---&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TL;DR ledger nano s hardware wallet and Metamask hot wallets were all hacked. Did everything in my power to keep my crypto safe and still lost everything. Most likely from a miss click link -&amp;amp;gt; file download somewhere? Not entirely sure. My life savings gone. I am absolutely crushed beyond belief. Happy new year, this is the worst day of my life.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;---  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;UPDATE: Many have reached out and experienced a similar hack, multiple with hardware wallets too. So many others have messaged to try to help and I can’t thank you all enough. Doing my best to respond while working with exchanges, law enforcement, etc. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I haven’t slept and working around the clock to try to bring justice to this. This is potentially huge and I don’t want others facing the same fate.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Can’t comment on much right now but a computer forensics expert is looking at my computer. Learned so far of a new malware that can hack into many of different crypto wallets. Yes, seems like Ledgers too. Potentially promising.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Compiling a comprehensive report when I can.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I gave this a lot of thought and for me that word would be: &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;STAKING&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In 2021 I decided to finally put my money to work. Why should I be the only one working and my money is laying around? Staking is what really made the biggest impression on me this year. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Red day after day, small gain, then large drop, small recovery, then another drop. I understand. We here are all experiencing it together. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But remember, this sub is an echochamber that makes crypto appear that adoption is almost ubiquitous. It&amp;amp;#39;s not. Most of the planet is still not in crypto. Most think its still a scam,or scary, or for criminals, or a bubble, or a Ponzi, or just plain useless. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The fact that you are here now, even in 2022, you are still one of the earliest adopters. Whether you are up 100k, or down 40%, in a few years it simply won&amp;amp;#39;t matter. We will all be massively up. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;By the year 2030, the same people that think you&amp;amp;#39;re an idiot will say:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;I can&amp;amp;#39;t believe you bought when it was less than 60k! You are so insanely lucky!&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We&amp;amp;#39;re along for the ride at the moment, and most of the planet is still queued up at the Hotdog stand paying with their FIAT. They&amp;amp;#39;ll join us on the ride eventually, but they still think its far too risky, and not worth giving up their current lifestyle choices. Meanwhile, we&amp;amp;#39;re having the time of our lives seeing a never ending unpredictable path of turns, drops, climbs, twists, rises and falls. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So, we can call each other dumb for backing X coin, being a maxi, or not diversifying, or forgetting to DCA, but in the end it doesn&amp;amp;#39;t matter. Crypto is inevitable, and will change the world, and most people still don&amp;amp;#39;t even realise that. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You are one lucky bastard.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Given the rise of p2e gaming, and retail interest in this area, it makes sense that there may well be growth in these kind of scaling solutions at a more sustained rate.  No noobs are gonna shell out thousands for gas just to play an 8 bit style game masquerading as a dex … even Defi Kingdoms has a high price entry point (shelling out for heroes) which newbies to the space will shy away from, although of course Harmony’s tx fees are of course wayyyyy better than ETH.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyway:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;zkSync looks interesting, as does zkSwap as a dex … anyone know much about Polygon Miden?  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I have got a bag of LRC as a starting point - shill me your favs and why.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto has taken a lot from me mentally, physically, and emotionally for the whole year. It&amp;amp;#39;s been a roller coaster. I&amp;amp;#39;ve lost a lot and I&amp;amp;#39;ve gained a lot, both only on papers. Should have would have could have, all these regrets piling up day by day has exhausted me.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Maybe it&amp;amp;#39;s time to take a break. Maybe it&amp;amp;#39;s time to recuperate from all of this.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So I&amp;amp;#39;ve decided. It&amp;amp;#39;s definitely time to take a looooooooooooooong break from everything. From the charts, from this sub, from any crypto news, I&amp;amp;#39;ll be uninstalling all my exchange apps as well, so that when I come back everything would be fresh.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;ll be living without fear for my investment, cause I trust the projects I put my money into.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I get that this is probably an oversimplification and I probably shouldn’t believe everything I read. I also understand that private keys are hard to guess by brute force but hear me out. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I have backed up all my wallet’s seed phrases and the wallets I‘ve accumulated are a handful. It is easy to restore an existing wallet using a backed up seed phrase. But wouldn’t it be possible to guess a random seed phrase? Seed phrases after all consist of 12 (or 24) words. Wouldn’t it be reasonable to find an existing seed phrase by trying word combinations by chance? Or am I not understanding an aspect of wallets or seed phrases?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I was just wondering and I’d love for someone to give a statistical or technical breakdown of why I might be right or wrong. Or just add your shitpost to farm karma and moons.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Don’t ever give up your seed phrase and don’t be greedy. If it’s too good to be true then it’s not true.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Ethereum does the opposite for me as I have to worry about losing tons of my precious ETH every time I want to use it. And you can completely forget about small transactions on it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The portfolio will be made of 7 coins chosen by me + 1 coin chosen by you.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is my plan for the moment but I&amp;amp;#39;m open to suggestions and tips on one coin from you:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;BTC: will be the first and most obvious choice. We all know why Bitcoin is the blue chip of cryptos, our digital gold. Let&amp;amp;#39;s go next.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;ETH: yes, I&amp;amp;#39;m an Ethereum lover, the eth2.0 transition with the POS, the incoming changes to delete the insane gas fees, the burn, web3.0, NFTs on OpenSea, even the news on Sushi, all these things make me bullish on ETH, flippening or not. ETH and BTC will compose the 50% of the portfolio, the remaining 50% will be share among the following 4 cryptos plus one proposed by you.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;LUNA: I fell in love with the idea behind Luna and Terra. It&amp;amp;#39;s probably a blue chip here to stay. The protocols Anchor, Mirror, Swap, Terra powered by UST are spectacular imho. For those who don&amp;amp;#39;t know, UST is an algorithmic stablecoin pegged to the value of the US dollar. What does this mean? Simply that if you want to mint 1 dollar of UST you have to burn 1 dollar of Luna. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;ALGO: won&amp;amp;#39;t say much about ALGO, if you&amp;amp;#39;re here then you probably already know it, it&amp;amp;#39;s almost everywhere in the daily. Algorand is a blockchain still in it&amp;amp;#39;s infancy, but with a wonderful and simple wallet, a great idea (god I love governance so much) and some nice new projects like Yieldly, a DeFi platform entirely developed on Algorand. Algo is decentalized, fast and secure and sustainable. Yep, the other great thing is the fact that Algorand is carbon negative, you can have more information on this topic on Algo&amp;amp;#39;s website. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;CRO: I&amp;amp;#39;m not gonna lie, I was impressed by cdc marketing this year, the insane amount of partnerships (Formula1, Serie A, naming rights on the Lakers arena, Philadelphia 76ers and so on), but they did not stop here: Visa card with cashback and free spotify/netflix, the cdc defi wallet where you can earn up to 13% on staked CROs, even the billions of cro burned are something I liked. Now they created Cronos and are aiming to &amp;amp;quot;scale the DeFi and decentralised application ecosystem, by providing developers with the ability to instantly port apps from Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains&amp;amp;quot;. A few projects can already be seen, like Tectonic. They are takin the NFTs market too, with some nice partnerships. For these reason I&amp;amp;#39;m going to keep dcaing CRO in 2022&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;ATOM: Last but not least. The internet of blockchains. Interoperability will be a fundamental topic imo in 2022 and beyond. I think there will be 10/15 big cryptos that will need to be interconnected, and that&amp;amp;#39;s what Cosmos wants to do. Like they say thei aim is &amp;amp;quot;to make it easy for developers to build blockchains and break the barriers between blockchains by allowing them to transact with each other. The end goal is to create an Internet of Blockchains, a network of blockchains able to communicate with each other in a decentralized way. With Cosmos, blockchains can maintain sovereignty, process transactions quickly and communicate with other blockchains in the ecosystem, making it optimal for a variety of use cases&amp;amp;quot;. They probably need to fix Atom tokenomic, but apart from that, the project is sweet. In the last month a lot of airdrops have been given to atom holders, making my bag heavier and keeping me in. And speaking about the price the good thing is that at the moment Atom is blocked under a strong resistance, but after that it&amp;amp;#39;s probably a stairway to heaven. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;CRV and CVX: Curve is a decentralized exchange optimized for low slippage and low fee swaps between assets pegged to the same value. It&amp;amp;#39;s an automated market maker that operates similarly to Balancer, relying on liquidity pools and rewarding those who fund the pools, except it only deals with stablecoins, that&amp;amp;#39;s the most simple explanation I can give you (words from Gemini site). Basically Curve is becoming more and more important in DeFi thanks to its ability to provide stablecoin liquidity across the ecosystem while offering token holders a less risky way to earn yield. Why I like this so much? Because we&amp;amp;#39;re dealing with stablecoins, this means that both in a bull and in a bear markets CRV will stay here and generate profits, because the demand for stablecoin liquidity doesn&amp;amp;#39;t care of a market up or down. There is a lot to say about Curve, the Curve war and so on (CVX and Yearn I&amp;amp;#39;m talking to you), but this would take way too much time and you can find news on internet if interested.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For the moment that&amp;amp;#39;s it, these will be the cryptos I&amp;amp;#39;ll DCA in 2022. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you have some tips I&amp;amp;#39;ll be happy to read all of them. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now, given that I already have a bag of LRC, MATIC, DOT, what coin should I add? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m going to do a little experiment and pick one among the most upvoted answers, there is one rule: no shitcoins and no coins I already wrote. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When proposing the coin please tell me why should I add it and if you will DCA it or not in 2022.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That&amp;amp;#39;s it guys. Took a lot of time lol, hope you appreciate and this post can be useful to some of you. Remember to DYOR!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I understand that the management of USDT doesn&amp;amp;#39;t require the same sort of oversight as, say, a real estate firm, but this AUM per employee is still astronomical and alarming.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Tl;dr Don&amp;amp;#39;t use Tether&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;*It says that there are 25 employees, however a lot of these are &amp;amp;quot;investors in Tether&amp;amp;quot;, or just entirely not related to the company. There are 18 who look like they actually work at Tether and I think that&amp;amp;#39;s generous.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
