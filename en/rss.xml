Users can earn BAT by viewing these ads, and Brave keeps a cut (30%) to run their operations. This process has been steadily regressing, with more and more issues this month and seems to be capitulating.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://community.brave.com/c/brave-rewards/71&quot;&amp;gt;https://community.brave.com/c/brave-rewards/71&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Their community forum is full of people experiencing Brave&amp;amp;#39;s terrible payout system. Basically, Brave tells you you&amp;amp;#39;ll get paid the 5-7th, but that isn&amp;amp;#39;t happening. Your rewards seem to disappear, and then you hope one day you get paid. The Brave Team seems to expect their millions of users to individually PM them to get it resolved on a wallet-by wallet basis, and as you can imagine, they aren&amp;amp;#39;t able to keep up. Now they&amp;amp;#39;re rolling people&amp;amp;#39;s rewards over to the next month, essentially just holding people&amp;amp;#39;s money until they look into it more.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bravebat.info/brave_initiated_bat_purchase&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.bravebat.info/brave_initiated_bat_purchase&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
Brave touts 54 million active monthly users, but has failed to convert those numbers into revenue. The link above shows that for 54MM users, they&amp;amp;#39;ve never done more than $3MM in monthly BAT sales, which they only keep 30% of. This is pennies a month per user, and means that Brave is massively cash flow negative, as they claim hundreds of employees. They have completely failed to effectively monetize their massive user base, and now we&amp;amp;#39;re seeing they&amp;amp;#39;re completely in over their head.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you head over to &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/batproject&quot;&amp;gt;r/batproject&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, you&amp;amp;#39;ll see that the Brave Team has stopped engaging their users, unless they have a very canned response. Their &amp;amp;quot;Director of Engagement&amp;amp;quot; posts very rarely, and they refuse to respond to questions of users. The red flags are adding up, and my guess is that Brave is failing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Investing in BAT I&amp;amp;#39;m realizing is like investing in a private company, and is actually a regressive way to invest. They don&amp;amp;#39;t disclose their runrate, revenue, all revenue sources, executive compensation and many other key metrics that you can see at any publicly traded company. However, Brave touts &amp;amp;quot;transparency&amp;amp;quot; every chance they get, while being about as transparent as milk when it comes to any issues with the payouts.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Perhaps the most damming metric is the 0 growth in ad campaigns in the US. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bravebat.info/brave_ads_campaigns?country=United%20States&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.bravebat.info/brave_ads_campaigns?country=United%20States&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Shows 2 years of flat US ad campaigns, so US advertisers don&amp;amp;#39;t want this. plenty of big names have come through, and very few of run repeat campaigns. If you use the browser, the ads you&amp;amp;#39;ll get now are from very low quality companies, similar to when the browser first started.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I think it&amp;amp;#39;s clear that BAT is failing. Most people on here get maybe a couple of quarters a month, after being told how valuable their data is. Most people think the rewards are a complete joke on here, and I guess they are, and the team&amp;amp;#39;s response is certainly telling of a team in complete disarray. The idea of privacy browser that compensates you for your ad viewing is brilliant, but this team&amp;amp;#39;s execution of that concept ain&amp;amp;#39;t it. It&amp;amp;#39;s been years, they won&amp;amp;#39;t talk about what&amp;amp;#39;s going on, and it&amp;amp;#39;s getting worse. Take a look through that first link, it&amp;amp;#39;s not good.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These issues have gotten worse over the years, and clearly Brave isn&amp;amp;#39;t going to be &amp;amp;quot;transparent&amp;amp;quot; about the problem. I would advise any investors to assume that if the team won&amp;amp;#39;t answer their questions, it&amp;amp;#39;s because the answer is really bad. The Brave Team won&amp;amp;#39;t answer these questions on &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/batproject&quot;&amp;gt;r/batproject&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; - go take a look, they&amp;amp;#39;ve been asked for years, the team will engage and then ghost any question they don&amp;amp;#39;t like.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

In this thread, I will share my experience on the perfect breakdown. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To start, you want at least 70% in BTC. This is the granddaddy of all coins and your most stable. The higher the percentage of BTC, the better.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Next is ETH, I’ve found 60% is a good level. Even if you just have BTC and ETH, you will have 130% of your portfolio in 2 coins, up for 100% you started with. To instantly have 30% more, you are genius. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Next up is the large-cap alts. I like 30% here. You can LRDYOR (let Redditors do your own research) to decide which coin is best for you, but possible examples are SOL, ADA, DOT, LINK, AVAX, etc. Following advice up to this point, you have at least 160% portfolio. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Keeping 20% stables is key to any portfolio. You can earn interest (up to 20%) on stables, plus any price action. I saw one tik-tok’er predict Tether would go to $5 this year. I think that’s bullish, but I can easily see USDT going to $3. Let’s say you earn 20% interest on your 20% investment, you now have 40% (compounding interest works wonders). Now your portfolio allocation is at 200% and you have doubled your money. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now that you have doubled your money, going for 100% portfolio allocation to 200%, you have freedom to gamble on low cap coins. I’d keep this to 10%. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This strategy will work for everyone. It will instantly turn you into a billionaire overnight. Follow me for more financial advice.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now imagine you want to leave Russia and bring money with you. You don&amp;amp;#39;t want to hold Rubles because they&amp;amp;#39;re losing value by the second. You can&amp;amp;#39;t hold foreign currency. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How do you bring money with you? Crypto. You buy lots of BTC and ETH, store your wallet keys safely, and leave the country with no one any the wiser. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Russians will use crypto to get out of the hellhole that is Russia and start a new life, now that they can&amp;amp;#39;t use foreign currencies to do it.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Former US presidential candidate – Hillary Clinton – criticized those cryptocurrency trading venues that refused to stop servicing Russian-based users. She once again opined that digital assets should be put under a regulatory framework.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Amidst the Russian invasion in Ukraine, Mykhailo Fedorov – the latter’s Vice Prime Minister – asked the leading digital asset platforms to freeze all Russian users’ blockchain addresses. According to the politician, the move would weaken Russia and aid Ukraine’s defense.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In a recent interview for MSNBC, the former first lady Hillary Clinton said she is “disappointed” that some cryptocurrency exchanges still provide services to such users:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Why do these people talk about thinga they have not a single inkling about? And clearly any sort of decentralization is poisoni their eyes&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;YES, they actually tripled it.   Turns out the previous mayor didn&amp;amp;#39;t pay the water bill from the other city we get water from for like 8 years!.    Great that I have to pay for the previous home owner&amp;amp;#39;s water bill.  Why not right?    But the absolute worst thing about what we are going through right now is the idea that &amp;amp;quot;crypto is the problem&amp;amp;quot; and it&amp;amp;#39;s being used as one of the scape goats in the Ukraine/Russia war.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/acyupa6vrsk81.jpg?width=1184&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=1402d66b989ee6048bec4f4ed100fe1a8bc28a17&quot;&amp;gt;Cryptocurrencies risk undermining sanctions against Russia, allowing Putin and his cronies to evade economic pain.  &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Except this is not whats happening, and on the contrary its Ukraine thats using crypto for good. Yet none of these Senators celebrate crypto for what its actually being used for, but instead create a non-story to serve their vested interests of slamming crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How pathetic could all of this get? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;She just wants an opportunity to somehow link it to hit out against crypto. Using her public and visible position to spread her own agenda when the country thats most affected by whats going on is actually  using crypto for the betterment of its people in the present terrible situation. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/wqgx98gwssk81.jpg?width=1198&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=699dcd94d491efbe6d57968d1606ba9cbd1aea67&quot;&amp;gt;Infact, just now Ukraine took up on Gavin Wood&amp;amp;#39;s generous offer too. &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And was able to find a bit of humor even in circumstances such as now..&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: There are of course a possibility that this could happen, but as of now there is no evidence that it is happening. Nor is it likely in the future, infact Russia is more likely to use China&amp;amp;#39;s SWIFT replacement known as CIPS - Cross-Border Interbank Payment System, or use their own SWIFT replacement SPFS (less likely as low liquidity).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPFS&quot;&amp;gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPFS&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; - Russian Central Bank has already said SPFS could be an option, and 23 countries foreign banks are already connected to it. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;USA is already the largest liquid crypto markets, if Russia starts accepting crypto for their strategically important export oil, they wont have any places to spend their crypto as the liquid USD-crypto market is already closed for them. Whats the point of earning say 10,000 crypto coins for a million barrels of oil, if they cant spend it anywhere due to lack of counterparties willing to trade with them? Russian Ruble - crypto pairs are non-existent today. Also, they cant use that crypto to buy commodities from other countries either, as these countries could come under risk of sanction themselves, and furthermore high volume crypto-commodity market is also non-existent right now. No country is going to be ready to start accepting say 10m  tonnes of Wheat for Crypto. Such a scenario is not even possible right now given the structure of crypto markets.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The article mostly talks about how Bitcoin is a huge pump and dump scheme and you know how it&amp;amp;#39;s a scam.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;I’m tired of saying, “Be careful, it’s speculative.” Then, “Be careful, it’s gambling.” Then, “Be careful, it’s a bubble.” Okay, I’ll say it: Bitcoin is a scam.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Followed by&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Bitcoins are accepted almost nowhere, and some cryptocurrencies nowhere at all.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Well we have seen how it turned out to be with global adoption very close and crypto helping a crisis in the world right now.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But what is interesting is another Vox&amp;amp;#39;s  article years later &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/recode/22383757/bitcoin-coinbase-ipo-crypto-ethereum-cryptocurrency&quot;&amp;gt;Like it or not, you should probably start paying attention to bitcoin&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s mostly a Coin base shill but it proves  how awfully wrong and manipulative media can be.  Being updated with  crypto news could be helpful but it mostly fucks up your investment because of the constant confusion.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The best thing to do would be to consider media as entertainment and never to take any financial decision because of it. Especially Panic selling or fomoing no matter what the experts&amp;amp;quot; say.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Stick to your plan without getting manipulated into selling or buying because of news.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;50% down from a $1000 investment leaves you at $500. If the market goes up 50% again you&amp;amp;#39;ll have $750, not $1000 (50% of $500 is $250)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To get back to the initial $1000, your coin would have to jump by 100% from $500, which is a much longer journey than just 50%&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So even though we had a massive 15% BTC rally today, the 15% drop we had recently still feels much heavier. Sure, things will probably go back up to where they were, but just a friendly reminder that the market is not as symmetric as it looks like&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

After sanctions and severe economic restrictions placed on the nation and it&amp;amp;#39;s inhabitants by the rest of the world due to the invasion of Ukraine, crypto is pumping, and BTC alone is up 13% or so. On top of that, it&amp;amp;#39;s likely that a smaller percentage of that population are the ones buying given current worldwide so really the movement happened with a small percentage of that population amount. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If this event can cause this amount price of an increase, what happens when a global population of a little under 8 BILLION decides to adopt BTC as a hedge against uncertainty and war or simply as a means to transact with minimal fees in a transparent and decentralized way? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here is a hopium induced thought, what if the change in BTC price today was true and held a similar linear relationship with each approximate 2% increase in adoption (measured by the corresponding increase in % of world population)? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Alright, so I gave this simple model a try. I increased world population at 2%. I then found a multiplication factor by dividing the increase in BTC price by the percentage of the population that adopted today presumably and just assumed that would hold true for each 2% adoption. I then carried that out through 2% intervals until we got close to full world adoption and found a value for BTC assuming a spot price of $43,000.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/0zoq5m72yok81.png?width=1500&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=a7075db314300dc435d6679ed7a64f6bf4373ef3&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/0zoq5m72yok81.png?width=1500&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=a7075db314300dc435d6679ed7a64f6bf4373ef3&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;d say there is a pretty bright future as seen above and this is with an extremely limited/rudimentary model with lot&amp;amp;#39;s of assumptions. I think that answer is conservative because of halving, significant future inflation, and other factors of demand and BTC&amp;amp;#39;s scarce supply. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They&amp;amp;#39;ve since DCA&amp;amp;#39;d back into the market (with $533m) and are now $718m in profit ($1.2b total). It helps that they have half a billion in scratch to throw around, but they still have the huevos to take the L and come back in. I expect they&amp;amp;#39;re going to be a HODLer going forward as they haven&amp;amp;#39;t sold into the recent pullback on price. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;No time like the present to set up your DCAs.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Benjamin Cowen has a &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/YW_uIO1AZAk&quot;&amp;gt;recent video&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; on this topic as well. Yes, he is my muse. No, I will not apologize for my financial proclivities.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yes I am talking about the sudden burst of anger from many of you about how Gavin Wood, head of Polkadot, and Sunny Lu, head of VeChain, have asked for Ukraine to post an address for them to donate. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To be clear... Donate their OWN FUCKING MONEY. Ukraine has asked for donations in any way that they can. Food, ammunition, guns, resources, food and water, fighters, and any assistance possible to fight a much larger force. The only reason they initially posted the addresses to BTC and ETH is because those are the two biggest currencies. They will take whatever funds they can possibly get and that is EXACTLY what these two are doing. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If I hear one more person say, oh well they could have converted it to BTC or ETH first and then sent it... Why should they have to? They have a large portion of their own individual wealth in the coin they created, they should be able to send that to help out and not get ridiculed by internet trolls thousands of miles away. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Not like they would give a shit anyway if you disagree about how they have donated because lets me real, they are trying to make a difference.... What have you done?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Two more things, these are both respected projects! It&amp;amp;#39;s not like someone is asking them to set up a wallet for elonspermshitfuckidontcare coin. These are coins that have a lot of backing and are known. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Leads me into the follow up, now you know what address to send those coins to if you want to donate! Honestly, I hope Ukraine eventually posts address to lots of coins so that countless people can band together and donate what they have in order to help. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We are better than this people, show the world that crypto is united and what we can really do to help. Last time I checked, Ukraine is getting close to 40 million in crypto donations, I hope to see that number reach 100 million and beyond very soon.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyways, ever since the grand slam dump of a fall from what was an astonishing number for a coin like doge, It has been in a constant downtrend ever since. Now currently at $0.122 from it&amp;amp;#39;s ath of $0.68, thats a fall of nearly 70%!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/kadgk0cpelk81.png?width=891&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=15f4b2d6d0c637c624ea0a2c22859b6dea2952b7&quot;&amp;gt;Consistent downtrend (1D chart)&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There have been minor jumps and pumps along the way, but after every single jump, there&amp;amp;#39;s a even bigger dump. The gap between pumps have been becoming higher and higher, and the duration of the pump has shown to be shortening over time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Is it safe to say the era of not memecoins, but dogecoin in reference is over? I honestly don&amp;amp;#39;t think Elon or anyone for that matter would be able to bring back the hype of dogecoin as it was back in May. I personally know many people who bought at the top and still hold for the &amp;amp;quot;$1 dogecoin!&amp;amp;quot; line. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I although did hold through .07 and saw my investment hit the multi-thousands. I didn&amp;amp;#39;t sell because of that line, my knowledge in cryptocurrency tokenomics has a huge role in my decision making. I&amp;amp;#39;m still baffled that Dogecoin managed to pull off being in Top 3 cryptocurrencies, when you look at it now. That&amp;amp;#39;s crazy!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyways, just wanted to discuss my thoughts. What do you think? I don&amp;amp;#39;t think doge will ever go back up aside from the little pumps it may have, definitely not close to where it was at it&amp;amp;#39;s highest.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
