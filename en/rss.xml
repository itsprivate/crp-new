But are the alternatives really so much better? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Recent news about Cardano congestion shooting up around 90% and more, Polygon being borderline unresponsive during Sunflower popularity/incident, and AVAX fees getting sky high while network suffered congestion a few months ago.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If these networks had the Ethereum levels of activitynon them, they wouldnt hold for long. Cardano has a handful of dapps and its already clogged? Same with Polygon. 1 dapp putting whole network on stop is really not what people would expect of the so called &amp;amp;quot;next gen eth competitors.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While I 100% agree that gas fees on Ethereum are absurd, I wonder if the alternatives that we have at the moment in top10 are going to solve that. All claim insane TPS and finality times, but when the shit gets real, the fees and network congestion go up to the sky.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The sad thing about it, is that it has diminished my trust in most everyone. As a result, I approach all conversations cautiously, always thinking there&amp;amp;#39;s an angle to mislead. It sucks because I know there are good people out there, who really want to engage genuinely.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

As for the negative &amp;amp;quot;, you need a psychiatrist, go touch grass, take a break&amp;amp;quot; feedback; this sub is a place to foster discussion about the world of crypto, and this is an aspect of that world.

Fuck this country man so tired of this fucking government fuck the system. I&amp;amp;#39;m so frustated and deperessed reading these types of news warning about cryptocurrency. The government doesnot give a fuck about development it&amp;amp;#39;s all corrupted from the root. I want to keep a low profile now but fuck man talk about freedom nothing like this actually exist we are just bind by the shitty rules made by government. kudos to those who live in a country where you can hold and trade cryptos freely and can experience financial freedom. I have huge respect for those country. I want to get out of this shithole country and do what I want freely.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Micheal Patryn is a convicted felon who has served time in US for his criminal enterprises.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The co-founder of troubled cryptocurrency exchange QuadrigaCX is a convicted felon who served time in the United States for his role in an online identity-theft ring.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Michael Patryn helped launch Quadriga’s trading platform in 2013 alongside Gerald Cotten. The company has come under intense scrutiny since Mr. Cotten, its chief executive, died at the age of 30 from complications of Crohn’s disease while on his honeymoon in India last December, leaving the exchange’s users unable to access $250-million in cash and cryptocurrency.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Amount stolen from QuadrigaX? $135m

Every month, 50% of Moons burned are meant to be reintroduced in the following distribution, but because of a bug in the contract this has not been happening as expected. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We have deployed an update to the smart contracts to fix the distributions going forward (it won’t apply to this current round but will apply to future rounds after this one). &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For those interested, here are the details from the team for what happened: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://testnet.redditspace.com/address/0x22037C488520DF547c2cd2AA0BE70517082BDA1C/contracts&quot;&amp;gt;buggy Distributions Contract&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; on lines 1705 - 1708, we are adding the Points totalSupply from the previous round to the number of Points claimed in the previous round.  If that total is less than the current Points totalSupply, then that means points were burned (less points exist now than were minted).  However, this code has a bug where it does not account for the Points issued to the SharedOwners.   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is fixed in the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://testnet.redditspace.com/address/0x255b868d0C13C45123085cb574218667433C7E4b/contracts&quot;&amp;gt;updated Distributions Contract&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; lines 1701 &amp;amp;amp; 1747 by keeping track of the Points issued to the SharedOwners in the previous round, and including them in the count of total Points issued for the previous round.  This fix requires 1 distribution round to start working, so burned points will start being reintroduced in the Round 23 distribution.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;***&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This distribution of Moons has been finalized, and Moons are being delivered to users with a registered Vault. Users who do not have a Vault yet will get their Moons when they create one through the Reddit app.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This distribution is based on karma earned from 2021-12-22 to 2022-01-18. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://reddit-meta-production.s3.amazonaws.com/distribution/publish/CryptoCurrency/round_22_finalized.csv&quot;&amp;gt;Here&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; is the finalized list, with contribution scores signed by Reddit.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Moons are &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/CryptoCurrency&quot;&amp;gt;r/CryptoCurrency&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#39;s form of &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://reddit.com/community-points&quot;&amp;gt;Community Points&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, a way for users to be rewarded for their contributions to the subreddit, and they can be used on premium features in the community.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

When I first landed it felt hot, lovely. Had to wait for a friend so I grabbed the rental car, where they try and scam you for insurance, and went for a coffee. Friend arrived and we drove to El Zonte a.k.a Bitcoin Beach.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The drive we thought we were going to be shot, not sure why but you hear stories. We didn’t get shot. Checked in the Airbnb no probs, no hot water though.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Next day we drive to the beach for coffee and bump straight into Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert, said hi, Stacy was nice but Max was not interested, I probably wouldn’t be to be fair, especially when I’m after a coffee.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitcoin signs everywhere, talked to a bunch of people and some knew about bitcoin but mostly not, felt like just a lot of travellers there passing through. I think all the stuff you see online you assume everyone is walking around with Chivo wallets but it doesn’t seem to be the case, maybe other places it’s like that but not here.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We contacted some estate/realtor agents and saw two properties just to see what’s available, this place literally has nothing, when I say nothing I mean you’ll need to put water in, electricity, it’s so behind the times that most people here live in tin shacks by the road/river. It seems that there’s chancers there trying their luck to get bitcoiners to buy shacks but there really isn’t any point… the reality is you can’t either, not straight forward anyway as you’ll need a lawyer and even if you buy something you’re not 100% sure you own it, it’s confusing, plus the government has some rule where they can take property off people.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My thoughts are this won’t be the future of Bitcoin, it’s so behind the times. The people were lovely, beautiful scenery, great weather but realistically this place will take 20 years to develop and in the next couple of years there will most likely be other countries adopting Bitcoin, countries which are already developed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;El Salvador is definitely cool and will probably the Mecca/pilgrimage place for the future of where it all started to be accepted but I can’t see it being anything but that. I actually hope I’m wrong because it was first and deserves so much more but after visiting and seeing how undeveloped it is I’d be very surprised if people actually go there.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If anyone has been to San Salvador and people are daily using their Chivo wallets then please comment, I hope there is more use of it as I read millions of people have them but whether they’re active accounts would be interesting to know.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The last thing I want to say is this trip has made me realise how truly early we are still… one place is using Bitcoin and it’s underdeveloped. I can’t imagine what Bitcoin will be like when everyone is using it… it blows my mind! It’s so early.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Ah yes, the holidays. A time for feasting, partying, reconnecting, and yes, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;financial advice&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. After being in crypto for a few years, I decided this holiday season was the time I would finally come out of the crypto closet to my family. I told them about the fundamentals of DeFi. I told them about specific projects I am invested in. I suggested to them to invest also.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Well, some of them did invest, and they’ve been staring at the same red dildos for the past month as the rest of us. Having bought in before the crash and with no bear market experience, some of them even sold at a loss. Tbh I think they aped with all their holiday checks and a few months savings.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The other half who didn’t buy refrained from doing so because they think I’m an idiot for buying crypto. It’s fair to say they think I’m more of an idiot now.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TL/DR: The half of my family who bought in wants to burn my house down, and the other half thinks I’m a clown with my magic internet money. Hooray for me.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I would expect Reddit to be equally if not more supportive of crypto than the general public or that I might expect to see from say in a comments section on Yahoo News, however when I see Bitcoin or Crypto mentioned in more mainstream Reddit subs like &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/news&quot;&amp;gt;r/news&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; or others everyone seems to be talking shit about &amp;amp;quot;crypto bros&amp;amp;quot; or making references to Beanie Babies, its kind of crazy to me as Reddit tends to sku younger and be very tech friendly. Here&amp;amp;#39;s some of the types of comments I&amp;amp;#39;m talking about and these are like handpicked comments this sentiment seems to be the majority.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Looks like Cryptobros will have to go back to Amway.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Pyramid scheme&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Anyone who thinks the world&amp;amp;#39;s governments and central banks are going to allow unregulated virtual currency to take over is dillusional.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;&amp;amp;quot;Let&amp;amp;#39;s pretend a speculative asset masquerading as the most deflationary currency ever is the future of finance. This is a Very Good Idea and I&amp;amp;#39;m actually an expert on economics, not a con artist trying to attract as many suckers as possible to pay me real money for my hoarded assets.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;I’m not convinced it is here to stay. What is the utility of bitcoin? At least gold is used in electronics, jewelry etc…&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Digital Beanie Babies.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;I put my entire net worth into beanie babies and He-Man action figures.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;I mean NFTs are basically the crypto equivalent of beanie babies with the difference being that with beanie babies you actually have something that is worth a damn whereas NFTs are a fucking worthless scam.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Jesus fuck what is wrong with that dude?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;El Salvadors President Jesus fuck what is wrong with that dude?&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;This year, I invested in pumpkins. They&amp;amp;#39;ve been going up the whole month of October and I got a feeling they&amp;amp;#39;re going to peak right around January. Then, bang! That&amp;amp;#39;s when I&amp;amp;#39;ll cash in.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;I’m sticking with my tulip bulbs.I’m sticking with my tulip bulbs.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Obligatory Beanie Babies vs Bitcoin Investment Guide&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;This happens to things whose only value is derived from what people are willing to pay for it. That bitcoin is worth anything is only because people think they will be able to sell it for more than they bought/manufactured it for. Maybe I&amp;amp;#39;m wrong, but I don&amp;amp;#39;t think bitcoin is substantially different than beanie babies. If people decide it&amp;amp;#39;s no longer valued, it&amp;amp;#39;s just virtual junk.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;COVID. All the predictions of OMICRON disaster were wildly overstated. Here in the UK, ALL restrictions will be permanently abolished from this Saturday. The same in several other European countries.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Ukraine. Despite the chest thumping, there will be no major conflagration in Ukraine. Russia cannot afford to lose face and will back down - whilst making a small, grandiose gesture.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Putin has confirmed that Russia will NOT be banning crypto. That was obvious, but it&amp;amp;#39;s still bullish news.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;BTC Futures are currently at 0.93 - the highest for some time. The markets have fully priced in the gradual phasing out of tapering and up to 4 x 0.25% rate increase this year.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Global supply chains are recovering faster than governments expected. Again, this is due to Covid becoming less menacing.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The US Labor Market is now officially &amp;amp;#39;Strong&amp;amp;#39;.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There will be serious profit taking in the next few hours, but that&amp;amp;#39;s to be expected. But we&amp;amp;#39;re now back on firm ground until the Spring.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

If you don&amp;amp;#39;t, you will probably read about it in the history books for it may have been one of the most important meetings in modern history.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Granted this is reddit so I don&amp;amp;#39;t have any proof, but it makes a lot of sense so follow along:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Erdogan has been orange pilled. I think he, as well as anyone, realizes that American empire is collapsing. There is zero appetite for any military action &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;anywhere&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; and barring some Pearl Harbour-like event, I don&amp;amp;#39;t see the US going to war for anything.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So the world police has left the station, and they&amp;amp;#39;re not coming back. When America is no longer interested in world affairs, all of the institutions America built during the post-war era will fall as well. The purpose of institutions like the IMF and the World Bank was always to serve America&amp;amp;#39;s interests, ideological or Machiavellian. Without the US steering the ship, they will be lost and eventually rendered completely neutered. It will be like the Oscar&amp;amp;#39;s of politics; no one will even care enough to notice when it&amp;amp;#39;s finally gone.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This of course leaves a huge power vacuum in all sorts of different avenues, especially in international trade. Through the Petrodollar system, all oil trade around the world settles in USD. This gave the US immense soft power, since all oil importing countries like Turkey are forced to acquire dollars somehow and if they want to acquire dollars, they have to follow America&amp;amp;#39;s wishes. If they didn&amp;amp;#39;t want to adhere to the rules of the Petrodollar, they were free to join Saddam Hussein and Gaddafi six feet down under.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But like we&amp;amp;#39;ve already established; the US won&amp;amp;#39;t do another Iraq, nor another Libya. There is so little appetite for war that I believe that any attempt to start one might be enough to ignite a domestic revolution. The time for countries to free themselves from the Petrodollar is ripe.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Countries like Turkey then have two options; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Either they enter a similar agreement with China, and let China become the new global super power who gets to call the shots.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;or they will build alternative systems where no single super power is in control.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I think it is fairly obvious what alternative is preferable for anyone who isn&amp;amp;#39;t Chinese. The only question is &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;how&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; would anyone be able to build institutions that can withstand Chinese pressure?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Enter bitcoin. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here one might question whether the ideals of bitcoin are compatible with an increasingly authoritarian Turkish government. I don&amp;amp;#39;t think however that Erdogan, nor any other leader, is particularly ideological. They want to stay in power of course but &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;how&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; they do so isn&amp;amp;#39;t the central focus. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyone who lives in a country that has been bullied by super powers knows the shame it brings to the people. It is one thing to be pushed around by one of your own, but to be pushed around by foreigners? A million times worse. If leaders of smaller countries like Erdogan, Bukele etc. manage to free their countries from American control &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;without&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; entering a similarly abusive relationship with China, they will forever be entrenched in the nation&amp;amp;#39;s collective memory, and they realize this. Bitcoin is their opportunity to do precisely that. In my opinion, it is their only option. They will never be able to convince any other country of joining an international monetary network that themselves control. But convincing other countries to join a network &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;no one&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; controls might actually not be a very difficult task, for the reasons stated above. Every single country in the world are sick and tired of getting bullied by America and the last thing they want is to be bullied by a new super power, regardless of how authoritarian the regime might be. Bitcoin is the key that solves this puzzle. Bukele was the first head of state to come to this realization. He will not be the last.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TLDR;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The 20th century was the era of centralisation. With the fall of the American empire, we will enter an era of decentralisation. All the pieces are in play and now we are just waiting for the dominos to fall.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To finish this, I&amp;amp;#39;d like to end with a quote from Erdogan from last month:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Turkey will never again submit its political and economic future to the prescriptions of global economic tutelage institutions, such as the IMF and similar institutions,&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aa.com.tr/en/politics/turkey-will-never-submit-its-economic-future-to-imf-president-erdogan/2435775&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.aa.com.tr/en/politics/turkey-will-never-submit-its-economic-future-to-imf-president-erdogan/2435775&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;del&amp;gt;As you might have already guessed with stocks shooting up, and cryptos spking, we didn&amp;amp;#39;t get the doom and gloom news today, we got some moderately bullish news.&amp;lt;/del&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;del&amp;gt;Keep in mind, inflation is still very high, so it&amp;amp;#39;s not all rosy either.&amp;lt;/del&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;del&amp;gt;So long term, there are still major economic issues looming.&amp;lt;/del&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;del&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s also not super bullish for liquidity, or artificially propping up stocks with lowered rates.&amp;lt;/del&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;del&amp;gt;But it&amp;amp;#39;s a fine balance, and probably a best case scenario.&amp;lt;/del&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;del&amp;gt;In the minutes they mention unemployment has dropped, and the economic outlook is improving, according to the Fed.&amp;lt;/del&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;del&amp;gt;So maybe no stock market crash...for this week.&amp;lt;/del&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;del&amp;gt;Meaning maybe no Bitcoin crash below $30K this week either.&amp;lt;/del&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;del&amp;gt;In fact, the spike in Bitcoin could potentially create a short squeeze, and we could see prices above $40K this week.&amp;lt;/del&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;del&amp;gt;But we are not quiet out of the woods yet:&amp;lt;/del&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;del&amp;gt;We still have the press meeting....so don&amp;amp;#39;t pull out the party hats yet.&amp;lt;/del&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;del&amp;gt;We still need to hear how dovish or hawkish JPow might sound, and we haven&amp;amp;#39;t heard about timelines.&amp;lt;/del&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The time to end tribalism is now. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The church of Charles Hoskinson (yes that guy many of you love to hate) just blessed us with a video and I really think you need to watch it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/a2IP9ApZuUU&quot;&amp;gt;https://youtu.be/a2IP9ApZuUU&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Basically the government is about to pass this “America Competes” bill under the guise of staying competitive against China. It’s a load of crap. The bill sneaks in a part where the secretary of Treasury (Janet Yellen) will have full control to just ban assets at will.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That means she can ban ALL of crypto or just certain ones in particular. She can wake up and say hey no more ETH trading in America. Exchanges will have to comply. This is serious.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I normally don’t post because I’m not good with all the formatting and pretty pictures but this is so fucking serious guys. Stop with the stupid tribalism, stop acting like children. Now is the time to come together and reach out to the people who live off our tax dollars that are supposed to serve us. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When you follow the money guess who’s lobbying so hard for this to pass? Ding ding ding : the Goldman Sachs Mafia. Banks are finally trying to put the nail in the coffin for crypto. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TLDR: stop bickering for one moment and pay attention to this BS legislation that’s about to change crypto. Also fuck off and read my shit, it’s like 10 sentences.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Included in the America COMPETES Act just introduced in the House, and which will very likely pass in some form, is a provision that would be disastrous not just for bitcoin but for privacy and due process generally. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/yd6ndzcdr2e81.png?width=680&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=9f30615c6ce3bb070f5d57d6b9c1e70591efdde1&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/yd6ndzcdr2e81.png?width=680&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=9f30615c6ce3bb070f5d57d6b9c1e70591efdde1&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The so-called &amp;amp;quot;special measures&amp;amp;quot; provision would essentially give the Treasury Secretary unchecked and unilateral power to ban exchanges and other financial institutions from engaging in cryptocurrency transactions. How would it do this? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/oe75dflgr2e81.png?width=900&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=fc361154d9da4c892574720e50f0dc4368375cc0&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/oe75dflgr2e81.png?width=900&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=fc361154d9da4c892574720e50f0dc4368375cc0&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bank Secrecy Act §5318A allows the Secretary to identify a &amp;amp;quot;primary money laundering concern&amp;amp;quot; and take &amp;amp;quot;special measures&amp;amp;quot; to (1) require financial institutions to report information on the concern, and/or (2) prohibit FIs from maintaining accounts related to the concern. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Special measures&amp;amp;quot; authority is vast power that the Secretary of the Treasury has today, so in the current statute there are checks on that power. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;First, the law requires that Treasury engage in a public rulemaking before instituting a prohibition. Second, the secretary can impose a surveillance special measure through a simple order, but its duration is limited to 120 days and must be accompanied by a public rulemaking. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While not full due process, these limitations at least alert the public and gives the public some opportunity to comment on a special measure&amp;amp;#39;s merit or constitutionality. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The new provision would do three things:  -Add &amp;amp;quot;certain transmittal of funds&amp;amp;quot; to the list of things that can be banned by the Secretary  -Eliminate all public notice and comment requirements  -Eliminate the 120-day limitation for measures imposed without regulation &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/xhvownvlr2e81.jpg?width=583&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=a2e0bc4cc2f6777391e35e447099fc21d8a8c1b7&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/xhvownvlr2e81.jpg?width=583&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=a2e0bc4cc2f6777391e35e447099fc21d8a8c1b7&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If adopted into law, this provision would be disaster not just for crypto but for privacy and democratic public process related to *all* types of financial transactions. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It empowers the Secretary to prohibit any (or indeed all) cryptocurrency transactions (or any other kind of transaction) without any process, rulemaking, or limitation on the duration of the prohibition. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This provision was first introduced as an amendment to the national Defense Authorization Act last year  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/n8eg358pr2e81.png?width=680&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=08418895f5e69fd1104c27b73c7a0e003b87a01d&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/n8eg358pr2e81.png?width=680&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=08418895f5e69fd1104c27b73c7a0e003b87a01d&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After alerting folks in the House and Senate of that amendment&amp;amp;#39;s unintended consequences, it was removed from the final bill that passed. Unfortunately it&amp;amp;#39;s back verbatim without any improvements. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It still strips out *all* administrative process and duration limitations on the Secretary’s power to condition or prohibit transactions at financial institutions associated with primary money laundering concerns. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s time to call your member of Congress and ask that they take action to make sure that notice and comment and duration limitations are not removed from 31 U.S.C. § 5318A as the America COMPETES Act would do.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
