While it is good advice, it is very possible that we experience a recession in the near future and having an emergency fund is really important right now. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For those who don&amp;amp;#39;t know what an emergency fund is, it&amp;amp;#39;s essentially a sum of money (yes, FIAT) that you set aside for large unexpected expenses such as job loss, unforeseen medical expenses, etc. I know current prices are tempting to just buy crypto but if and when we go into a recession, it&amp;amp;#39;s better to be safe than sorry.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The amount that you should put into an emergency fund is different for everyone and depends on what kind of support you would have if something happened. I generally stick to having enough stashed away to support myself for at least 3 months but depending on your situation, you may want more.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I know it&amp;amp;#39;s hard enough to set aside any money with prices being so high right now but having an emergency fund is more important than buying the dip.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

First, I took a list of all coins from CoinGecko API, and I filtered them to exclude leveraged tokens like &amp;amp;quot;SPDR S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 ETF tokenized stock FTX&amp;amp;quot; and of course shitcoins.
This step eliminated 7302 out of 13403 coins, leaving 6101 for the next step.
In the next step I filtered the remaining coins based on a few conditions I came up with:
- They must have an ATH Market Cap lower than 200k BTC (~$10B at good times), It&amp;amp;#39;s less likely to 20x if it already did before. Also there&amp;amp;#39;s usually a reason why it&amp;amp;#39;s not in the top anymore.
- The current market cap must be above 4000 BTC ($80M) - most of those below are scams.
- The current market cap must be also below 50000 BTC ($1B), the higher the market cap the less volatile the coin is, reducing the chance for a 20x.
- The supply has to be between 1 million and 1 trillion, no serious project goes beyond this limits.
- Lastly, it can&amp;amp;#39;t be more than 90% down from its ATH in BTC, if you look into the coins of 2021 bull market, you&amp;amp;#39;ll see that none of them have a history like this.
I used BTC for all comparisons because it makes all the bull markets more equal to each other.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After these steps we are left with 74 coins out of 6101. I filtered them out by hand to pick the best 6 I don&amp;amp;#39;t own yet, so my opinion is objective. Here are the coins that survived:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Arweave (AR)
Arweave is a file storage system like Filecoin, except you pay once to store the data forever, so you don&amp;amp;#39;t need to worry about running out of money and losing your data.
In Blockweave (Arweave&amp;amp;#39;s variation of Blockchain) every block has to reference a randomly chosen historical block, incentivising miners to store more data.
Currently there is 70 TB of data stored on Arveawe. For example if you store 10% of all data, you have 10% chance to be able to mine a block. This mechanism also reduces the power of ASICs in mining.
Arweave was launched in June 2018, and its market cap hit 46k BTC ($2.88B at max) 4 times in 2021 and currently has a Market cap of 19k BTC ($390M).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Stacks (STX)
Stacks is an L1 blockchain, but it serves as a Smart Contract layer for Bitcoin. It uses a consensus mechanism called Proof of Transfer AKA Proof of Burn, it consists of 2 parties - Miners and Stackers.
Bitcoin miners can deposit their BTC rewards on Stacks to receive STX and write a Stacks block. Stackers on the other hand lock STX to receive the BTC from deposited by the miners.
Unfortunately Stacks&amp;amp;#39; smart contracts are incompatible with EVM, maybe they want to be more distinct from Ethereum and alts in general. Other chains like this have been successful anyway though.
A downside of this model is the block time which just like in Bitcoin is 10 minutes, but in return receives Bitcoin level security and has super low transaction fees as low as $0.00007.
Stacks was launched in January 2019, had its highest market cap of 70k BTC or $3.74B in December 2021 and currently sits at 25k BTC ($520M).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Mina Protocol (MINA)
Mina Protocol is a lightweight blockchain designed to have a constant size of 22 KB using zkSNARKs (without trusted setup). With these 22 KB you can fully participate in the network including consensus.
One worrying thing about MINA is its inflation, in the last year alone the coin&amp;amp;#39;s supply has tripled. Every coin has an inflation phase although MINA has one that&amp;amp;#39;s very long.
The annual inflation will decrease to around 20% in late 2023 which will make it way safer.
Mina was launched in May 2021, and its market cap had an ATH of 35k BTC ($1.55B) in April 2022. Its current market cap is 19k BTC ($390M).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;1inch (1INCH)
1inch takes prices from lots of different DEXs and compares its prices to get the best rate. This costs you a bit more in fees, but it&amp;amp;#39;s worth it.
Another feature of 1inch is its Mobile Wallet, which makes trading on a phone way more user friendly. It supports 8 different EVM compatible chains and they recently added support for different dapps.
The token is not an important part of the dapp, but considering Uniswap and PancakeSwap have their tokens in the Top 50, it might join Top 50 as well..
1inch launched in December 2020. Its market cap peaked at 24k BTC ($1.2B) in December 2021, and the current market cap is 17k BTC or $350M&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Secret Network (SCRT)
Secret Network is a smart contract platform that features fully private smart contracts. It&amp;amp;#39;s built on the Cosmos SDK and supports the IBC cross chain bridge.
A downside of SCRT is that it uses Trusted Execution Enviroments (TEE) which are parts of CPU that are most likely going to be cracked someday, but it&amp;amp;#39;s still good for short-term privacy.
SCRT also has a few non-IBC decentralized bridges for Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain and Monero. The existence of a Monero token decreases the usage of SCRT token, altough it&amp;amp;#39;s also good.
Secret Network launched in September 2020. In its peak in January 2022 its market cap was 34k BTC ($1.45B). Now its market cap is only 7.7k BTC ($160M)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Nervos Network (CKB)
Nervos Network connects all families of smart contracts platform like EVM and IBC. It allows developers to make Universal dApps for different blockchains using the same code.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I did the research in the process of writing this post, do your own research if you&amp;amp;#39;re interested in these coins.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Please read and consider before commenting or downvoting.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is a response to &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/vrcb1h/i_calculated_how_much_a_coin_would_be_worth_from/&quot;&amp;gt;this post&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; that got a lot of attention recently.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I get it. Alt-coins are enticing. But the above post is very dangerous. People who read the above post seem to erroneously assume that all of those alt coins will eventually come back to its ATH. Because crypto always comes back, right? This leads readers to conclude that they should put money in the alt-coin that has fallen the most percentage-wise for the highest gains when the ATH comes back. This is NOT analysis. This is a fun, fantastical thought experiment. None of this logic is based in reality, I&amp;amp;#39;ll do my best to explain.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Let me start with this statement that should be the whole takeaway of this post: *&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;NO MAINSTREAM ALT-COIN HAS EVER ACHIEVED ATH AGAINST BITCOIN IN TWO CONSECUTIVE CYCLES.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; (*The only exception I know of is Dogecoin, and only because Elon pumped it. Hardly a sustainable model or basis for investment. So it&amp;amp;#39;ll be ignored for this post.)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What this means is, every dollar you invest in crypto will be better going to Bitcoin than any other coin. I know a lot of people love their alt-coin projects that they are passionate about. I love crypto and want to see it succeed. But please look at the price history of alt-coins. They all fail against bitcoin in the long run. I&amp;amp;#39;m not trying to crap on any alt-coin project you are passionate about, it very well &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;may&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; succeed and be the next bitcoin. All I&amp;amp;#39;m saying is let&amp;amp;#39;s look at how well this bet has performed in the past.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Pretty much every alt-coin price history looks something like this:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/2p967fpnija91.png?width=1890&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=02d96d6103f84cf9cae4abfb4670e91b8156fea1&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/2p967fpnija91.png?width=1890&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=02d96d6103f84cf9cae4abfb4670e91b8156fea1&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here&amp;amp;#39;s FTM. A decent project that was promoted by many. Such is the alt-coin life cycle. There&amp;amp;#39;s a price discovery in a bull run, temporary euphoria (this is where most of us buy in, near the ATH), and then death. Doesn&amp;amp;#39;t recover from that. Go look for yourself! Look up any alt-coin price history and it&amp;amp;#39;ll look pretty much like this. It would have been better to put that money in Bitcoin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But what if we just weather the bear market? Just like the above post in question, what if we buy more when it&amp;amp;#39;s low and get XXX% return when it hits the ATH again! It&amp;amp;#39;s a bigger return than even Bitcoin returning to its ATH! People I know did this same &amp;amp;quot;what if it went back to ATH?&amp;amp;quot; experiment back in 2019. We all put a decent amount of money into NANO, because we would 30x our money! Well, look what happened:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/7qcwew1pija91.png?width=1888&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=002daf610a4a3bfdb4112f4398111fdb7e795c8c&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/7qcwew1pija91.png?width=1888&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=002daf610a4a3bfdb4112f4398111fdb7e795c8c&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Didn&amp;amp;#39;t get close to its ATH. It would have been better to put that money in Bitcoin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But what about coins where it DOES hit another ATH? Some coins will do that, here&amp;amp;#39;s ADA for example:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/e4k2odbqija91.png?width=1894&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=65ae3ba3c25bc1e76588c45f2a1cb4f533b45142&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/e4k2odbqija91.png?width=1894&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=65ae3ba3c25bc1e76588c45f2a1cb4f533b45142&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It shattered it&amp;amp;#39;s ATH! What a great one to hold! Actually, no. Look at it&amp;amp;#39;s price against Bitcoin:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/5by4lhuqija91.png?width=1880&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=dbebc656e9d64c18272326826a40649c294fc6db&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/5by4lhuqija91.png?width=1880&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=dbebc656e9d64c18272326826a40649c294fc6db&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Even ADA, the &amp;amp;quot;ETH-Killer&amp;amp;quot; didn&amp;amp;#39;t reach another ATH against bitcoin. It would have been better to put that money in Bitcoin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And here&amp;amp;#39;s ETH:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/mb7hfvq8yja91.png?width=1874&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e62eb3387c24a0b8ce83bff3bccce66ea46314d1&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/mb7hfvq8yja91.png?width=1874&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e62eb3387c24a0b8ce83bff3bccce66ea46314d1&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yes, ETH, like some alt-coins, retouched it&amp;amp;#39;s USD ATH. But not against Bitcoin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For any dollar you put into a crypto that&amp;amp;#39;s NOT bitcoin, you are making one of the worst bets in history. Far worse than casino odds. You are literally betting for something to happen that has pretty much never happened before. Yet people still put money in alt-coins! Even the &amp;amp;quot;smart money&amp;amp;quot; does. A 2019 study by Deloitte found that a simple buy and hold strategy of bitcoin outperformed every single crypto hedge fund. Embarrassing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Another AWFUL bet is anything in the top 10! Every coin that entered the top 10 has lost value against BTC from then on. And when one leaves the top 10, it has never returned. (Again, except DOGE). If you own a coin in the top 10, or worse, continue owning it after it leaves the top 10, you are making one of the worst bets in history! It doesn&amp;amp;#39;t matter how passionate you are about the community, or how much you just know/believe that the coin will be the next big thing. History shows you are most definitely wrong in this bet. Should put the money in Bitcoin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One case for alt-coins that lots of people make is the bitcoin dominance chart. Guy from Coin bureau likes to point this one out a lot. According to him, it has been &amp;amp;quot;dropping like a rock&amp;amp;quot; since 2017:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/rw8wnptrija91.png?width=2714&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e68b17a33b1b1a6c8341aac05cd7f3a2ee025d51&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/rw8wnptrija91.png?width=2714&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e68b17a33b1b1a6c8341aac05cd7f3a2ee025d51&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So the future is alt-coins right? Bitcoin is clearly losing market share to alts, right? Actually, this metric tells the opposite. Consider the sheer number of coins now in existence, along with the insane growth of stablecoins. If all components of this metric remained constant over the past several years, then I would agree that the future seems to be alt-coins. However, in 2017 there were less than 1000 cryptocurrencies. Now there are over 20,000! And value in stablecoins has exploded. So now, there are 20x more alt-coins and over 100 billions dollars of stablecoins in the denominator of this metric competing for marketshare against bitcoin. To have all that be added to the denominator and BTC dominance still be so high is remarkable, and only proves that it will continue to be the most valuable chain for the foreseeable future. History shows any bet against bitcoin has been a bad one.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Lastly, if you simply MUST invest in an alt-coin for whatever reason, here&amp;amp;#39;s my advice on how to do it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Ignore any alt-coins that have already made the upside-down V pattern in the first visual. If that&amp;amp;#39;s already happened anywhere in its price history, then ignore it.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Find a new alt-coin that has a sideways price pattern and was created during the current crypto winter.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Its value proposition must be something that hasn&amp;amp;#39;t had a bubble yet. No BTC forks/clones. No NFTs or platform tokens. No DeFi or DEX coins. Something new, like maybe soul-bound tokens for this next rally? (Not a soul-bound token itself, because that can&amp;amp;#39;t be sold, but a token for its infrastructure)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Sell it somewhere in the next bull run. Don&amp;amp;#39;t get too greedy, take the profits and put them in Bitcoin.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I do not consider myself to be a Bitcoin Maxi. Too many people lose money in alt-coin projects. Too many newbies buy an alt-coin as their first coin. Yes, there is money to be made in alt-coins, but mostly by getting in and out at the right time, not through a buy and hold which is 1000x easier. Yes, there&amp;amp;#39;s money to be made in some alts, but by and large it&amp;amp;#39;s better for the money to be put in Bitcoin. If someone has more info to prove me wrong or teach me something, please do. But unless you can, please learn from the price history of alt-coins. Buy bitcoin, put it in cold storage, and wait. History *so far* has shown that to be the best thing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;tl;dr Price history of alt-coins against Bitcoin proves that holding alt-coins are always a bad investment.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here&amp;amp;#39;s a comparison of the volume prior to the spike.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Compared to the average volume we&amp;amp;#39;ve had for the past several weeks, this volume is now around 20 times what we normally had.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/33qzdri2uda91.jpg?width=898&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=a5f7fb87c8db5a684a83e4efb957624fefd44207&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/33qzdri2uda91.jpg?width=898&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=a5f7fb87c8db5a684a83e4efb957624fefd44207&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On the one hour chart, it looks like the Burj Khalifa:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here&amp;amp;#39;s the daily volume comparison for the entire bear market:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/bjk6h8kluda91.jpg?width=898&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=48fd01152082e86edb9ad939fdf0ee74b39f0e2e&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/bjk6h8kluda91.jpg?width=898&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=48fd01152082e86edb9ad939fdf0ee74b39f0e2e&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I have a few theories:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;1- Selling pressure has been exhausted. All sellers have already pulled out. We may be entering an accumulation phase.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;2- Celsius wasn&amp;amp;#39;t dumping Bitcoin. It was swapping its wBTC for BTC, at a big volume.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;3-Just like with stocks, the market is trying to buy the rumor, and trying to jump early on a future economic recovery. They&amp;amp;#39;re not gonna wait until the bullish news start to pour out.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;4-Many whales, institutional investors, hedge funds, and big players, may have been holding off on buying for several months, possibly since late last year. And with the bloodbath on retailers, and signal of a bottom,  they are jumping back in.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;5- There is a big increase on margin trading, and borrowing. People may be broke, but they still want to take advantage of the price drop. So they are starting to use borrowed money. Also big players are close to get margin called, and maybe are trying to pump back the price. Probably also with a lot of borrowed money.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;6- Short and longs are battling it out at much higher intensity.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;7- Free trading fees on Binance.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It might really be a combination of many of those.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This feels like one of those things where in a few months there will be an update post where Reddit Admins are apologizing for ‘missing the mark’, and telling us ‘we hear you’ when they announce its going away.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;NFTs are cancer, even if you go out of your way to not say the word NFT.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;so I personally like the one I bought (first NFT I&amp;amp;#39;ve bought) but the non crypto general population on reddit seam to really hate the idea of NFTs.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

As of Jan. 01st 2021 it had a price of $.399 and a circulating supply of 1.19B it ended the year with a price of $1.66 and a circulating supply of 6.36B. Meaning over the course of a year in 2021, Algorand inflated at a rate of 533%.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/43aaht1u0aa91.png?width=361&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=70aae78d46e82748f03b2f765c5868a4290557df&quot;&amp;gt;ALGO Information Jan. 01st 2021&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/7y0q6gtz0aa91.png?width=367&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=ecabb01246a3e40891f7e8fb32b6768cb29964f9&quot;&amp;gt;ALGO Information Dec. 31st 2021&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/fp38v6w21aa91.png?width=1196&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=d975874e301f0ca8fda2e1dcc72b1fdbb076a054&quot;&amp;gt;ALGO Circulating Supply graph 2021&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If we look at &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://messari.io/asset/algorand/chart/sply-circ&quot;&amp;gt;just the last year&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; the circulating supply increased from 3.11B to 6.97B an increase of 224% over the last year. Meaning for every 1 Algo that was in circulation 1 year ago there is now 2.24 Algo. That huge increase in the total number of circulating Algo helps to explain why the price has crashed so hard during this bear market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/dlriiwp71aa91.png?width=1218&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=49336fd84039f14c381ec5ff67d4f54712105124&quot;&amp;gt;ALGO Circulating Supply past year&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So the question is; What caused this mass inflation and should I be worried?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;What Caused the mass inflation:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; The short answer is &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://algorand.foundation/news/happening-now-relay-node-runners-voting-on-eip-11252019af&quot;&amp;gt;Algorand Accelerated Vesting&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; played a huge role, the Algorand team gave away &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://algorand.foundation/news/accelerated-vesting-complete&quot;&amp;gt;3.1B Algo through this program&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; with most of that being given away in 2021. Algorand Accelerated Vesting was designed to act as a loyalty system for early supporters of Algo and was proposed in Nov. 2019. It was designed to reward those vesting their Algo and provide an additional bonus for node runners.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The proposal was originally set to run through 2024, however there was a backup that would flood the market with Algo through the vesting program, if the price of Algo rose too quickly. Which as a result of the 2021 bull run - the vesting ended three and a half years early.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Should I be Worried:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Yes/No&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The good news

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Now that the accelerated vesting has ended, 2.63B of the remaining 3.03B Algo yet to be distributed is set to be distributed over the next 7 and a half years with the rate decreasing exponentially - through the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://algorand.foundation/governance&quot;&amp;gt;Algorand Community Governance Program&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. So the market should not continue to be flooded with newly minted Algo at the same rate as it was in 2021.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The Goodish Bad News

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Goodish: For those that were sitting on the sidelines looking to invest in Algo, you shouldn&amp;amp;#39;t have to worry about having the relative value of your investment watered down in the same way as it was in 2021. Assuming the total supply of ALGO never passes 10B - the max amount Algo can inflate in the future is, 42.8%.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Badish: If you&amp;amp;#39;re already significantly invested and purchased prior to Sep. 2021 the amount of Algo in circulation since you purchased has doubled (or more). Meaning the relative value of your investment considering the circulating supply has decreased by over half - For every 1 Algo in circulation when you purchased there is now 2-6 (depending on when you purchased in 2021).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The Bad News - The inflation rate of ALGO going forward isn&amp;amp;#39;t &amp;amp;quot;entirely clear&amp;amp;quot;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;At least 2B Algo was released into circulation in 2021 through means other than Accelerated Vesting&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;603M Algo has been released into circulation in 2022 so far &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;we&amp;amp;#39;re barely halfway through the year&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The inflation rate of Algo is supposed to decrease exponentially and &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://solberginvest.com/blog/algorand-inflation/&quot;&amp;gt;was supposed to be 6%&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; in 2022 - However it&amp;amp;#39;s currently at a 9.5% increase in the circulating supply for 2022 and again we&amp;amp;#39;re only halfway through the year.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;This can partially be accounted for by a drop in the difference between circulating supply and total supply - from roughly 550M in Oct. 2021 to roughly 400M currently according to CMC. However even accounting for that 150M ALGO that was added to circulating supply outside of regular inflation - The inflation rate so far in 2022 is nearly 7%, and again there is still half the year to go to bump up the inflation rate.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/d48qydmd1aa91.png?width=475&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=616c3b86f0e02bede747bb33914a9532245f34d1&quot;&amp;gt;Roughly 400M difference between circ. supply and total supply&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://algorand.foundation/governance/algo-dynamics&quot;&amp;gt;Algo Foundation website regarding distribution&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; doesn&amp;amp;#39;t exactly help with the confusion. In total the circulating supply has increased from 1.19B in the beginning of 2021 to roughly 6.97B today an increase of roughly 585% in a year and a half with the total supply sitting at 7.37B. According to the foundation website, Algo is supposed to have a total supply of about 6.67B by 2023 and we&amp;amp;#39;re already at 7.37B - again this can partially be accounted for by the fact that accelerated vesting finished three and a half years early.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also note according to the chart below the last roughly 1M tokens is supposed to be distributed from the end of 2025 to 2030.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/jn99yr6h1aa91.png?width=1114&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=b5a2402c729eca4a70b46c5645854d754acde6f8&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/jn99yr6h1aa91.png?width=1114&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=b5a2402c729eca4a70b46c5645854d754acde6f8&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So technically speaking ALGO inflation is &amp;amp;quot;supposed&amp;amp;quot; to decrease exponentially over the coming years so it&amp;amp;#39;s not totally surprising to see high inflation in the short term. If it does as it&amp;amp;#39;s supposed to we&amp;amp;#39;re through the worst of the inflation and the rate of inflation in 2026 will be a very low single-digit percent.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;If the ALGO 10B total supply number holds it&amp;amp;#39;s just a matter of riding out the massive inflation in the short term&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. But &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/t7lk8z/jasmy_token_rug_pull_warning/&quot;&amp;gt;a word of caution, JASMY&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; was supposed to have a total supply of 4.7B yet in total, it is over 20B.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TLDR: Algo mass inflated 585% in a year and a half, could be good for some - bad for others, assuming the 10B total supply holds. But the future inflation rate isn’t clear at this point.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Friendships were broken, but new bonds of brotherhood were forged in the raging furnaces of crypto forums. The epicness of this event makes me laugh at every chode suite and tie commenting on Bitcoin in mainstream news  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Must read for newcomers&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; My friend worked in the Bitcoin industry for a couple of years and has been involved in the crypto world since 2014. This is what he had to say about the recent politics of btc when someone asked him on our crypto trading channel&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;(He first sent this article &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@StopAndDecrypt/thats-not-bitcoin-this-is-bitcoin-95f05a6fd6c2&quot;&amp;gt;https://medium.com/@StopAndDecrypt/thats-not-bitcoin-this-is-bitcoin-95f05a6fd6c2&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, then followed up with this reply when someone told him he had no idea what he just read)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;There was a big scaling debate and in the end there were two sides. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Those that wanted to scale using bigger blocksize&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; (short term solution that doesn&amp;amp;#39;t work long term and also causes more centralization) &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;vs those who wanted to scale using changes in the code to make the network more efficient&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; aka SEGWIT+second layer scaling solutions (bitcoin becomes massive settlement layer, and second layer solutions can take care of verifying your $3.25 coffee payment).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On the big block side you had (most) miners because they were only able to see the short term benefits of increased blocksize and they do not care about network centralization. Also, a chinese miner, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Jihan Wu, controlling a sizeable chunk of the network&amp;amp;#39;s hashrate, had access to (and was in the process of patenting) this technology called ASICBOOST&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; which is an exploit in bitcoin code that allows you to &amp;amp;quot;cheat&amp;amp;quot; and get extra hashing power out of your miners&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;. Essentially they had an unfair advantage and the KEY is that the segwit upgrade fixes this exploit.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Alongside these &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;miners you had a couple of misguided (but incredibly wealthy because of early adoption) individuals&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; who either have a reason to see bitcoin fail (like they are heavily invested in altcoins now) or they are too pigheaded to back down when wrong (or some of them I&amp;amp;#39;m sure are not actually intelligent enough to understand they are wrong).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;On the Segwit side you had all the core developers&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; (the guys who worked side by side with satoshi to build all this and have been contributing to the code for years every day), &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;the majority of the userbase, AND the vast majority of bitcoin companies. The two sides were basically arguing over who had control over bitcoin - was it the miners, or was it the users?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Was it those who chose which software to run (users) or was it those who verified transactions for that software (miners)? &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;(The answer as you will see shortly is Users).&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So basically these miners were stalling the upgrade because it would mean the end of their unfair (AND patented) advantage. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;This massive stalemate in the debate caused a community led uprising known as the User Activated Soft Fork movement (UASF).&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; These guys basically said &amp;amp;quot;We&amp;amp;#39;re switching our nodes to Segwit software starting Aug 1 and we will be rejecting all mined blocks that do not comply with the new code&amp;amp;quot;. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;This forced the miners&amp;amp;#39; hand as they realized they would either be forked off the network or have to go along with the new upgrade&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; to make sure everything continued to go smoothly (including their profits).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The movement gained enough support to freak out some big money bitcoin CEOs who got together in a room with the miners and made a deal behind closed doors known as the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;New York Agreement (NYA). This is where Segwit2x was born&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The key to note here is that not a single core dev was invited to this meeting&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; (in fact, not a single competent dev in general was invited). The terms of the deal were: &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;You guys agree to implement Segwit now, and then we&amp;amp;#39;ll agree to an increase in block size later.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Deal was made and obviously the majority of the user community was in an uproar because bitcoiners hate closed door deals (and they should for good reason).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That being said, it got &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Segwit activated because it gave miners an easy way to safe face and go with segwit and the community instead of seeing their profits get wrecked by a messy chainsplit&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. However, do you remember that sneaky miner who had patented the ASICBOOST technology? Well he was part of the NYA and he decided to fork off anyway and create Bitcoin Cash. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;So stop right here and realize that the only reason we have bitcoin cash is so that some miner, Jihan Wu, with a ton of hashing power could keep his unfair advantage over the network&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; (he stills mainly mines bitcoin by the way because he would go out of business if he switched entirely to bitcoin cash). Also at this point, technically the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;NYA was broken&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; because the whole point of it was to avoid a chainsplit and go with segwit followed by a block size increase whereas bitcoin cash was a clear chainsplit.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So for a few months everything was ok because we had Segwit, core devs were still with us, and (supposedly) anyone who wanted bigger blocks had forked off to bitcoin cash right? &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Wrong. See it turns out that those guys who made that backroom deal with the miners also had their own interests which involve removing the current core developers from their (imagined) seat of power.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; It is classic old school business politics - they don&amp;amp;#39;t care that core the devs are based around principles of meritocracy and peer review. They just want to have more of a say in the direction bitcoin takes. At this point, you might be thinking, &amp;amp;quot;Ok but its fair for companies who use a product to have a say in its development, right?&amp;amp;quot; &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;NO. Not when the &amp;amp;quot;product&amp;amp;quot; at stake is meant to be an incredibly secure, incorruptible ledger that can hold trillions of dollars in wealth and still be hosted online accross the world.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The fact is that no one understands the code better than the core developers and no one has more of an interest in seeing bitcoin stay decentralized and secure than these guys do. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;These guys literally cum buckets everyday to how much they love coding bitcoin.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; If Satoshi is Cypher Jesus then these guys are his Apostles. And on the other hand you have some &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;severely misguided corporate buffoons who think they have the knowledge to negotiate a compromise with a group who has nothing but short term profit in their sights&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. And when the core developers are like &amp;amp;quot;wtf dude?&amp;amp;quot; and the community stands behind them, then these guys resort to essentially trying to kick core out of bitcoin by starting a new chain. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;A new chain which was based on a compromise that no one wants or needs anymore.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; And the excuse these CEO&amp;amp;#39;s are hiding behind is &amp;amp;quot;We don&amp;amp;#39;t want to go back on our word.&amp;amp;quot; Classic business mindset vs coding mindset.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;ur word.&amp;amp;quot; Classic business mindset vs coding mindset.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now we come to the current situation where there are basically 4 sides&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Core developers, and those supporting them&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The (remaining) signers of the NYA and those supporting Segwit2x&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Malicious third parties who just want to see bitcoin fail (invested in altcoins/bitcoin cash or they are the Joker and just want to see shit burn)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Innocent bystanders&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The core developers are continuing to code and improve bitcoin and they are working on second layer solutions. They haven&amp;amp;#39;t stopped development and have actually made a TON of beneficial changes to the code since the Segwit upgrade allowed them to. Being non-political or atleast being shit politicians, these guys do not know how to handle themselves with other people and either don&amp;amp;#39;t speak much or come off as pretentious d*bags (trust me I used to hate them before I smartened up).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The remaining NYA signers. I say remaining because alot of companies left when they saw the massive backlash from the community. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The only signers left are miners and then a group of around 30 companies which all have ties to Barry Silbert&amp;amp;#39;s holding company Digital Currency Group and suprise surprise who do you think got that NYA meeting together in the first place? Silly Silbert&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; indeed. He&amp;amp;#39;s basically trying to do a sort of corporate take over of bitcoin where he decides who is writing the code and how they write it. Oh also I should note here that &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;these guys have 1 developer working on the Segwit2x code. Yes 1, Jeff Garzik&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. Coding ability? Mediocre at best. All he did was copy and paste the entire bitcoin core code (because its open source) and changed the one little value that dictates block size. He changed a 1 to a 2 haha! And &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;when he tried to make other changes he made critical mistakes that had to be fixed by CORE DEVELOPERS&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; hahahaha! So how the f* does that even compare to an army of geeks who have been coding bitcoin for years and coding in general for decades who are all constantly trying to find mistakes in each others&amp;amp;#39; work. SO people supporting Segwit2x are either severely misguided, hate core devs, or don&amp;amp;#39;t have all the information to make an informed decision.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now the malicious actors. These are people who have a &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;vested interest in seeing bitcoin crumble. I&amp;amp;#39;m talking about big altcoin investors and bitcoin cash supporters&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; (yes the guys who have ASICBOOST and want are the reason for this whole mess in the first place). And Segwit2x has presented them with a beautiful vector of attack. Divide and conquer. Right? And whereas with bitcoin cash there was replay protection (meaning the split was pretty clean and bitcoin was largely unaffected) this time they haven&amp;amp;#39;t got any planned - so should things go through as planned, things could get messy.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then you have all those &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;innocent bystanders&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; who don&amp;amp;#39;t really know what to think anymore. Things have gotten so convoluted and complicated that it is hard to follow who wants what anymore. These are the people who will get the most fucked by something like Segwit2x because they won&amp;amp;#39;t understand the risks as it is happening and they won&amp;amp;#39;t have the knowledge to know which wallets to support. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Imagine Segwit2x happens and one wallet sticks with the core version of bitcoin and the other wallet supports the segwit2x version but they both just say &amp;amp;quot;Bitcoin&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That is why people are soooooooooooooo strongly opposed to Segwit2x more than anything. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;It is nothing more and nothing less than a hostile takeover attempt.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; And at this point that should be more than clear because why else would you still support the compromise made with miners who broke the compromise by creating bitcoin cash? &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;No one wanted Segwit2x in the first place. People wanted bigger blocks, or segwit, not both&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. Segwit2x was never a faction in the debate. It was a faction that was spawned by those who created the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;New York Agreement&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; because they saw an &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;opportunity take control of the software development&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; from a group of developers who have been working on it for years and who strongly oppose corporate interests getting involved in bitcoin development.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;(I will name and shame the main malicious\misguided actors and add details based on personal discussion with him and add articles for further reading)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;there you guys have it, a comprehensive rundown of bitcoin politics from the point of view of someone who supports the original vision of Satoshi Nakamoto to the core. I hope it informs those of you who got confused by the FUD.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Bitcoin belongs to the community, always and forever&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Post Scriptum&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;: the attack was called off in humiliation on &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;November 8th, 2017: Bitcoin&amp;amp;#39;s Independence Day&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; from the centralized entities, whose equivalent in the fiat world, control the wolrd with an iron vice grip. This is why, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;even if all exchanges burn to the ground, government tries to take over miners, bla bla bli bla bla bla, Bitcoin will be fine, has always been fine, and will continue to be fine&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Once More: Bitcoin belongs to the community, always and forever: the USD price, the big businesses acting like they own Bitcoin, the constant FUD, can suck our collective HODLER cock&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I have three kids, M**, A** and E**. I bought them each $100 worth of cryptos of their choice and will give them the entire investment when they turn 18. I let them make their choices based on whatever reasons they wanted. All I did was show them the top 100 list from coinmarketcap.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These are their allocations and reasons for each decision:  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;M** (9yrs old, boy): ETH, THETA, ADA.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; He really loved the black diamond and thought the other two had nice aesthetic designs.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;A** (7 yrs old, girl): ETH, AAVE, CRV.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; She also loved the black diamond, the AAVE has her favourite colour and starts with the same letter as her first name, CRV has a pretty rainbow.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;E** (4 yrs old, girl): UNI, ENJ, CAKE.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; She loves unicorns and therefore, loves UNI. The ENJ logo has a very pretty E for her name. CAKE because she loves pancakes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Solana is a ticking time bomb&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;(&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Hackers, Raiders, and Thieves are coming for your moneys.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Solana decided to build their smart contracts on Rust and C++. The crypto craze caused &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.efinancialcareers.com/news/2022/02/rust-programming-language&quot;&amp;gt;the demand for these developers to spike&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. When the demand exceeds the supply of experienced developers, companies start hiring anyone off the street regardless of their background. New developers typically write insecure code.  (&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Radicalists known as Newbies are building smart contracts on Solana.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Most of the Solana protocols are closed source. Nobody knows what the code is doing. This means there&amp;amp;#39;s no transparency to investors. Instead, it requires a lot of trust. Because of this, they focused heavily on yield farming and high interest lending which is a common trap. (&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Security is not a concern for Newbies. These contracts are stored in tombs built by an ancient civilization. They believe this will protect them. Purists claim the Prophecy has been misinterpreted. Research suggests they may be correct.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Solana developers compile their human readable code into machine code that runs on Solana. This obscures the logic and makes temporarily impossible to fully understand what exactly is happening. This does not stop hackers, it just slows them down. It also creates false security. &amp;amp;quot;Security through obscurity&amp;amp;quot;. They opted to use &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.solana.com/developing/on-chain-programs/overview&quot;&amp;gt;BPF&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; as their runtime bytecode. Sure, it makes their system run fast, but I think they cherry picked this variation so they could cut corners on security. Decompilers have not yet been created for BPF. Historically the incentive to do this was non existent. ( &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Blockchain explorers have discovered code scribed on the walls within the entrance of these tombs. Incantations written by tribal leaders during the early internet ages to protect Solana.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There is currently a large community of developers working to build a decompiler for BPF. Decompilers translate machine code back into human readable code. Institutional investors want that transparency. They want to know what is happening when they sign transactions with their wallet. Hackers want to see that code because thats how the reverse engineer exploits.  (&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Philologist are piecing together clues to understand how the ancient tribes communicated. They believe history will unlock the secrets of the blockchain.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When someone finally nails this down, smart contracts will become open source. All the contracts written by crappy developers that skipped proper validation will be instantly exposed before retail even wakes up. They will likely launch a blockchain scanner similar to Ethereum, where anyone can read the contracts on-chain. This is why institutional investors use Ethereum. They can audit the code in full transparency. Hackers find exploits by looking through code to see where developers overlooked risk. Solana security is a vail. (&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;If hackers discover these secrets first, they will destroy the blockchain, stealing all the treasure within.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is a recipe for disaster. Open source is a critical part of crypto, especially when it comes to smart contracts. Code is law? That doesn&amp;amp;#39;t matter if you make it difficult to read the law? Thats not security. The system has never had the opportunity to be truly battle tested when there were less consequences on the table. They have too much TVL right now. It&amp;amp;#39;s literally begging to be tested. (&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Purists are warning that we must not tamper with the blockchain, fearing it will open Pandoras Box causing death and destruction to all&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“Not your keys, not your crypto” is definitely a mantra chanted over and over again in this sun-reddit but I’m of the opinion it is not for everybody. In fact, not for the large majority of retailer users, and that includes many of us here. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So many people lose their keys or coins the moment they take it off exchanges. They get hacked, scammed, phished or even physically robbed in real life - It happens a lot. You hear about it without fail every single week in this sub reddit.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The attack vectors for cold wallets are plenty as well, from the day you received it is it a compromised or fake hardware device? Did you download the right software? Every time you updated the software, did you update the legitimate software for your hardware token? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Even after you’ve set up, the attacks are ongoing… What if you download a malware in the future on your desktop, dusting attacks, accidentally interacting with a malicious smart contract.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Physically, the risk is there. Your seed phrase on the metal sheet can be stolen in a break in. You could lose your seed in a fire, or it gets compromised in someway. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;More gets lost in self-custody than on exchanges.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I’m of the opinion, it is wiser to spread your crypto in the top CEX like Coinbase, binance, Kraken, Gemini and FTX. Secure it with 2FA, 3FA, 4FA with one of them being a physical key like the yubikey.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It doesnt look like they have an OTC deal in place, so they are instead moving all of that to their FTX deposit wallet&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/ddzhvwyzb5a91.jpg?width=1396&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=38e3bfa801973700f88c67b6401bcb9adb9eb888&quot;&amp;gt;500m worth BTC about to hit markets&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After fucking up so epicly in the last 2 months, its atleast encouraging to see them do a test transaction of 0.01 BTC..&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It looks like a big liquidation is underway in Celsius and they may also be declaring bankruptcy and announcing insolvency proceedings soon&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;DeFiyst has been tracking every move!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Update: the $500m BTC is still in Celsius&amp;amp;#39; main wallet here and hasnt yet been moved to FTX:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://etherscan.io/address/0x019C4935ff1c4945f046c6784c08a40f1ab632a3&quot;&amp;gt;https://etherscan.io/address/0x019C4935ff1c4945f046c6784c08a40f1ab632a3&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They haven&amp;amp;#39;t yet moved this stack of 24.4k BTC to the FTX wallet. Since they moved the test 0.001 BTC, its speculated that they may move this too shortly.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you check the wallet&amp;amp;#39;s erc20 txn tab, you can see that they have moved a lot of their tokens like ZRX, BNT, Comp etc to their main FTX wallet, probably to sell it. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now the wallet mainly has 24,400 wBTC ($511,000,000) + some Comp worth 50k&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Update 2:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The wBTC just moved...  &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://etherscan.io/tx/0x84a4bd54e9ce7d322544a0a8110232b37eb3bb4b1a486835891b6213a43fda56&quot;&amp;gt;https://etherscan.io/tx/0x84a4bd54e9ce7d322544a0a8110232b37eb3bb4b1a486835891b6213a43fda56&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crema finance is a decentralised liquidity protocol based on Solana.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It offers a solution to illiquid markets by offering rewards to liquidity providers to swap illiquid cryptocurrencies.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Hack Recap&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The exploiter found a vulnerability in its tick size and activated six flash loans worth around $8.78 millon.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The attacker swapped the stolen fund into 69422.9 SOL and 6,497,738 USDCet via Jupiter. Then, the USDCet was bridged to the Ethereum network with the help of Wormhole and swapped to 6,064ETH via Uniswap soon after.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Crema team messaged to the hackers ethereum address on-chain:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;“To the Crema hacker: Your address on both Solana and Ethereum have been blacklisted and all eyes are on you right now. You have 72h from now to consider becoming a white hat and keeping $800k as a bounty. And transfer remaining funds back to our contract-update-authority address.
&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The hacker agreed to return the funds and kept 45455 SOL as Bounty.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
