If anything, I am buying more as I have not invested more than I can afford to lose so I don&amp;amp;#39;t care what happens.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Of course nobody wants to lose money but you have to decide. Imagine you sell now and later this year we break 100k. I would rather lose all my money than not being invested once this happens. The risk of NOT holding is just too high in my opinion.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto is the only chance to achieve financial freedom and escape the hamster wheel we are all stuck in. I am gladly taking the risk for this possibility. If the money is gone, nothing changes anyway and we keep hamster wheeling.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto was supposed to be decentralized so it would not have a single entity controlling it. We would not be bond to the whims of a single centralized government or private entity.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And as of late i&amp;amp;#39;ve seen crypto being controlled by the fed. They say they will print more crypto pumps, they say they will print less crypto dumps. This is the same as the stock market and it&amp;amp;#39;s a shame because it defeats the sole porpuse of decentralization.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you think the fed will ever fight inflation think again&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/ypt6qrxr98b81.png?width=770&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=d53e7d664544a3fa7e501f82d9926a4902962655&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/ypt6qrxr98b81.png?width=770&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=d53e7d664544a3fa7e501f82d9926a4902962655&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;1921- &amp;amp;quot;In the 19th century, deflationary periods were the result of an increase in production, rather than a decrease in demand. During the Great Depression, deflation was the result of &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;a collapsing financial sector and bank failures&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. &amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Demand is higher and production is slower, there&amp;amp;#39;s news everywhere of cars unable to be sold because they lack chips.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This pandemic hit most supply chains everywhere, and that&amp;amp;#39;s until it&amp;amp;#39;s normalized there will be more demand for some products than actual production.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Maybe in a couple of years while normalizing the supply chain we will actually produce more than demand requires and it will be 1921 all over again....&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;1930 -  &amp;amp;quot;During the Great Depression, deflation was the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;result of a collapsing financial sector and bank failures&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. The deflation that took place at the outset of the Great Depression was the most dramatic that the U.S. has ever experienced. Prices dropped an average of ten percent every year between the years of 1930 and 1933. &amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Prices drop 10% a year is something that won&amp;amp;#39;t stimulate the economy, ask yourself why would you buy a car worth 10k when next year it will be 9k or a house. People would spend much less because saving was making them money.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is something the economy can&amp;amp;#39;t afford right now, many companies are barely surviving and the least they need is people to be willing to spend less money because they don&amp;amp;#39;t want to spend their savings which are increasing in value.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto should be an edge against inflation which is rampant and most likely never tackled with, printing is done there&amp;amp;#39;s no way they will reverse course.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;No matter what the fed says I doubt they will actually go for deflationary policy. They might print less.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Look at Obama&amp;amp;#39;s term he started with 2008 crash the housing crash!!!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;8 years of Obama&amp;amp;#39;s term with good economy and yet the fed didn&amp;amp;#39;t increase rates. Only when Trump became president did they started increasing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So if we take into account the same we still have 6 years left of Joe Biden with covid crisis, if he lives that long., with no rate hike.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Resume: Crypto will always be an edge against inflation which will never be tackled, No matter what the fed says crypto should do it&amp;amp;#39;s own thing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I fear more rampant inflation and the hit on my savings than a crypto crash, because crypto proved to me it can recover, and my savings are still worth less and less.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Silence&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Me: The following: Imagine investing 100€ in Ethereum. The price goes up by 20%. Now I have 120€. If I now sell and buy again - and disregard the transaction fees - and the price rises again by 20%, I am at 144€. If I had not sold, it would have risen by 40% and I would only have 140€. Understand?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;LOUD SILENCE IN THE DISCORD CHAT&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Friend 1: Is it just me who thinks this is incredibly stupid?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Friend 2,3,4: No Nope Nah, that makes absolutely no sense &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I (slowly despairing🥲), think to myself that I could have saved the transaction fees, which are astronomical with Coinbase anyway, for one thing, and that from now on the story will be held in front of me again and again if I don&amp;amp;#39;t manage to clarify it now. So I try to explain the thing again and already during this I realize that it sounds really dumb.
My friends laugh at me and I cry (mentally).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The first and probably most specific to crypto is that he wasn&amp;amp;#39;t against stablecoins continuing to exist even if they began to issue a CBDC USD-meaning there&amp;amp;#39;s less of a threat that stablecoins would suddenly collapse from a ban which would be very destabilizing for the crypto ecosystem.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The second was that he (in passing) spoke of likely allowing bonds to expire off but he specified that this would probably be towards the end of the year-so this is basically quantitative tightening since they wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t be continuing to hold the same amount of bonds since they wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t be buying any more. I think there was some fear originally that they would start doing the rate hikes plus tightening all at once in March.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Of course overall he&amp;amp;#39;s still talking about planning for at least 3 hikes this year plus the tightening so it&amp;amp;#39;s not like he went all out in favor of easy money, but basically it wasn&amp;amp;#39;t the worst case scenario that was driving a lot of fear in recent days.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now I guess we wait patiently for the CPI numbers tomorrow-the two bullish scenarios for Bitcoin would be either lower than expected numbers causing the Fed to reduce the number of hikes or further delay tightening, or if the numbers are so freaking crazy that people think the Fed cannot control inflation at all. That said, I don&amp;amp;#39;t think either are particularly super likely scenarios. If it comes in about what everyone is expecting or a little bit hotter then they&amp;amp;#39;ll hike rates and tighten as planned. Whether that really is going to further impact Bitcoin is unclear-we&amp;amp;#39;re already down 40% and while we&amp;amp;#39;ve drawn down 80% in the past it&amp;amp;#39;s also a much more mature asset class now and there&amp;amp;#39;s global exposure so it&amp;amp;#39;s not solely US policy driving price.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TL;DR: Powell said stablecoins A-OK, will still hike rates soon but likely tightening not until Q3-Q4. Not worst case scenario feared.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;ve watched on-chain data for years. I&amp;amp;#39;d argue that currently, it&amp;amp;#39;s the most bullish I&amp;amp;#39;ve ever seen it, and the micro backdrop looks the same. I&amp;amp;#39;m calling for $500k in the next 12 months. Longterm holders are in a longterm uptrend, while short-term holders are in a longterm downtrend. When you consider the halving we had in 2020 (which means only 6.25 coinbase per block), the rise of commercial mining (which means huge amounts of HODL&amp;amp;#39;ed bitcoin), the parabolic growth of the LN (which means ever increasing amounts of BTC locked in nodes), the explosion of hard wallets (Trezor will give you 13% off if you wait to buy yours, and Ledger tripled its capacity), the possibility of spot ETF&amp;amp;#39;s (which means pension, IRA, and institutional exposure), that 90% of all BTC has already been mined  (the last 10% will take over 100 years to mine), etcetera, there&amp;amp;#39;s not much time left until we reach the counterpoint. That&amp;amp;#39;s where governments, financial institutions, and wealthy families late to the inevitability compete for the last large tracts of UTXO space on the blockchain, and bring the type of volatility the gold/papiermark enjoyed, before bitcoin&amp;amp;#39;s transactional (currency) epoch arrives:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/dtjkna3cb6b81.png?width=601&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=3c5a310fb1c2c31678582e086a9bd05b54236542&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/dtjkna3cb6b81.png?width=601&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=3c5a310fb1c2c31678582e086a9bd05b54236542&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On the micro side, all the publicly listed bitcoin companies (miners, FinCen etcetera), are at exhausted RSI&amp;amp;#39;s and trading at or below 52-week lows. The perp funding rates are negative. Futures ETF&amp;amp;#39;s have been in a consistent downtrend since November. The fear and greed index reached multi-year lows two days ago. Too, the massive amount of Asian selling is drying up (Huobi alone dumped 350k coins over the last quarter and several exchanges dumped all their Chinese customers). But you&amp;amp;#39;d never know any of this from the story on-chain data is trying to tell us that dumb money isn&amp;amp;#39;t heeding:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/stqgygmyb6b81.jpg?width=1800&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=78ae90722bc8c98455aef5e353d922f4e7a49591&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/stqgygmyb6b81.jpg?width=1800&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=78ae90722bc8c98455aef5e353d922f4e7a49591&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/p7bjjtv7c6b81.jpg?width=640&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=a10a5ca31e4c4e6028b53172221bd5f3649bf758&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/p7bjjtv7c6b81.jpg?width=640&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=a10a5ca31e4c4e6028b53172221bd5f3649bf758&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So for me, I&amp;amp;#39;m going to follow the subtext, and not listen to the noise. I&amp;amp;#39;m going to trust the math. I&amp;amp;#39;m going all-in with my dip money which I usually keep at 5% of my BTC holdings. I&amp;amp;#39;ll do so un-hedged, and prepare a loan on my BTC in the event one of the below FUD&amp;amp;#39;s drives us down briefly.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;FINAL FUD&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There are 3 potential FUD&amp;amp;#39;s this year, and after, there won&amp;amp;#39;t be anymore, ever.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Regulation. This will obliterate altcoins and almost all stablecoins.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Mt. Gox distribution date&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Russian invasion of Ukraine. This could spike energy prices, clobber mining&amp;amp;#39;s economy of scale, and force distribution of several miner&amp;amp;#39;s holdings to pay overhead. Kazakhstan produces energy at .04-.05 cents per kWh, which is about the cheapest in the world and has 20% of the hash power for example. Adding .01 to that is extremely severe.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitcoin will pivot off all of this quickly.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

All these metaverse games, Sandbox (yes, I know its in alpha, but still) and Decentraland feel like cheap Roblox clones, except that you can buy some virtual land for real housing money?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thats not what we got promised. I know that these projects are not associated with Facebook, but then, can you consider them a virtual world? If Roblox introduced a real estate mechanic, would it make Roblox a metaverse? Probably not.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So the debate is, what exactly is the &amp;amp;quot;metaverse&amp;amp;quot; ? Collection of crypto roblox games, or an actual virtual world?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And as much as they are supporters of cryptocurrencies, 99% of people do it to have more money in fiat currencies so they can achieve their goals.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When trading with cryptocurrencies, we compare their value with the euro, dollar, pound, etc.  Currently we are comparing the value of everything to our current fiat price.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;An international financial system such as crypto takes time to adapt and I can only imagine what awaits us in the future, but I belive that even then we will still compare value with traditional currencies.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The main goal of crypto is decentralization. We all want it, yet when we take profit we take it from centralized place. Stablecoins are backed by traditional currencies, which are again centralized.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fast forward to today and bitcoin is the new Nintendo, it has owned and still owns the lions share of the crypto market. Most people have heard of it and probably think all crypto IS just bitcoin. Now people refer to everything as a &amp;amp;#39;coin&amp;amp;#39; no matter what it actually is.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;DCA + smash buying helps soothe emotional volatility.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Have a plan and stick to it. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The mainstream news is always hilariously wrong about bitcoin.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Shitcoins are a high risk / high reward proposition.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;DONT TRADE. But If you are going to trade you need to measure your performance in bitcoin terms. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Mining is a profession, not a hobby. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Frugality is paramount. If people aren’t laughing at your lifestyle, you probably aren’t hodling or stacking hard enough.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Bitcoin maximalist.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Dude lives in 2012 and still believes that all coins that aren’t bitcoin are scams. He can’t see value in any other project outside bitcoin and worship people like Michael Saylor. Brags about understanding Austrian school of economics but never really read Mises. Constantly makes comparisons about energy use of bitcoin vs banks and gold.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The ethereum dude.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He isn’t a maximalist and actually enjoy other projects, but thinks that ethereum is king. Consider the first mover advantage eth has over smart contracts too much to be overcome by other coins. Keep his coins at the exchange for obvious reasons.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The Cardano geek.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Usually they follow Charles Hoskinson like a cult. Live in a completely isolated world where all that exists is Cardano. They read through each whitepaper but never read about other projects outside of Cardano. They constantly brag about how Cardano is safe due to Haskell and how fast it can become with Hydra. Don’t really do anything with his Cardano, since there’s nothing to do.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The solana cheated wife.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He knows the network is centralized. He knows it keeps getting offline. He knows how bad the initial token distribution was. But since he gained some money in Solana, he is always looking for explanations about Solana problems and bragging about a zillion tps.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The obsessed trader.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He can’t hold one coin for over one month. He’s always checking his charts and always getting hyped about new coins. He says he’s into crypto for the long term but his average holding period is one week. Usually loses money.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The CRO boomer.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Uses the debit card and stake. Believes that CRO will be huge. Don’t understand much about crypto in general, but usually has lots of money and stake all his CRO to get shiny metal cards.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The moonshooter.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He’s always looking for the “next big thing” and very susceptible to YouTubers and influencers. Constantly shill his shitcoins at Reddit and social media. Usually loses money&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The FUDster.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The crash is always incoming and he’s always afraid of losing all his money. Deep down he believes that crypto is a Ponzi scheme. Usually he’s at mid-age and hide his crypto investments from his wife. Every 10% dip he thinks the world is gonna end. Constantly talks about Tether.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Buy high and sell low.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He knows the theory but can’t help to the opposite. He always FOMO at ATH and paperhand sell at lows. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The hodler.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He doesn’t really know much about tech details about the projects he invest in. He doesn’t take profits nor take losses. He doesn’t try to time the market. He just hodl. But that doesn’t stop him from getting hyped up when he has unrealized gains and extremely worried when he has unrealized losses.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Do you know anyone that are in these stereotypes ?

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yep. I think about this constantly, I understand the use case for something like Bitcoin. Transfer money with no middle men. I get that. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What the hell are these other chains supposed to be doing? Half my damn portfolio is Ethereum and I genuinely can&amp;amp;#39;t tell you what your supposed to do with it. Why would you develop an app on a Blockchain? Let alone how. Is there some inherent benefit here? God I have no clue. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For the longest time I just thought it was like providing a decentralized version of something like AWS or Azure, like a grass roots server host. Holy shit I was wrong. There&amp;amp;#39;s all sorts of shit you can make apparently. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But yeah idk. Feels good to come clean. I got into it cause it seemed like a smart investment and so far so good. But I&amp;amp;#39;m amazed I&amp;amp;#39;ve not come across any real application of it in my day to day life so far that I&amp;amp;#39;m aware of at least. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I cannot be alone here right? Please. It&amp;amp;#39;s wild to me that I understand more about the idea behind what an NFT is (supposed to be) used for than any application of any other blockchains. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Idk if anyone else is in this camp and feels dumb you&amp;amp;#39;re not alone. I feel ya.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I eventually got into a good DCA schedule but that’s when the May crash happened and I ended up down a lot. I kept buying but I definitely felt sad, defeated, like I might not see my money again for 3-4 years. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This used to emotionally affect me a lot. I’d stare at charts all day, wake up at 3am and panic sell, or panic buy. Looking back those short term price swings didn’t matter. All those trades did was made my taxes super complicated to calculate. No matter how many posts I read saying this, the experience of going through it yourself is where you learn the most. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now I’ve finally reached the point where I am not emotionally affected at all, and it feels amazing. If the price goes up? I have enough invested that I’d be happy with the profits. If the price goes down? I have another potentially life changing opportunity to load up on more crypto. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TLDR: Good opportunities are ahead, whether the price goes up or down in the short term&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Like many of you, I bought this delicious dip. I&amp;amp;#39;m out of money now, but I have an average ETH buy price of $2984...which I think is pretty good. I&amp;amp;#39;m hodling this for the intermediate term because I expect the price of ETH to rise as the date for ETH 2.0 (a.k.a. The Merge) draws nearer. Any ETH traders that are shorting right now should definitely make sure you close out before the date is confirmed because the hype will come on fast and you&amp;amp;#39;ll get rekt. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Naturally, there could be another delay in the launch which, to be fair, would not be great. But if you check out the number of commits on github for ETH 2 clients, many reference improvements to clients for the merge which tells me the devs are working hard at it. I like it!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The signs were there that the project was dead. But I was fooled by getting an entry 50% below ATH, and seeing a quick 50% gain followed by a slow rug. So I held way past  being reasonably certain it was dead. Plus it was shilled by a crypto guy who led me to other actual gems, but I guess it&amp;amp;#39;s true that everyone is a genius in a bull run.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Honorable mention to my friend who fomod into eth in May at 4400, sold for a loss then bought around 4k more recently and sold for a loss again. RIP.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hope this helps everyone feel a little better for the state of affairs we&amp;amp;#39;re all in. What&amp;amp;#39;s your worst crypto story?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: I hope we can all take solace and find solidarity in the fact that most of us have made mistakes and poor choices. And maybe even reflect on what led us to those choices. This game rewards risk takers, and we&amp;amp;#39;re all just one yolo away from a lambo, I think. Not car advice.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thanks for sharing everyone.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit 2: besides obvious (in hindsight) rugs and shitcoins, the most common worst choices are VET, fomoing doge and shib, fomoing CRO (also guilty of this) and buying ADA at peak. And ICP. We&amp;amp;#39;ll do better next time homies.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
