&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Currently it is in beta and not offered to all users. It is a subscription service that costs $29.99/month and will waive all trading fees on the app(still could be effected by spread) and it will protect your account against unauthorized access up to $1,000,000 worth. It also says 24/7 customer phone support too.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I don&amp;amp;#39;t see myself using this since I hardly buy on the app and use cb pro for my crypto buys. Even with the 0.5% fee and spread fee I would need to be buying at least $6000 in non stablecoin crypto to make it worth the monthly subscription fee.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The added protection is a good selling point though that makes me consider it since I mainly keep about $2000 in USDC on there to pay my bills with their coinbase card for the 4% cashback. Knowing that my card/funds are safe from unauthorized hacks is nice. I&amp;amp;#39;m not one to be hacked though and haven&amp;amp;#39;t had any issues with my CB account in the 4-5 years I have had it and the 9~ months I have had the card&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;India missed out on leading the world in the 90s with the internet. India will once again miss out on leading the world in Bitcoin and crypto innovation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I read the Indian Finance Minister saying the tax laws are supposed to discourage gambling in crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Well congrats! With your ignorance and short sighted thinking you have just screwed your country out of the biggest opportunity to turn India into a first world country and global superpower.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Will any Bitcoin and crypto startup invest in India now? No chance in hell! You will lose trillions of dollars of investments and even more brain power will leave India and support foreign economies.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I feel sorry for people in India. You should look to move to progressive countries that are not afraid of innovation and have the courage to lead.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The HODL meter takes into consideration the current global monetary policy, the current market trend in different markets, macroeconomic situation worldwide, and consumer perception.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Moreover, if you are mining, you cannot treat the mining infrastructure investment as costs. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This nonsense is on top of a flat 30% capital gains taxes and 1% TDS. Moreover, as per the full laws, you cannot carry forward losses to another year as well. Now it seems even in the same year, you cannot adjust it with gains from another asset. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The government is on a path of de-facto killing crypto by over regulation. If you make the taxes so high and the compliance so expensive, no one will ever invest in crypto - that seems to be the thought process of this utter shit government. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

@peter_szilagyi
Mar 18  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Complexity is an often overlooked aspect of a system because usually someone else is paying the price for it, not the person creating it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But don&amp;amp;#39;t be mistaken, someone &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;is&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; paying the price - whether money, time or mental capacity. They might not be willing/able to do forever.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As with scalability, complexity also keeps trickling unseen up to the breaking point. At that time, it&amp;amp;#39;s already past the point of no return.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Complexity also has the nasty effect of causing cascading failures. Overload people too much, lose capacity, leading to even larger load.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In #Ethereum&amp;amp;#39;s history, complexity never decreased. Every EIP is piling on top. Every major change (1559, merge, sharding, verkle, stateless, L2, etc) is one more nail.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m extremely frustrated when a research proposal says &amp;amp;quot;everything&amp;amp;#39;s figured out, it&amp;amp;#39;s just engineering now&amp;amp;quot;.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As good as it feels that we&amp;amp;#39;re approaching The Merge, I must emphasize that #Ethereum is not going in a clean direction. Tangentially it&amp;amp;#39;s achieving results, but it&amp;amp;#39;s also piling complexity like there&amp;amp;#39;s no tomorrow.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If the protocol doesn&amp;amp;#39;t get slimmer, it&amp;amp;#39;s not going to make it.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I feel the root cause is the disconnect between the research and the dev teams. The former has to &amp;amp;quot;only&amp;amp;quot; dream up elegant - standalone - ideas.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The latter needs to juggle every single idea that was ever introduced, whilst surgically expanding the dimensionality of the space.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There have been engineering attempts to reduce the complexity (module split in Erigon, responsibility split in The Merge). Yet there was never an attempt to reduce the protocol complexity.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We are already past the point of anyone having a full picture of the system. This is bad.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I can&amp;amp;#39;t say what the solution is, but my 2c is to stop adding features and start culling, even at the expense of breaking things.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There are less and less people knowing and willing to piece together a broken network. And each change pushes more away. /FIN  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Being the &amp;amp;#39;crypto guy&amp;amp;#39; is a good way to become the loser or the annoying guy in the group.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I don&amp;amp;#39;t know what it is about crypto that makes people who devote their whole persona and personality to it such annoying douchebags. It&amp;amp;#39;s much more prominent with NFT guys online, but it&amp;amp;#39;s true for crypto as well. It just gives you a bad name, and I don&amp;amp;#39;t think being the crypto guy is conductive to anything good in social situations. It just makes you look like a loser, and more often than not you are one if you make crypto your whole personality.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Just my two cents. Some people could really stand to calm down a bit with crypto as their personality.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Price Analysis:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The price fluctuates with the DeFi market, outperforming the Defi Index (&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;DEFIPERP, FTX&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;) significantly during from Jan 2020 to Nov 2021.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The price significantly rose after rumors of a GME partnership, however, this has not yet materialized resulting in the price to underperform the Defi Index and underperformon positive news around fundamentals (i.e. wallet release, large amount of traded volume, etc…)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The below graph outlines some news articles and previous project milestones (note: this is nowhere near exhaustive):&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/xr09fpvgqmo81.png?width=2642&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=272f233de91423f101887e54d8b2d653a31c3f06&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/xr09fpvgqmo81.png?width=2642&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=272f233de91423f101887e54d8b2d653a31c3f06&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Runway:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Two funding rounds (2017 &amp;amp;amp; 2018) raised 45 Million from a total of 10 investors. No post-ICO funding has been provided.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;As per the vesting schedule tokens are locked for two years after ICO (were locked until Aug 2019) and then were released monthly over a two month period (i.e. until Aug 2021). Note that allocation to investors had no lockup.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Ongoing Development:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Although there is no clear roadmap with definitive dates for 2022 the following development items are highlighted for a 2022 release:

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Continuing to invest resource into the NFT space including Counterfactual NFT&amp;amp;#39;s&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Loopring HQ releasing in Decentraland&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;More direct bridges to LRC (easier to move funds in and out)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Multi-layered wallet&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Loopring DAO&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Loopring/&quot;&amp;gt;https://github.com/Loopring/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; is active&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Developers are active&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Community:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Google trends for &amp;amp;quot;Loopring&amp;amp;quot; worldwide over the last 12 months is showing steadily decreased interest since the GME partnership rumor&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/ks1uf1gzqmo81.png?width=2583&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=a6d7bc145c0889c980278598658755f5f2bba8d7&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/ks1uf1gzqmo81.png?width=2583&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=a6d7bc145c0889c980278598658755f5f2bba8d7&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Loopring has an active community:

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Discord: &amp;amp;gt;20,000 Members [exact number not stated]&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Reddit: 98.2K Members&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Twitter: 186.5 K Followers&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Large proportion of the community was brought in during the GME rumor and this is reflected in the posts and conversaiton&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Tokenomics:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Deflationary programmatic burn with a capped supply.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Max supply is 1.37 Billion and 97% of this is circulating&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Overall (&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;disclaimer: this is my analysis of the above information&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;This is a solid project in relation to L2 solutions.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The transition into the NFT space is in line with the original product  niche (i.e. offering low cost solutions to L1&amp;amp;#39;s)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The GME announcement significantly skewed the crypto price with zero fundamentals backing it up. This in turn overshadowed fundamental improvements to the project in later days.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We all dream that we don&amp;amp;#39;t have to go to work, but that we have enough money for a quality life and the costs of life when you have a family.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you don&amp;amp;#39;t already have a lot of money, if you are not already rich, then how can you live on passive income? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It takes a lot of luck, effort and work to reach a level where a person can say that he no longer has to work and that he can live freely from passive income. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The real question is how to get that passive income.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What exactly is passive income?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Mining is one of the ways of passive income, but even here you have to buy quality equipment, take care of it, be there if needed, if there is a power outage or something like that. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you get crazy rich by trading cryptocurrencies, then you can stake that crypto, but only if you succeed in that, and that is not easy.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Let me repeat myself - Satoshi’s creation of a digital peer to peer electronic monetary network was created and has run soundly for 12+ years - anyone can buy it - anyone can send any amount they have to others without external influence or control.        &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One can send anyone money anywhere in the world - takes just under 10minutes to settle - no bank wire fee - no fiat conversion fee - it’s amazing that this system was invented.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This indicates that the overall momentum of the NFT market is weakening, and supply is catching up to dropping demand. We&amp;amp;#39;ll see fewer $300k Monkeys JPEGs, and things will begin to slow down now that it&amp;amp;#39;s becoming more difficult to flip the NFTs for a bigger sucker to buy in.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So, what does this mean for ordinary crypto enthusiasts like myself and you?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The altcoin season is approaching. Not to note that, despite the fact that their NFT barrier of entry is decreasing, gaming tokens are anticipated to surge.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And this reality might not be too far away from happening. We’re already seeing things like crypto credit cards from platforms like Binance, Coinbase and CoinOvy gaining a lot of popularity in the mainstream market.
