&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Low and behold the culprit is &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://robinhood.com/&quot;&amp;gt;r&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;obinhood. I literally used them for 2 months, realized I did not like the platform, then the GME and AMC bullshit and the shady practices with the hedge fund, then the wallet bullshit where you couldn&amp;amp;#39;t sell your crypto. After all that it just made me hate them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;People are already getting notices asking to explain their crypto activity, and being asked to submit all evidence including all your bank statements from several past years. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The govt is asking you to explain all your crypto activities and track all your wallets. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These activities are an illegal exercise conducted by the government where the centralised exchanges are playing along, violating the right to privacy of citizens. The law protects people against unauthorised searches and seizures, without any warrant. Users of CEX are not performing any illegal activity, and there is no probable cause to effect seizure of everyone&amp;amp;#39;s data. Yet the CEX have happily turned over people&amp;amp;#39;s data to the government, who is now coming after crypto traders. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is possible that one or two users may engage in illegal activity, but that does not allow the government to seize everyone&amp;amp;#39;s data under suspicion. These are draconian violations of privacy.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At such situations where everyone is just so sad that they can&amp;amp;#39;t even watch the charts anymore or even talk about Crypto. That&amp;amp;#39;s when you know we are truely in some bearish sentiment. But a bearish sentiment is probably the best thing, as the bears become very overconfident that everything is under control but in Crypto nothing every is in anyone&amp;amp;#39;s hands.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also looking at the history the past big bull runs started after everyone was not even thinking about a pump but just about a further dumb. One thing to akwys remember is that a bear run only happens when we can not imagine it going down any day soon and a bulk run happens when we can not imagine it going up any time soon.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now this is probably going on with every major Centralized exchange due to the fact that people are greedy and will take advantage of any opportunity to make more money. what  options do we have?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I have some stuff on Conbase and am planning on moving it to a non-custodial wallet this week, I had planned to leave it in Conbase to be able to sell easily but with the way the past couple of months have gone I&amp;amp;#39;m just going to hold it for a while. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Learn to think critically and for once, to actually be impartial to whatever bags you may or may not have. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A recent example is the supposed &amp;amp;quot;delay&amp;amp;quot; in Ethereum&amp;amp;#39;s merge. You can&amp;amp;#39;t delay something that never had an agreed upon date. Rather then saying it how is, with Ethereum devs getting closer to a finalized date for the merge, misleading titles get upvoted by people seeking confirmation bias rather then trying to understand what is actually going on in the development process. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It applies to Cardano the same way it applies to Ethereum and any other project. You&amp;amp;#39;ll never succeed in crypto if you keep trying to prove your biases right and refuse to see things for what they actually are. A successful investor considers facts rather then personal feelings.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Let me get that straight.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I always thought I invested only what I can &amp;amp;#39;afford&amp;amp;#39; to lose. I did not need the money at that time and I was working so I had a steady income as well.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When prices started dropping I realized I was checking the charts quite a lot. It was the last thing I did before going to sleep and the first thing I did when I woke up. The prices going down were nagging at me a lot more than I anticipated at first.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I decided to take out my initial investment and some extra profits if I wanted to go on a vacation with some friends. Since I did that, I barely check the charts anymore and to be honest I feel no stress at all when prices drop.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This made me wonder how many of you their mental health truly stays unaffected by the prices dropping and truly invested only what you can &amp;amp;#39;afford&amp;amp;#39; to lose?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit 1: I’m trying to reply to everyone but damn you all are going hard with the replies!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit 2: I agree “afford” to lose is a really ambiguous and weird term. That’s why I put it between brackets!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

It offers numerous services to cryptocurrency investors and other market players. According to DeFi LIama, the total locked-in value (TVL) in DeFi protocols today is $209.2 billion. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;From lending and borrowing to yield farming, from high APY staking protocols to margin trading, DeFi is ultimately transforming into one of the most desirable, go-to solutions for private investors, institutions, crypto VCs and retailers. With so many new, alternative value propositions being architected on almost a daily basis, DeFi is set to become the quintessential disruptor of 21st century finance. Due to its importance, this post will touch on an aspect of DeFi, which is lending. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cryptocurrency trading and speculation is at the heart of cryptocurrency lending. There is a high demand for cryptocurrency borrowing because hedge funds and a number of investors have found that they can make money by betting leveraged on tokens and crypto derivatives. Because these players can make significant amounts with their trading strategies, they can afford to pay intermediaries high rates for borrowing cryptocurrency. And today often a large number of investors and traders trade their assets in pair to stablecoins like Binance USD, Teather, USD Coin. These payments, net of profits, go to regular crypto investors in the form of returns that far exceed what they would get from bank deposits. Defi lending platforms aim to offer crypto loans in a trustless manner, i.e., without intermediaries. A borrower can directly take a loan through the decentralized platform. Among all of the decentralized applications (DApps), Defi has the highest lending growth rate and is the most prevalent contributor for locking crypto assets. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the past few years, the marketplace has seen even more valuable and innovative decentralized lending platforms. The ability to lend and borrow assets among completely open applications has created a fundamental breakthrough for the future of finance and cryptocurrency.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here are some of the topmost decentralized lending platforms you should know about.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;1. Aave&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is an open-source and one of the most popular Defi lending protocols launched in 2020. It is a non-custodial liquidity protocol for earning interests on deposit and borrowing assets. This platform allows lenders to deposit cryptocurrencies in a pool and receive an equivalent amount of aTokens. Aave algorithmically adjusts interest rates depending on demand and supply. It indicates that the more the user holds aTokens, the better the interest amount.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If users are looking to use the Aave protocol, users first deposit the chosen asset and amount. Shortly after, the lender will earn passive income based on the market borrowing demand. Additionally, depositing assets allows consumers the ability to borrow by using the deposited assets as collateral. The interest you earn by depositing funds may help offset the interest rate users accumulate by borrowing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/ja8uolr5a9t81.png?width=2880&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e7a711330665be2c031cdfd2876b5755ed0cd52b&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/ja8uolr5a9t81.png?width=2880&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e7a711330665be2c031cdfd2876b5755ed0cd52b&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Aave offers users many advantages. Financial protocols boast transparency, and that benefits many users. When it comes to lending and borrowing, everything is clear and straightforward, even for those new to the cryptocurrency market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You don&amp;amp;#39;t have to think about the processes we see in traditional systems that don&amp;amp;#39;t allow access to their processes. They use your funds in a way that benefits them, but they don&amp;amp;#39;t want to share the profits with you. However, Aave exposes your processes to your community so you know everything that&amp;amp;#39;s going on in the network.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some features of Aave:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;1) Aave is an open-source project&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The good thing about open source code is that many people look at it and work tirelessly to keep it free of vulnerabilities.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;2) Variety of credit pools&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can choose from 10 markets, each offering a different APY and a selection of different coins.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;3) Aave does not store cryptocurrencies&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This benefit is great for investors who worry about hackers. Because the protocol uses a &amp;amp;quot;non-storage&amp;amp;quot; approach to its transactions, users are safe. Even if a cybercriminal breaks into the network, he/she cannot steal the cryptocurrency because there is nothing to steal.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;4) Aave protocol is a private&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Like other decentralized protocols, Aave does not require KYC / AML (know your customer and anti-money laundering) filings. The platforms do not work with intermediaries. Thus, all of these processes become unnecessary. Users who keep their privacy above all else can invest in the platform without compromising themselves.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;2. Alchemix&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Alchemix is a DeFi loan-based platform that uses a new method to provide loans that “pay themselves back over time.” Users deposit DAI into a smart contract. In exchange, users receive a token that represents the deposit’s future yield farming potential. The token used through Alchemix is known as alUSD, which can be transmuted for DAI within the Alchemix platform and traded on a given DeFi exchange.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Once funds are deposited, the funds are used to generate income, which will eventually automatically repay the user&amp;amp;#39;s debt . However, there are several ways in which the user can manage their credit:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Option 1: leave their deposit to earn income all the time, allowing them to periodically withdraw the collateral on the loan.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Option 2: Repay the loan early using alUSD or DAI, allowing them to remove the collateral&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Option 3: liquidate their loan using some of their collateral to pay off the loan and allow them to withdraw what&amp;amp;#39;s left.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/ka1tsx87a9t81.png?width=2880&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=a91fd31a92344396486ffa624efbaa5c5c3adff1&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/ka1tsx87a9t81.png?width=2880&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=a91fd31a92344396486ffa624efbaa5c5c3adff1&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;V1 provided users with a single source of income limiting repayment options. Alchemix version 2 is continually expanding the range of yield options available, making it a key lego in the DeFi stack. If a new app comes along that offers competitive returns, we will be able to quickly capture it, which will be mutually beneficial for both us and the protocol we integrate.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In addition, v2 gives users the ability to determine in detail which yield strategies support their loans, allowing them to create their own yield aggregators on top of Alchemix. More conservative investors can choose safer and more stable yield options, while more aggressive investors may prefer to take more risk by choosing other, less established options with highly variable rates.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some Theses and Features of Alchemix Finance: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;1) Alchemix Synthetic Stablecoin (alUSD)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When users deposit DAI into the Alchemix platform, they receive alUSD in return. As per security measures on the platform, there are limits in place on the amount of alUSD that can be minted from DAI assets.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;2) Vaults&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At the heart of the Alchemix Finance protocol are the vaults, operating through smart contracts. At the moment there are 4 vaults with stablecoins. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;3) Pegging mechanism for synthetic tokens&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All harvested yield flows through the Transmuter, which helps maintain a guaranteed redemption of 1:1 for alUSD and DAI. Moreover, users can choose to stake the synthetic stablecoin in the Transmuter, which will automatically convert yield into the base asset (DAI). When staked, alUSD acts like a bond, eventually maturing into a base asset. When users decide to withdraw their converted DAI, the protocol burns an equivalent amount of the Alchemix stablecoin, alUSD.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;4) Alchemix DAO&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Alchemix decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is a community of enthusiasts working collaboratively to grow and develop the Alchemix ecosystem. The DAO also receives funding through the yield generated through the Alchemix protocol, split between the treasury funds. Whereas the treasury fund is responsible for covering the finances of operations, the Alchemix DAO focuses its funding on development. However, any movement of funds is subject to governance from the DAO. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;3. WOWswap&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;WOWswap is a fully community-owned protocol based on a simple idea: liquidity providers can create a liquidity pool, and traders can borrow these funds to buy up to 5 times more tokens. It is built on Ethereum, Solana, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Binance Smart Chain, IoTeX, Polygon and HECO Chain. Protocol fees, interest rates for lenders and borrowers, liquidation ratios and other settings are decided by holders of WOW tokens — our governance token. Making a WOW swap is as easy as making a regular swap on Uniswap or Pancakeswap — extra capital will be automatically borrowed from the liquidity pool.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When a trader opens a leveraged trading position (long or short), the trader takes a loan from the liquidity pool at a current Hourly Interest Rate (HIR). Therefore, to make leveraged trading possible Liquidity Providers (LP) need to maintain enough liquidity in liquidity pools. Anyone can become a liquidity provider by supplying liquidity to the liquidity pools.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/bidfz9v8a9t81.png?width=2880&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=feef161a9900abcaa9690523e824fdc7ba01fc27&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/bidfz9v8a9t81.png?width=2880&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=feef161a9900abcaa9690523e824fdc7ba01fc27&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Into the second half of 2021, WOWswap had already accomplished much of its initial roadmap, including a liquidation bot, instant governance, a recruitment smart contract, enabled leveraged short swaps, and worked out a DAO governance model. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As a way of maximum capitalization of yields, the platform launched an effective yield aggregator that would allow yield farmers to farm rewards on other DeFi protocols. This is because just a handful of pool tokens are active, while over 75% of the rest remain inactive.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For the platform to improve efficiency around the yield aggregator, the platform will take in rewards from more than one protocol. As a matter of fact, the platform favors highly secure protocols as a means of ensuring funds are protected from cyber terrorists. Remember, DeFi protocols have lost around $14 million to hackers within the last year. Hence, security is paramount to any trading protocol.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The development team found it ideal to allow yield farmers to lend a percentage of their dormant assets and reap more rewards. Thereby, boosting the APY from 10% or 15% to 50%. This implies that traders on WOWswap will gain 50% more in APR compared to other leverage trading protocols.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Besides, the protocol also plans to allow users to burn their tokens and gain rewards.  By executing a successful leverage position on the platform, traders will pay a fee that will automatically represent their vote in community governance. While the fees were currently held in the treasury, presently, they are staked to allow for decentralized voting. Meanwhile, the rest of the tokens are distributed to holders of xWOW.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;WOWswap has a number of features and advantages over competitors:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;1) Successful audit by Hacken&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These audit results showed that there were no critical points in the original smart contract they released and highlighted a few more measures that they took to decrease their already low risks to the barest minimum.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;2) Over 200+ coins for making deals &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Lend your coins to traders and receive reward in the form of interest payments of their trades and also you can open long and short positions yourself using leverage up to 5x. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;3) WOWswap Alerts&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;High APY Alerts, that alert WOWswap users when any of the tokens in the lending pool accumulates 20, 50, or 100% profits. This helps get insights on the most profitable pools to lend to.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;4) WOW Governance Model&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Governance is a mechanism, through which holders of WOW-token can change important protocol’s parameters, as well as submit and accept WOW improvement proposals. Everyone, who participates in the Governance, receives Governance rewards, which calculated as a percentage of the protocol’s total revenue.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;5) xWOW token&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;xWOW token is used for voting and Governance reward distribution. Governance rewards are distributed proportionally among all xWOW holders. Staking by itself is sufficient to get Governance rewards, no actual voting is required.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Conclusion&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This detailed discussion shows that DeFi lending has a high potential to reshape the entire financial system. DeFi lending being involved with the intriguing technology truly has vast opportunities to revolutionize the global financial landscape.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is a pretty big deal. It will lead to a huge chunk of bitcoiners moving away from exchanges and just spending their btc whenever they need to.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This would change behaviour immensely by financially incentivising people to move away from treating bitcoin as an investment on an exchnage to actually spending it as money.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s not wholly unexpected as development always tends to run a little later than original estimates, and it&amp;amp;#39;s also not a bad thing that they are going to take their time to make sure everything goes as smoothly as possible.  This is also not FUD, as anyone who is following the progress on tesnet can attest to there have been many major advances towards The Merge in the last several months.  It&amp;amp;#39;s kind of a running theme in the ETH mining community how proof of stake has been &amp;amp;quot;almost here&amp;amp;quot; for years now, but this time it&amp;amp;#39;s actually true we are nearing the end.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I like ETH, think it&amp;amp;#39;s a great project, and am interested in its development.  A lot of casual ETH investors or miners were thinking The Merge might happen in June of this year, and this is the latest information to show that is unlikely to happen.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) increased 1.2 percent in March on a seasonally adjusted basis after rising 0.8 percent in February, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Over the last 12 months, the all items index increased 8.5 percent before seasonal adjustment.   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Increases in the indexes for gasoline, shelter, and food were the largest contributors to the seasonally adjusted all items increase. The gasoline index rose 18.3 percent in March and accounted for over half of the all items monthly increase; other energy component indexes also increased. The food index rose 1.0 percent and the food at home index rose 1.5 percent.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The index for all items less food and energy rose 0.3 percent in March following a 0.5-percent increase the prior month. The shelter index was by far the biggest factor in the increase, with a broad set of other indexes also contributing, including those for airline fares, household furnishings and operations, medical care, and motor vehicle insurance. In contrast, the index for used cars and trucks fell 3.8 percent over the month.    &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The all items index continued to accelerate, rising 8.5 percent for the 12 months ending March, the largest 12-month increase since the period ending December 1981. The all items less food and energy index rose 6.5 percent, the largest 12-month change since the period ending August 1982. The energy index rose 32.0 percent over the last year, and the food index increased 8.8 percent, the largest 12-month increase since the period ending May 1981.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

I&amp;amp;#39;m having a hard time understanding how &amp;amp;quot;we are in a better place than we were last month&amp;amp;quot; and yet headline inflation is also going to be &amp;amp;quot;extraordinarily elevated.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Full article text:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;by Christian Datoc, White House Reporter  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Biden administration is bracing for inflation to continue its historic rise when the March Consumer Price Index is published Tuesday morning.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters in Monday&amp;amp;#39;s briefing that while &amp;amp;quot;we are in a better place than we were last month,&amp;amp;quot; the administration expects &amp;amp;quot;headline inflation to be extraordinarily elevated due to Putin&amp;amp;#39;s price hike.&amp;amp;quot;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Psaki noted that the previous CPI report did not factor in jumps in energy prices brought about by the war in Ukraine but stressed that the United States is in &amp;amp;quot;a better place than we were last month.&amp;amp;quot;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;We expect a large difference between core and headline inflation, reflecting the global disruptions in energy and food markets,&amp;amp;quot; she continued. &amp;amp;quot;Of course, we know that core inflation, energy, the impact of energy, of course, on oil prices, gas prices — we expect that to continue to reflect what we&amp;amp;#39;ve seen the increases be over the course of this invasion.&amp;amp;quot;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Furthermore, Psaki used the opportunity to push Congress to pass the remainder of President Joe Biden&amp;amp;#39;s economic agenda and &amp;amp;quot;reduce costs for the American people.&amp;amp;quot;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;We have, of course, legislation that could do exactly that and cut the cost of childcare, of healthcare, of elder care,&amp;amp;quot; she stated. &amp;amp;quot;These all have enormous impacts on people&amp;amp;#39;s budgets, on when they&amp;amp;#39;re doing those calculations at their kitchen table, and certainly, this data will be a reminder of the need to do something and take additional steps.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now that we know for sure when it will hit $100k, it&amp;amp;#39;s time to take out a loan whilst being unemployed and FOMO it all into Bitcoin. Not only that, but let&amp;amp;#39;s talk to everyone we know and convince them to FOMO all their money in Bitcoin. What could go wrong, we have the word of experts. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Honestly though, I&amp;amp;#39;m already seeing articles about how Bitcoin will hit $100k by the end of 2022 and it feels like the same thing again that happened last year, namely, people expecting crazy gains because Bitcoin has moved up like 5%. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And this again will cause people invest in Bitcoin and expect to be rich by the end of the year, which is very unlikely, so they&amp;amp;#39;ll definitely be disappointed. I would say that we shouldn&amp;amp;#39;t really care how much Bitcoin will be this week, this month, or even this year. Why look at short term? Not like short term works with Bitcoin, because it&amp;amp;#39;s become a little stable compared to alts, and even they&amp;amp;#39;re not as volatile anymore to get you a lot of profits short term. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitcoin won&amp;amp;#39;t get you rich Short term, it&amp;amp;#39;s best to have patience and invest and wait. No, Waiting doesn&amp;amp;#39;t mean checking the charts every second of the day, simply DCA if you already do or forget about your investment. Patience does pay off.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;About the HBAR Foundation&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Founded in 2021, the HBAR Foundation fuels the development of the Hedera ecosystem by providing grants and other resources to developers, startups, and organizations that seek to launch decentralized applications in DeFi, NFTs, CBDCs, ESGs, gaming, and other sectors.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In addition to providing funding through a streamlined grant process, the HBAR Foundation acts as an integrated force multiplier through expert support across technical, marketing, business development, and other operational functions that are required to scale.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We have &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hbarfoundation.org/blog-post/the-hbar-foundation-2022-strategy&quot;&amp;gt;3 primary goals&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;: To grow awareness of, accelerate access to, and increase commerce within the HBAR economy. To that end, we measure our success via total value locked (TVL) as the aggregate value of the Hedera network.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Apply for funding for your project at &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hbarfoundation.org/apply&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.hbarfoundation.org/apply&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Primary Funds&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;About Hedera&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hedera.com/&quot;&amp;gt;Hedera&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; is a fast, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://hedera.com/blog/going-carbon-negative-at-hedera-hashgraph&quot;&amp;gt;carbon-negative&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, open-source, public network with Solidity-based smart contracts to power decentralized applications and a &amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://hedera.com/council&quot;&amp;gt;fully decentralized governing council&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; of global organizations spanning across web3 projects, enterprises, and universities.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The core contributors of Hedera are focused on building functionalities, services, and developer tooling to support the same types of applications being funded by the HBAR Foundation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One of the most exciting things about building on Hedera right now is that the DeFi ecosystem is just getting started with the re-introduction of &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://hedera.com/blog/unblocking-and-unloading-the-speed-secrets-behind-hedera-smart-contracts-2-0&quot;&amp;gt;optimized Smart Contracts&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; — there are 750k+ account holders looking to use $HBAR and builders of NFT and DeFi applications will be the first ones to give them this opportunity. We’ve already seen significant organic growth in NFT marketplaces, browser wallet support, and related projects.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Hedera Apps&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hedera is home to hundreds of projects in the web3 space — here’s a &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bmgentile/status/1404570788951326724&quot;&amp;gt;tweet thread&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; outlining a few of those larger applications. Additionally, full case studies can be found &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hedera.com/users&quot;&amp;gt;here&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As HBAR Foundation ecosystem grants ramp up, we’ll begin to see massive development of retail-focused applications coming to Hedera, such as these ones available today:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;NFT marketplaces like &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://zuse.market/&quot;&amp;gt;Zuse&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://hashaxis.com/&quot;&amp;gt;HashAxis&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, and &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://launch.turtlemoon.io/&quot;&amp;gt;Turtlemoon&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Wallets with transaction signing like &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hashpack.app/&quot;&amp;gt;HashPack&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.venly.io/&quot;&amp;gt;Venly&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Network bridges like &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hashport.network/&quot;&amp;gt;HashPort&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Staking delegation apps like &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://hedera.staderlabs.com/&quot;&amp;gt;StaderLabs&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All of which have been built organically by the Hedera developer community.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Smart Contract Hackathon | Now - May 16th | $500k+ in prizes&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hedera is hosting a &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://hedera22.devpost.com/&quot;&amp;gt;Solidity smart contract hackathon&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; through May 16th with over $500k in prizes to be earned for building DeFi, DAO, NFT, and Payment focused applications.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Upcoming Milestones&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The product and ecosystem roadmap for Hedera can be found at &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://hedera.com/roadmap&quot;&amp;gt;https://hedera.com/roadmap&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A few things we’re especially excited about:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Community-run network nodes&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Staking of HBAR on Hedera (&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-improvement-proposal/blob/master/HIP/hip-406.md&quot;&amp;gt;HIP-406&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Developer tooling (web3.js and ethers.js support)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Social&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;________________________________________________________________________________________________________________&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Myths to Dispel&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Myth #1: Hashgraph consensus and Hedera’s services are proprietary&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Hedera’s network services, officially supported SDKs, and every developer tool is open source under an Apache 2.0 license. Hashgraph consensus &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://cointelegraph.com/news/hedera-governing-council-to-buy-hashgraph-ip-and-open-source-projects-code&quot;&amp;gt;will be open source this year&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; under an Apache 2.0 license. You can find the Hedera project’s GitHub here: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hashgraph/&quot;&amp;gt;https://github.com/hashgraph/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Myth #2: Developers building dapps on Hedera can’t contribute to the project&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://hips.hedera.com/&quot;&amp;gt;Hedera Improvement Proposals (HIPs)&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; include core protocol changes, as well as changes to the applications, frameworks, and protocols built on top of the Hedera public network and used by the community.The &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://hips.hedera.com/&quot;&amp;gt;goal of HIPs&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; is to have a place for everyone to propose new features, collect community thoughts and input on a particular issue, document all subject matters in one place, and provide a status on their implementation. You can view all of the HIPs and contribute here: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://hips.hedera.com/all.html&quot;&amp;gt;https://hips.hedera.com/all.html&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Myth #3: Hedera is a private, permissioned network for Enterprises&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The Hedera network is a public network infrastructure for everyone to anonymously create accounts and build decentralized applications on, without telling anyone who they are or performing KYC/AML.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The Hedera network today is operated by members of the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://hedera.com/council&quot;&amp;gt;governing council&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; — each of the 26 members independently operates and maintains an individual node in their own data center or public cloud, ensuring full decentralization of consensus. This year, Hedera is allowing for community nodes — any member of the Hedera community can independently operate a node and earn &amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://hedera.com/hbar&quot;&amp;gt;$HBAR&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. And in the future, the entire network will be permissionless. Read the “path to permissionless” whitepaper &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://hedera.com/hh-decentralization-of-consensus.pdf&quot;&amp;gt;here&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Myth #4: Hedera doesn&amp;amp;#39;t have performant smart contracts&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Hedera’s smart contracts 2.0 is an implementation of the Besu EVM (Solidity) that has been optimized for the Hedera network and hashgraph consensus. Solidity-based smart contracts on Hedera off the following benefits:

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;No congestion fees for gas  / all txn fees are fixed (&amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hedera.com/fees&quot;&amp;gt;www.hedera.com/fees&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;15 million gas / second&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;300+ txns / second&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Integration with the native Token Service on Hedera mapped to ERC-20, 721, 1155 standards, 10k txns per second, and $0.0001 txn fees.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Getting started with Hedera: A guide for devs and degens&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Developer Quickstart&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The easiest way as a developer to get started building on Hedera is by checking out the official Hedera documentation at &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.hedera.com/&quot;&amp;gt;https://docs.hedera.com/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and getting a testnet account from &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://portal.hedera.com/&quot;&amp;gt;https://portal.hedera.com&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; — we have &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.hedera.com/guides/docs/sdks&quot;&amp;gt;officially-supported SDKs&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; available in Java, Javascript, and Go.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.hedera.com/guides/getting-started/environment-set-up&quot;&amp;gt;Set up your environment&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Try &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.hedera.com/guides/getting-started/try-examples&quot;&amp;gt;examples&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.hedera.com/guides/resources/tutorials&quot;&amp;gt;tutorials&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, and &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.hedera.com/guides/resources/demo-applications&quot;&amp;gt;demo applications&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Degen Quickstart&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As a self-proclaimed degenerate holding $HBAR, you have opportunities to use that $HBAR for things like staking, minting, buying, and selling NFTs, and participating in DeFi applications.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Install the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hashpack.app/post/how-to-create-your-first-account-with-hashpack&quot;&amp;gt;HashPack&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; browser wallet extension on Chrome: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hashpack.app/post/how-to-create-your-first-account-with-hashpack&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.hashpack.app/post/how-to-create-your-first-account-with-hashpack&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Check out the various applications on Hedera of which you can connect to via HashPack: NFT marketplaces (over 400+ NFT projects and over $4M USD in aggregate transactions) like &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://zuse.market/&quot;&amp;gt;Zuse&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://hashaxis.com/&quot;&amp;gt;HashAxis&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, and &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://launch.turtlemoon.io/&quot;&amp;gt;Turtlemoon&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, network bridges to and from Ethereum and Polygon via &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hashport.network/&quot;&amp;gt;HashPort&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, and staking delegation apps like &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://hedera.staderlabs.com/&quot;&amp;gt;StaderLabs&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Edit on the title:  The funding allocated to the HBAR Foundation consisted of 5 billion hbars (approximately 10% of total supply), currently worth US $1 billion as of September 16th, 2021.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As you can see by the technical analysis and illustration above of Bitcoin&amp;amp;#39;s history, it is going down to 0. Considering the trend analysis above, you should all sell your Bitcoin before it hits 0. Do NOT zoom out, only look at 1D or 7D charts when reviewing Bitcoins history, otherwise you may say silly things like &amp;amp;quot;its literally just flat month over month lul&amp;amp;quot; or &amp;amp;quot;historically this same move has happened hundreds of times&amp;amp;quot; or &amp;amp;quot;bruh this isn&amp;amp;#39;t even a dip lol&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/zrdjdy7ebzs81.png?width=974&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e59137e1e62b6a87e6d54f8201979ca88bccb30c&quot;&amp;gt;1M&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/w9uuxt40czs81.png?width=862&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=9bea928d547e2675dded2e5b8f560b8f4bc9e1cd&quot;&amp;gt;All&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;IGNORE ALL THAT - Just focus on what makes you feel scared and worried about your decisions. See all that red below? RED BAD. Its gone down THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN ONE DAY. By my math, it will be zero in just a few more days.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/6mif38xwbzs81.png?width=878&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=7921012d62b723d809b9c59fccc400b34dc2ee3b&quot;&amp;gt;1D&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now that I have educated you - Please sell your bitcoin. Act on that fear and worry, and I will even do you a favor. To allow all of you to exit at the best possible price, my friends and I will be market buying Bitcoin for the rest of the day to help you all exit your positions. You are all whalecome. And remember, do NOT zoom out, do NOT review historical data past 1 week, and FEEL AND SPREAD PANIC.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My first experience with Crypto was when someone from a different country sent me $100 fund to support for a business i proposed. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;LESN 1. Crypto closes the location gap for funding useful projects.
&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Few months after my first exposure, Bitcoin dropped from 10k to 4k. It took some time, but it came back up, now around 40k+&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;LESN 2. The market is very volatile, have faith or go home safely.
&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Later on, I decided to invest in Alt coins, i asked a knowledgeable friend for suggestions, and he suggested &amp;amp;quot;Coin X&amp;amp;quot; (name undisclosed).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I invested in Coin X a little and it showed signs of growth in the first few weeks. Not so long Coin X dipped, came back up then dipped again. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;LESN 3. Spare money is your safety net.
&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A few times, i tried swapping my initial investment between markets to Chase my losses. Ultimately lost on them too.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;LESN 4. You can&amp;amp;#39;t time the market, switching in between investments/markets can dip you into more losses than your initial.

LESN 5. It&amp;amp;#39;s just money, don&amp;amp;#39;t get attached to coins, it&amp;amp;#39;s not your religion and its not saving the world. if you lose your money there wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t be pity for you by the creators.
&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So i started receiving crypto payment for my freelance while looking for a day job. I hedl as an alternative to cashing out. The crash came and my assets are worth about 30% of the actual amount i got paid. Reminded me of LESN 3 and&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;LESN 6. DYOR doesn&amp;amp;#39;t mean you will not lose your money.
&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Finally.  Work in real life with your value skills, budget some of your savings for crypto. That way, losses hit you less and you&amp;amp;#39;d have the strength to continue (if you have to). That&amp;amp;#39;s one of the ways to the Financial Independence you want from crypto&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There have been a lot of posts like this one about shorts being liquidated and people in the comments celebrating that shorts got &amp;amp;quot;rekt&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We have to show the other side as well and remind people that the opposite is also true, as $420.69 million was liquidated in just 24 hours.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;$300 million was wiped just from BTC, ETH, LUNA, SOL, DOGE and NEAR.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Remember, don&amp;amp;#39;t over leverage yourself on short or long, because you can get fucked both ways.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: While I was making this post the liquidations rose by $20 million, so it&amp;amp;#39;s at $440 million right now, but I left the old title for obvious reasons.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What an utter fucking disappointment. The more I spend time in this space, the more stupid I fucking feel. I am going to wait a full year before most probably liquidating everything and just get pleasure from being able to call the rest of y’all idiots over at &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/buttcoin&quot;&amp;gt;r/buttcoin&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I so wish I was wrong, but it more and more feels like the early glory days are over and I am caught up in an elaborate scam. I can’t tell anyone to invest in crypto with a straight face. What a terrible investment, could have made more $ with a shitty savings account, and the time I wasted (and continue to waste), that’s the true tragedy.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;cue the sycophants…&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
