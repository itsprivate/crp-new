Remember that he was invited by the CIA for this conference. That means CIA I knew about Bitcoin.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is what he posted&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I want to get this out in the open because it is the kind of thing that will generate conspiracy theories: I&amp;amp;#39;m going to give a presentation about Bitcoin at CIA Headquarters in June at an emerging technologies conference for the US intelligence community.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I accepted the invitation to speak because the act that I was invited means Bitcoin is already on their radar, and I think it might be a good chance to talk about why I think Bitcoin will make the world a better place. I think the goals of this project are to create better currency, create a more competitive and efficient international payment incompatible with goals of government.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m only very slightly worried that talking about Bitcoin at the CIA will increase the chances that they&amp;amp;#39;ll try to do something we don&amp;amp;#39;t want them to do. I think accepting their invitation and being open about exactly what bitcoin is will make it less likely they will see it as a threat.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;PS: Full Disclosure: I&amp;amp;#39;ll be paid a one-time fee of $3K to cover expenses and pay me for my time. I don&amp;amp;#39;t want any &amp;amp;quot;Gavin is on the CIA&amp;amp;#39;s payroll&amp;amp;quot; rumors to get started, either  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;as always, comments and questions and discussion welcome. I&amp;amp;#39;d really rather not hear any conspiracy theories about how they will secretly implant a mind-control chip in my head while I&amp;amp;#39;m there, though.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Once you get a decent amount in your bags, and it becomes more than what you want to leave on an exchange, you may have to start dealing with managing your own wallet and your backup seed phrase, which you have to store securely.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That&amp;amp;#39;s those 12-24 random words that serves as a way to recover your wallet.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;The don&amp;amp;#39;ts:&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;1- Settling for just paper.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We have a lot of papers, mail, cards, etc, passing through our daily lives. Another piece of paper can get lost in the mix. It&amp;amp;#39;s crazy how pieces of papers we think we&amp;amp;#39;ve stored securely, sometimes just vanish.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Worse....paper is not durable. If your house is flooded, burns down, that paper could get easily destroyed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you have thousands of dollars, do you want it to be backed up on something that can easily burn away?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/ifaefshzc3w81.jpg?width=600&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=5574f661de71ca9b3de3cb4e8df2633ce50f1058&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/ifaefshzc3w81.jpg?width=600&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=5574f661de71ca9b3de3cb4e8df2633ce50f1058&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;2- Printing your seed.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Most people know better not to store their seed online, on their computer, phone, or any device with an online connection. But many don&amp;amp;#39;t realize that printers have a network connection to their computer.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Printers are a weak point of entry for an attack. It&amp;amp;#39;s typically one of the weakest point in a network.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On top of that, everything you print gets temporarily stored on your printer, long after you&amp;amp;#39;ve finished and turned off your printer.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The last thing you want stored on your printer is your seed phrase.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;3- Putting your seed in a portable safe.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Safe make it obvious where you store your most valuable stuff. But that&amp;amp;#39;s OK, as long as no one can break in, or worse just pick it up. There&amp;amp;#39;s nothing worse than a safe that someone can just lift and carry, even if it may take two people.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The only case where you would do this. Is if where you live, there is very little risk of burglary, and greater risk of fire, but the funds are too small to be worth investing into a proper safe.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/3fk5x637d3w81.jpg?width=306&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=165a674f026de429fea9562ac1d7ceded074c247&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/3fk5x637d3w81.jpg?width=306&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=165a674f026de429fea9562ac1d7ceded074c247&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;4- Creating too much mental gymnastics.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s not just the flimsy security that can turn against you, too much security can be your biggest enemy.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You still need to be able to access it, and figure it out easily. That means a year from now, you still need to be able to figure out how to find it, access it, decode it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You don&amp;amp;#39;t want to have so much security that it locks you out, and you can&amp;amp;#39;t recover your key.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Only have the level of security you need, and accessible enough for you.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You aren&amp;amp;#39;t guarding the nuclear codes. So you don&amp;amp;#39;t need to give yourself insane mental gymnastics to access your funds.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;5- Sharing your seed phrase.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A seed phrase is not something you&amp;amp;#39;ll ever need to share with anyone.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A seed phrase is not something people need to send you funds, or send you a prize, or reward.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Much less is Ledger, Trezor, or any company you&amp;amp;#39;ve dealt with for crypto ever need your seed phrase.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Same when you store it. You don&amp;amp;#39;t want to share it with the entire internet. So don&amp;amp;#39;t leave it in the cloud. Even if it&amp;amp;#39;s password protected, you are still leaving on someone else&amp;amp;#39;s server. There&amp;amp;#39;s no way to ever be sure if those servers have a backdoor vulnerability.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;5 good tricks:&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;1- Engraving your seed.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There&amp;amp;#39;s 3 ways to store your seed in a fire/flood proof way. Engrave it with a stamp, engrave it with a pen, or use pre-made letters.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;From my experience, pre-made letters is the worst. It&amp;amp;#39;s still costly, and if the trap door gets loose, you lose your seed. And the letters don&amp;amp;#39;t seem to be impressed too well.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/omnvkpjwe3w81.jpg?width=1200&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=375b8af9c26badb465c26c4715a878ecacfb7e04&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/omnvkpjwe3w81.jpg?width=1200&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=375b8af9c26badb465c26c4715a878ecacfb7e04&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Stamps are fine, but it&amp;amp;#39;s more time consuming, I sometimes don&amp;amp;#39;t get a good impression, and it&amp;amp;#39;s not even much cheaper.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/ngtx76sxe3w81.jpg?width=1280&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=5658c6b34ddd5734f33fc6e272e2858cc1d92e01&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/ngtx76sxe3w81.jpg?width=1280&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=5658c6b34ddd5734f33fc6e272e2858cc1d92e01&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Engraving pens are actually not expensive. You can get good ones on Amazon for $30. And you can engrave it on anything. You can control better how deep the impression will be.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/vii08iqye3w81.jpg?width=600&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=b728c3ead5928f511676140156cb08afce7daf3a&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/vii08iqye3w81.jpg?width=600&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=b728c3ead5928f511676140156cb08afce7daf3a&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;2- A proper safe.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Obviously, this is a bigger investment, so it&amp;amp;#39;s only gonna be worth it if there&amp;amp;#39;s big funds to safeguard behind those private keys.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;No need to buy a $1,500 safe to protect $1,000 worth of crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While a safe will let a burglar know where all your valuable stuff is, knowing won&amp;amp;#39;t help much if they can&amp;amp;#39;t break in.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Or at least, take too long. Every safe can be broken into. Some just take muuuch longer.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Make sure you have a safe that&amp;amp;#39;s hard to break into. Don&amp;amp;#39;t get a cheap SentrySafe. Get a good brand. Locks using keys are the easiest to break into. Get one with a keypad.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As I said before, don&amp;amp;#39;t get one that a burglar can just carry off. Nor a wall safe that&amp;amp;#39;s easy to pull off from your drywall.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;More importantly, get a safe with a strong fire delay rating.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;3- Getting creative with your storage.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you can&amp;amp;#39;t afford a proper safe, or don&amp;amp;#39;t have enough funds to make it worthwhile, or are renting a place and can&amp;amp;#39;t bolt anything to the ground, then you can always get creative at storing hiding your seed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hiding a seed phrase in accessible places, requires the help of tip #5 on my list: encryption.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A good rule of thumb, a good hiding place usually involves having to unscrew something.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But you don&amp;amp;#39;t necessarily have to hide your plate. You can also engrave parts of your seed on things.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That could be any metal part in your house, or anything with any chance of resisting a fire.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/2fi89rwfy3w81.jpg?width=1600&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=4d402296017db2ef0a9676e2953127115ad1edc8&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/2fi89rwfy3w81.jpg?width=1600&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=4d402296017db2ef0a9676e2953127115ad1edc8&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But not all metals have the same degree of fire resistance.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You&amp;amp;#39;ll likely lose a lot of fire resistance doing this.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you are worried about fires, you&amp;amp;#39;ll sill want to stick with a more fire resistant plate.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/nqz9kdx3h3w81.jpg?width=1200&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=aa7c5b99f926d677e4ee69031d033dde0510ddc2&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/nqz9kdx3h3w81.jpg?width=1200&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=aa7c5b99f926d677e4ee69031d033dde0510ddc2&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;4- Consider using multiple locations.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can have parts of the seed phrase in multiple places in your house, or at entirely different locations. But if you do that, losing one portion means you lose it all, so be careful.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can also use multiple locations if you want multiple backups. You could give an encrypted version with a family member to put in their safe.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;5- Encrypt or cypher your seed.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You don&amp;amp;#39;t necessarily have to write your 24 words in order from 1 to 24, nor even write the actual words.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is getting into a little bit of mental gymnastics, so be careful. But if you can keep it simple and have a method of recovering the process, it&amp;amp;#39;s fine. Don&amp;amp;#39;t rely on your memory to decode it a year later.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Basically, it&amp;amp;#39;s scrambling or coding your seed. So even if someone finds your seed phrase, it will be jumbled.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With encryption, you don&amp;amp;#39;t even need to split your seed phrase into multiple locations in your house. You can keep it all on one plate, with probably still a lot more security.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Just be careful where you store the decoder, or the method of decoding.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If all it takes is for someone to have the decoder to get your seed, then your seed is only as secure as your decoder.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There&amp;amp;#39;s a ton of methods around this. Look into different cyphers, different types of encryptions. Find one that suits you.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Encrypting your seed opens up the door to how you can more easily and safely store your seed phrase.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Most of the retailers in the market have been leaving crypto, for now. Last approximate 1.5 years a lot of hype was present and a lot of retailers joined the party for quick gains. Now that the market topped at the last all time high, and we have been in an accumulation range for a long period, most people looking for gold have given up. Or they have been liquidated.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Throughout the, brief, history of bitcoin (and cryptocurrency in general) there have been multiple periods like the one we are in now. Historically, these periods were followed by new jumps of the market to new highs.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you are reading this, you haven&amp;amp;#39;t given up. Or at least you shouldn&amp;amp;#39;t. Be careful now with any trades you make. There are roughly three things you could do. Hodl and wait. Sell most, if not all, wait for a definitive bottom and buy in after confirmation. Or wait to buy in when upper resistance levels have cleared and the markets are in a bull run again.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All of the above, I believe, will yield you good gains in coming 6-18 months. Not something I can guarantee obviously. But look at adoption, growth, technology emerging in the crypto industry. There is no doubt for me it will be used more than ever in the future.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Stay calm. Be patient. Being here puts you in a favorable position in comparison with most.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I don&amp;amp;#39;t understand why people invest so much that it stresses them out when everyone here is constantly screaming warnings of how volatile this market is.. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Today he/she/they released their last message to the public, that already forshadowed the disappearance, the message was about not caring much about him but Bitcoin as a whole and the Dev team that was and is basically working for free on Bitcoin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now after 11 years many see this as a major mystery and maybe say that he even died. But for me it&amp;amp;#39;s seems clear that he knowingly made this decision of going out forever.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;During that time he disappeared, Bitcoin was picking up pace for the first time. Already the first big investments came in and it actually was seen as serious by some people. His work was done. He brought Bitcoin to the light and it was not his task to bring it further.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Because of his disappearance, today no one is capable of criticising him as he basically does not exist. He left making Bitcoin truely neutral, there is no  &amp;amp;quot;head&amp;amp;quot; or maker that has any specific goals for this projects, it&amp;amp;#39;s truely just us.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The man who loves to creat hype around his beloved Doge and just when everyone is jumping the bandwagon, drop the hammer on the same coin. Like in the middle of SNL? Yes. That Elon. Same man who promised you can buy Tesla with Doge but always had some kind of excuse for not doing it?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The richest man in the world which I am sure was possible because he is such a nice and caring human being and not a greedy wage thief! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It isn&amp;amp;#39;t good, but it is the best search tool I can find since reddit doesn&amp;amp;#39;t let me short through oldest first.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The oldest post I can find is something in &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;2013&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; asking for good alt coins, but it got the same reply as what someone today would be asking that. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;2014&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; there was a ton of post on giveaway, a few asking for help in making a crypto coin (one I found looked like a rug pull or just a coin that got some hyped and died), some post about mining, some post about how there will be how and why alt coins will overtake BTC.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What I found interesting with that last bit is they were talking about the transaction speeds of BTC and things like that. The focus was still on using it as a currency.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The one I found interesting is &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/2a1y8f/the_death_of_dogecoin/&quot;&amp;gt;https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/2a1y8f/the_death_of_dogecoin/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/auk515f8kwv81.png?width=1100&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=5bf6c8dc9938a610fd61fd22740a5d43ab232507&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/auk515f8kwv81.png?width=1100&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=5bf6c8dc9938a610fd61fd22740a5d43ab232507&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Basically, people 8 years ago was facing the same problems as we are today in the SEC is highly unclear and how people weren&amp;amp;#39;t sure what to invest in because the USA dragged it&amp;amp;#39;s feet when dealing with crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;2015&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; it seems like most were asking if a coin is dead, they were talking about how hard it is to invest thanks due to banks, and other things&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For that year I found this to be interesting &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/3gtg5g/whats_the_most_interesting_altcoin_youve_ever/&quot;&amp;gt;https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/3gtg5g/whats_the_most_interesting_altcoin_youve_ever/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They asked what is the most interesting alt coin. Most of them I never heard of and they died a long time ago. But this is an interesting comment.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/tny0c7gclwv81.png?width=1081&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=55e6682cc4d93c851e138057a4d406115510106c&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/tny0c7gclwv81.png?width=1081&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=55e6682cc4d93c851e138057a4d406115510106c&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/7hma0mqelwv81.png?width=1146&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=f144f2959647cadfb1662ca8943a9724c74ee343&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/7hma0mqelwv81.png?width=1146&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=f144f2959647cadfb1662ca8943a9724c74ee343&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Something to note is we get some FUD 2014 and 2015 against Doge. Even comments saying &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/hoi1k9x4mwv81.png?width=1064&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=ce713a9b19ccb102b60fc2653886843ddb158280&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/hoi1k9x4mwv81.png?width=1064&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=ce713a9b19ccb102b60fc2653886843ddb158280&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Even ETH is looked as a scam. But note this is people like today trying to figure out the good from bad in the tech.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/zgy2frjimwv81.png?width=1117&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e23b91ea40d4771111797713d7c1f7714b492fc1&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/zgy2frjimwv81.png?width=1117&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e23b91ea40d4771111797713d7c1f7714b492fc1&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;2016&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; has more people looking for alt coins, best coins to mine, how to get into mining, exchanges, and stuff like that.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Basically, this is the year when people started wanting to do something with their coins or do something like mining to get coins. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Looking at some recommendation coins shows what we see now where people don&amp;amp;#39;t know what they are talking about&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/qz7gtmjinwv81.png?width=1153&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=31aa8705adbb4ec24d9665424b9de8b605841233&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/qz7gtmjinwv81.png?width=1153&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=31aa8705adbb4ec24d9665424b9de8b605841233&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/346z4xhlnwv81.png?width=1137&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=1b2e36d78f86fd4eea0d22fb08be688d38308c4a&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/346z4xhlnwv81.png?width=1137&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=1b2e36d78f86fd4eea0d22fb08be688d38308c4a&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In that same post people were seriously recommending things like Truck Coin. There was some that gave good advice, like what you see today &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/s1q56satnwv81.png?width=1072&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=d9735a59f350b564a7324bdbeb3b7ad206c4f593&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/s1q56satnwv81.png?width=1072&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=d9735a59f350b564a7324bdbeb3b7ad206c4f593&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There is almost no word about Doge but there is a number of post about ETH. It looks like ETH is taken serious at this point. Same with Litecoin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;2017&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; there was post about what coin will 10x in 2018, more ETH post, Doge, memes started to come up, people freaking out about dips, and so on.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/ldo8vrnqowv81.png?width=640&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=b0b9f8d50b6bce66d72002e3e548fea4162c5ffa&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/ldo8vrnqowv81.png?width=640&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=b0b9f8d50b6bce66d72002e3e548fea4162c5ffa&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I found that cute. that is like a 10am for me. I wonder what they would be like with the losses we have now.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There is Coinbase fud because Coinbase added a coin they didn&amp;amp;#39;t like. And again people were talking about how the SEC isn&amp;amp;#39;t being clear with their regulations.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Most of the post were like a 2021 where the price went everywhere.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;2018&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Robinhood launches it&amp;amp;#39;s crypto trading app, Bitconnect, and virtually nothing else showed up on the search. IDK I guess it was a dead year. The daily went from 14k to 2k comments.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;2019&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; this looks like another dead year since the daily was getting 3k comments, there was some fud on how BTC uses more electricity than most small countries (while overlooking BTC is worldwide and comparing it is stupid). There was some push for NANO. Some post about ETH, the Binance block against USA people, and that is about it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;2020&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; another dead year. The daily was getting 1k comments some months. There was XRP FUD, hacks, the XRP SEC thing, and that is about it. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;2021&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; the daily kicks back up with some days getting 35k comments. Anyone who was there would tell you it was price, meme, lambo, questions for those coming in, and so on.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The Final Message&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Satoshi sent this message to early Bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen as a response to Andresen talking about Satoshi in the press&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;“I wish you would stop talking about me as a mysterious shadowy figure. The press just turns that into a pirate currency angle. Maybe instead make it about the open source project and give more credit to contributors. It helps motivate them.”&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Satoshi did not want to be the leader or founder figure of Bitcoin. He wanted it to be a pure open source project created by and for all of humanity. It was clear from the beginning in every decision he made and his actions make more and more sense after he left.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Even 6 months before this final message, there were already signs that Satoshi would leave. In December 2010, he removed his name from Bitcoin&amp;amp;#39;s SourceForge license document and updated all email contacts on Bitcoin.org to other developers. Satoshi&amp;amp;#39;s last public message on Bitcointalk was on December 12, 2010. Through Gavin, he asked all the volunteer developers to take the project forward.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This was Gavin&amp;amp;#39;s message on behalf of Satoshi shared to Bitcointalk forum on January 13, 2011.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“So who is willing and able to help out? Don&amp;amp;#39;t ask permission, just jump in, grab a bug that catches your interest, add comments to it as you start to figure out what the problem is (or isn&amp;amp;#39;t), and submit a PULL request when you have a fix.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Your reward will be recognition, admiration and respect. It is time to take bitcoin from, essentially, a single-programmer project to a robust open source project with lots of contributors.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;By studying the early history of Bitcoin it&amp;amp;#39;s clear that Satoshi only planned to stay as long as he was needed to get Bitcoin up and running. Once others started chipping in, he knew his work was done and he left.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Today there are hundreds of Bitcoin developers but you may not know that they don&amp;amp;#39;t get any salary to work on Bitcoin. They are supported only by sponsors and donations. If you hold good amount of BTC, maybe you should consider donating at least 1% to Bitcoin FOSS developers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Somewhere in America, a lump of coal is burned every time a book is ordered on-line.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/forbes/1999/0531/6311070a.html?sh=12b1b1ad2580&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.forbes.com/forbes/1999/0531/6311070a.html?sh=12b1b1ad2580&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The current fuel-economy rating: about 1 pound of coal to create, package, store and move 2 megabytes of data. The digital age, it turns out, is very energy-intensive. The Internet may someday save us bricks, mortar and catalog paper, but it is burning up an awful lot of fossil fuel in the process.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
There are already over 17,000 pure dot-com companies (Ebay, E-Trade, etc.).&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
The larger ones each represent the electric load of a small village.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Media tried to gaslight and brainwash tech companies with the burning fossil fuel narrative.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some 20 years onwards, this entire article reads like a joke.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Getting the bits from dot-com to desktop requires still more electricity. Cisco&amp;amp;#39;s 7500 series router, for example, keeps the Web hot by routing an impressive 400 million bits per second, but to do that it needs 1.5 kilowatts of power. The wireless Web draws even more power, because its signals are broadcast in all directions, rather than being tunneled down a wire or fiber&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
Just fabricating all these digital boxes requires a tremendous amount of electricity. The billion-dollar fabrication plants are packed with furnaces, pumps, dryers and ion beams, all electrically driven. It takes 9 kilowatt-hours to etch circuits onto a square inch of silicon, and about as much power to manufacture an entire PC (1,000 kilowatt-hours)as it takes to run it for a year. And there are at least 300 of these factories in the U.S. Collectively, fabs and their suppliers currently consume nearly 1% of the nation&amp;amp;#39;s electric output.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
The global implications are enormous. Intel projects a billion people on-line worldwide. That&amp;amp;#39;s $1 trillion in computer sales -- and another $1 trillion investment in a hard-power backbone to supply electricity. One billion PCs on the Web represent an electric demand equal to the total capacity of the U.S. today.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Does this resemble the current attacks against cryptocurrencies?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The exact same arguments are now used against bitcoin, trying to fool people into believing that bitcoin is the worst thing in the world.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thousands of people believe what these articles at face value despite not having any understanding of the intricacies of bitcoin mining&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

For those who are out of the loop, a moonshot is something that has a low probability of becoming extremely successful [1].&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While it’s definitely nice to be the guy who made the correct play, what I wanted to understand is, how likely are you to pick the next big coin? After all, there are more than &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coinopsy.com/dead-coins/#other&quot;&amp;gt;2,400 dead coins&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; that were part of someone’s moonshot not that long back. When a coin is dead, we would end up losing almost 100% of the capital that we invested in it thereby breaking the cardinal rule of investing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Rule No. 1: Never lose money. Rule No. 2: Never forget rule No. 1 -&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Warren Buffet&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While Warren Buffet might not be the best example for the crypto world, his advice holds true just as well in all investing spaces - Once you lose your capital, it’s game over. So in this deep-dive, let&amp;amp;#39;s see how the less popular cryptos have performed over the years, whether it makes sense to invest in them, and finally, would you have made better returns just by investing in the top cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum?!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Data &amp;amp;amp; Analysis Methodology&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All the data used in the analysis has been collected from coinmarketcap.com. Their data is available going as far back as 2014. I collected the price, market cap, and the symbol for all the coins listed in coinmarketcap on Jan 1st of every year from 2014 to 2022. There were only 67 listed coins in 2014. The list has grown to more than 3,000+ as of Jan 2022. All the data and my analysis are shared as a Rows sheet at the end.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The analysis is fairly simple and I have intentionally made the strategy straightforward so that it’s easy to replicate. We will be comparing the performance of the Top 10 Cryptocurrencies with the next 90 based on the total market cap of the coin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/ie9owd9mylv81.png?width=895&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=4830cb8e014e559cb2754b8f514a90a7f1787ac1&quot;&amp;gt;The end of 2017 was definitely some wild time to be in the Crypto space.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I have limited the analysis to the top 100 coins because of two reasons&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Even now, close to 95% of the combined market cap of the crypto market is contributed by just the top 100 coins. Adding to this, it becomes more and more difficult/riskier [2] to invest in coins having low market cap due to platform and liquidity issues.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;There are hundreds of new coins that are being launched every day. It’s almost impossible to keep track of all the coins and realistically do proper due diligence before investing. So for practical feasibility, I am limiting it to the top 100.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Results&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Before we jump straight into the return calculation, it’s interesting to see how the crypto market has changed over the years.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/m0fng8moylv81.png?width=649&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=98fb3edb350696ab03e9136c7b2eaf3ab9f46336&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/m0fng8moylv81.png?width=649&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=98fb3edb350696ab03e9136c7b2eaf3ab9f46336&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the first few years where crypto was becoming mainstream (2014 to 2017), the top 10 currencies dominated the overall market cap contributing close to 99% [3]. Also, during crashes, we can observe a massive shift in capital allocation from Altcoin to Bitcoin → 2017 was one of the best bull runs (barring 2021) where we can see that Bitcoin only contributed to ~39% of the market cap. But once the bear market set in (2018-19), the allocation to bitcoin proportionally increased until the 2021 bull run.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;Creating a Crypto Index&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To answer our initial question → Whether it’s better to invest in the top 10 most popular cryptos or the other 90 relatively lesser-known ones, we will be creating an equal-weighted index [4].&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We have two people Alan and Charlie who want to get into the crypto market in 2014, but both are following a slightly different approach.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Alan will invest only in the top 10 most popular currencies. Every new year, he will go and check the top 10 cryptos by Market Cap and then equally invest between the top 10 cryptocurrencies. Charlie, on the other hand, will do the exact same thing with the only difference being that instead of the top 10, he will invest in the 90 next biggest cryptocurrencies.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They continue to do this over the next 8 years and now it’s 2022 and it’s time to see who has performed better.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/5u10wctsylv81.png?width=628&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=aacb02399d50dbd1d1874aba631a97dc354dbaab&quot;&amp;gt;Returns shown here are till Jan 1st, 2022&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Would you look at that! Alan who has invested in only the top-10 cryptos did vastly better than Charlie who went for the riskier play of investing in the not so well known currencies. The top 10 cryptos on average performed 5x better than the next 90 and 2x better than just investing in Bitcoin. What’s even more interesting is that Charlie would have done 2x better just putting his money in Bitcoin - Ouch!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;Survival&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you are wondering why Charlie is getting the lowest return in spite of taking the most risk[5], it’s because you are forgetting Rule 1 of investing - To not lose your initial investment.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/mmntwr9vylv81.png?width=714&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=6c69754b5cbf65bc865d87a11ea5116baf9f5a70&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/mmntwr9vylv81.png?width=714&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=6c69754b5cbf65bc865d87a11ea5116baf9f5a70&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The probability of survival of a coin is extremely skewed towards the top 10 currencies. As you can see, over 80% of the top 10 coins from 2014 are still in existence today compared to only 26% of the rest. This trend keeps repeating over the years and your capital would have been decimated. Once it goes to zero, there is no way for it to come back up as any gain on $0 is still 0!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;Moonshots&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Finally, we come to what we are all here for! What are our chances of actually hitting a moonshot following this strategy?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/j8oiifewylv81.png?width=404&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=fec161da3968b773bb1f96eca3da9c114da48cd9&quot;&amp;gt;I have defined a 100x return as a Moonshot&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Well, your chances of hitting a moonshot are also much higher following the top-10 strategy. Overall, you had a 1 in 10 chance of getting a 10,000% return compared to the 1 in 30 chance of the riskier next-90 strategy.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The above chart also shows another interesting stat → Out of the 500+ cryptos that we analyzed, less than 4% of them ended up becoming a moonshot. Think about that for a min - Of all the cryptos you are likely to hear about (&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;as there is very less coverage if it’s not in the top 100&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;), only 3-4% of them end up giving you those insane returns. You have similar chances betting on a single number on the Roulette wheel.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/23hva9qyylv81.png?width=391&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=9bf4c72e5515d1c77faa01aa82b29eaf590c6289&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/23hva9qyylv81.png?width=391&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=9bf4c72e5515d1c77faa01aa82b29eaf590c6289&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As you can see, of all our moonshots, Ethereum investment in 2016 ended up returning the most at a whopping 397,548%!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Limitations&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It’s important to understand the limitations of the current analysis before trying to replicate it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Data&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; - As I discussed earlier, all the data is from coinmarketcap and I have assumed a coin is dead if it’s not listed in the following year’s data. This analysis is only as strong as the quality of input data [6]. I have done extensive QCs but feel free to play around with the raw data to see if I missed something.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Base Effect&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; - The market is considerably different now than it was in 2015-17. There is more awareness as well as penetration. So the future growth might not be as explosive as the one that we observed in the past decade, so you should be realistic about your return potential&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Intra Year Returns&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; - The current analysis only considers returns based on Jan 1st of every year starting from 2014. If we pick another date within the year, we might get slightly different results as there might have been ATHs and ATLs within the year which we are not capturing.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Conclusion&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s not whether you&amp;amp;#39;re right or wrong that&amp;amp;#39;s important, but how much money you make when you&amp;amp;#39;re right and how much you lose when you&amp;amp;#39;re wrong — George Soros&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I started the analysis thinking that investing in the not-so-popular currencies is bound to give better returns as it’s more likely they are undervalued due to lower publicity and hype associated with them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But, as we saw from the data, in the case of crypto it’s much more profitable just to invest in the top currencies. It’s like the case where being in the game is much more important than trying to hit it big and striking out!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;If you liked this post, you might like my other analysis on Crytpo:&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://marketsentiment.substack.com/p/crypto-dca?s=w&quot;&amp;gt;How to consistently make returns from the Crypto market by using Dollar Cost Averaging&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Data:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; All the data used in the analysis &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://rows.com/market-sentiment/my-spreadsheets/untitled-spreadsheet-3-7fuGkqeJVN8gkvISEezt43/live&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;can be found here&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;(it’s a treasure-trove of information IMO as you can filter based on the rank, price, market cap - however you like it. All I ask is that if you can find a better strategy based on this data, do let us all know!)&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Footnotes&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;[1] The &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/moonshot&quot;&amp;gt;word&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; itself is derived from the Apollo 11 spaceflight project and is often used to classify something that seems almost impossible.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;[2] Extremely small coins are more likely to face liquidity issues, consolidated ownerships, and rug pulls.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;[3] For comparison, the top 10 companies in S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 only contribute &amp;amp;lt;30% of the index and that itself is considered to be extremely skewed by some analysts.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;[4] An equal-weighted index is where we invest equally regardless of the market cap of the crypto. All the famous indices like S&amp;amp;amp;P500 are market cap-weighted - i.e, bigger companies get a bigger chunk of your investment&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;[5] I mean the 2,000% return is no joke → S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 barely gave a 100% return over the same period. It’s all relative, eh!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I am not talking about any &amp;amp;quot;FUD&amp;amp;quot; by the mainstream media - for every article making unfair attacks against crypto there is another one depicting it overly positive, and I feel most fall between these extremes and are mostly somewhat fair.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I am talking about how the community reacts to positive news. Take, for example, the Central African Republic introducing Bitcoin as legal tender a few days ago. Quite a few crypto media reported on it and there were three posts about it made yesterday, all three got to &amp;amp;quot;hot&amp;amp;quot;, getting about 1,000 upvotes together. Don&amp;amp;#39;t get me wrong, it&amp;amp;#39;s huge news, so I understand, the only problem I have with it: &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;it&amp;amp;#39;s not true, they did no such thing&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When I made a post explaining that this was just, well, wrong, a few hours ago, nobody saw it. It is currently at about 10 upvotes, one hundreth of the other posts. So nobody questioned the fake news - because it was positive - and a post debunking it isn&amp;amp;#39;t seen by anyone. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is by no means a single incident - let&amp;amp;#39;s just stick with crypto as legal tender, do you remember when Bitcoin would be introduced as legal tender in Honduras? When Bitcoin Cash was going to be introduced as legal tender in St. Maarten? When Shiba Inu was going to become legal tender in Turkey? That all happened in the past, like, two months, and of course all of them were fake news without any basis. But they made huge waves in crypto communities, many many people read about them and believed them - and I have literally never seen a crypto medium make a corrigendum about fake news they published, and I&amp;amp;#39;ve rarely seen any crypto figures admit that they have shared something that turned out to be wrong.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is a problem, and it also exists in the other direction (if something is negative it &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;has&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; to be wrong). I don&amp;amp;#39;t know what to do about it, but I&amp;amp;#39;ve never seen a community, except maybe hardcore followers of political figures, that was this extreme in this regard.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;tl;dr: crypto communities - here, on Twitter, everywhere - have a tendency to believe everything positive about crypto and not caring about it being debunked. this is problematic.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I fell for a simple bot scam where I transferred out of my wallet. I&amp;amp;#39;m too embarrassed to actually say how. I.. can&amp;amp;#39;t. (I ended up adding this in the comments) Just, don&amp;amp;#39;t be me. Don&amp;amp;#39;t be an idiot.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m writing this as a method to help myself cope. It&amp;amp;#39;s cathartic, but I don&amp;amp;#39;t know what else to do at the moment. This is probably one of the worst feelings I&amp;amp;#39;ve ever experienced.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: I&amp;amp;#39;d also like to add this isn&amp;amp;#39;t meant to be a pitty post. I can&amp;amp;#39;t actually explain how I feel currently outside of them term &amp;amp;quot;numb&amp;amp;quot;. I think I&amp;amp;#39;m trying to rationalize it more so with writing this out.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit 2: Thank you to some very kind folks. I&amp;amp;#39;m going to &amp;amp;quot;double&amp;amp;quot; down and get a part-time weekend job to pay this back to myself. Deserve it. But that&amp;amp;#39;s my way of making this a true lesson, with a good result in the end.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This makes it easy to attack, get your hands on a phone, start any chat app, and start typing any words off the BIP39 list, and see what the phone suggests. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

If price pierces through the colour it means the order has been filled, however orders can also be removed in which case the colour will disappear before price touches it (what happened in this case)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As most of you will know most of the &amp;amp;#39;whales&amp;amp;#39; trade on bitfinex, and this specific pictures I&amp;amp;#39;ve sent are from the bitfinex orderbooks. The same whale who purchased over 1600 coins from the prices between 37.5k down to 34.5 has taken profit from 45k-48k and had successfully rebought between 43.8k-40k. This type of orders are referred to as &amp;amp;#39;Iceberg orders&amp;amp;#39;   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However his remaining orders that remained unfilled from lower prices from the Ukraine invasion dip, he has now pulled from the market. These orders combine at over 1,000+ BTC total.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

We are mostly hopium injecting moon farmers here.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Truthfully the world is not in a good economic place right now, inflation is squeezing people&amp;amp;#39;s budgets, war and covid are creating supply shortages, rates are set to rise. It&amp;amp;#39;s a perfect storm.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The reality is people are having to adjust the budget and don&amp;amp;#39;t have much to spare. Discretionary expenses are the first to go and unfortunately poor old crypto, being a speculative high risk asset class is one of the first to have money taken out of it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you want the truth it will get much worse here short term before it gets better. I am bullish on the long term trajectory, but short term expect the suicide hotline to be pinned to the top of this sub soon.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
