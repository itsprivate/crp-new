&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m furious and disheartened to see the Canadian government move to disband patriotic protesters fighting for basic human freedom and choice.  Now Trudeau gives them the power to seize funds from crowd-funding sites &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;and banks&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; if they don&amp;amp;#39;t like what you stand for???  HOLY SHIT.  They say it&amp;amp;#39;s temporary, we shall see.  I know what I think about &amp;amp;quot;temporary emergency government measures&amp;amp;quot; based on historical context.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also, the SEC ruling over BlockFi that halts new interest accounts for any American that does not have at least $3m in investible assets is insane.  This will for sure spread to Voyager, Celsius, Gemini...etc.  I believe this is being done in coordination with banks to drive assets back to legacy institutions and prevent the ordinary person from achieving financial security and remain in a perpetual state of monetary slavery.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We are firmly in the &amp;amp;quot;..and then they fight you&amp;amp;quot; stage.  The walls are beginning to close in on ordinary citizens as their fears of being made irrelevant by this digital peaceful revolution increase.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We need truly decentralized protocols providing these type of financial services now more than ever.  Go get yourself a home mining rig for non-KYC bitcoin, spin up a full node on TOR, stack your sats like an animal, and dig in your heels.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The fight is upon us and I for one will die on the hill of financial freedom, choice, and sovereignty. I suggest you also act accordingly.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Rant over.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However, the FED are highly like going to have to make some real steps towards taking inflation in March.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Although a lot of those is already proced in, the extent of the damage to the economy is highly likely to mean a correction to interest rates above what was previously expected.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Of course, once that is over with there is a real chance of smooth sailing right up the bull market mountain again.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The CEO of the smartphone company came to the realization that Africans can afford smartphones but can&amp;amp;#39;t afford to pay for them all at once, which is why he wants to offer smartphones where you pay a larger sum at the beginning and then a monthly subscription fee. The subscription also includes a preinstalled tech stack, which will also include the Algorand Wallet. In addition, a neobank is being worked on. The neobank, which builds on Algorand, will offer a whole suite of financial products from insurance to loans. In addition, people will of course have access to the various Algorand projects such as supply chain management for farmers and so on.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The company is also working on licensing deals with other manufacturers such as Apple so that more smartphones can be offered. After one year, the smartphones will be upgraded automatically. The whole thing is to start soon in Tanzania.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/uof11fwz8zh81.png?width=2846&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e97ee0268ec502e5d8adb5a9aa93c018cdedc9ae&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/uof11fwz8zh81.png?width=2846&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e97ee0268ec502e5d8adb5a9aa93c018cdedc9ae&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then there is the fluctuation/ discrepancy with global market cap; atm CMC says the market cap is down 8% (stands at $1.72T), whereas Coingecko shows a +6% day (stands at $2.07T). $300B just disappears, only to reappear later in the day? Why does this happen? Almost every day I&amp;amp;#39;ve checked recently this has happened.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/ajag35049zh81.png?width=2846&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=5e38078c3bd2a37b41c9c9f3c18d11667d08aeaf&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/ajag35049zh81.png?width=2846&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=5e38078c3bd2a37b41c9c9f3c18d11667d08aeaf&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then there are the market cap rankings which on CMC for some reason exclude a great many from the top 100 even though their marketcaps are larger than those above them (is this opinion being injected into rankings or is this just a coding error?). The list down from the 90s to 100 is remarkably different between the two:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/2pvlt09h9zh81.png?width=2846&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=1cea6bf85b1ce6c3d0d9b2084ed2085ed3fed777&quot;&amp;gt;CMC&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/93ueas3i9zh81.png?width=2846&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=4ec4ab5f53edb30925a562f75c98f455f660fd41&quot;&amp;gt;Gecko&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then there are the rewards from collecting &amp;amp;#39;diamonds&amp;amp;#39; on CMC and the &amp;amp;#39;candies&amp;amp;#39; in Coingecko. This is a smaller quibble, but on CMC the options mainly consist of NFTs and promotions for other projects (and are mostly limited in quantity and time available), whereas Coingecko offers e-books for furthering understanding of crypto, and discount codes for VPNs and news sites (you know, something more functional than a picture of a cartoon lion) - and they don&amp;amp;#39;t appear to be limited (correct me if I&amp;amp;#39;m wrong). Of course it&amp;amp;#39;s effectively free (don&amp;amp;#39;t look a gift horse - or a DeRace NFT Horse - in the mouth, but there&amp;amp;#39;s a clear difference in tone between the two).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/3sscfdxl9zh81.png?width=2846&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=f84725a6270dcf7b8b1697b9d850d58d5cbc2284&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/3sscfdxl9zh81.png?width=2846&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=f84725a6270dcf7b8b1697b9d850d58d5cbc2284&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/5iebljnn9zh81.png?width=2846&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=043a822bd3687daef22a05b0b0f552058bc54506&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/5iebljnn9zh81.png?width=2846&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=043a822bd3687daef22a05b0b0f552058bc54506&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I guess my point is, considering CMC is the main site I see pushed for crypto rankings and info (not necessarily on this subreddit but definitely on social media in general), it falls short in multiple ways.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What&amp;amp;#39;s fascinating with crypto is that the code is open source. This means it&amp;amp;#39;s possible to see how active the developers for any project are.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Many well known projects are incredibly popular with devs. Thousands of new devs are joining the crypto space each year.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On the other hand, many other projects, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;collectively worth billions,&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; are effectively abandoned by their developers. Others have none or virtually no open source code to begin with.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here&amp;amp;#39;s the top 10 largest inactive projects by market cap that I found:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/skg9p29he0i81.jpg?width=650&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=adf9cc4d09da2a9181d7cd45b64615ba7e4889ec&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/skg9p29he0i81.jpg?width=650&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=adf9cc4d09da2a9181d7cd45b64615ba7e4889ec&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On average, projects in the top 500 market cap get updated 357 times a year by their devs. There are potentially hundreds of assets that don&amp;amp;#39;t appear to be updated anywhere near that level.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Many of the projects above haven&amp;amp;#39;t been updated a single time in the past year. Others just a handful of times. The &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://stack.money/article/abandoned-crypto-projects&quot;&amp;gt;full report is here&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; if you want to see each one in detail.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you&amp;amp;#39;re just trying to trade the hype, then this might not matter to you in the short term. Over a longer time period, though, the reality is bound to catch up with these &amp;amp;quot;dead&amp;amp;quot; projects. Investing in a project that is no longer being actively developed is clearly adding another layer of risk.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As always DYOR.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: The word &amp;amp;quot;popular&amp;amp;quot; in the title is causing some controversy, as it&amp;amp;#39;s obviously subjective. These are just the 10 largest by market cap. The total market cap of the 10 projects is over $3B, so clearly some people must still be holding a lot of these coins &amp;amp;amp; tokens.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

MineXmr (a supposedly infamous) mining pool, now owns &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://pools.xmr.wiki/&quot;&amp;gt;52% or more of network&amp;amp;#39;s hashrate&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. Know that Monero mining is special and has been touted to be more decentralized as it supports CPU mining, which has been the case so far. Even China&amp;amp;#39;s infamous ban, did not bring down network hashrate, just like it did to Bitcoin&amp;amp;#39;s 50% dip in hashrate.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However, in the past 24 hours alone, there has been close to 15% jump in the hashrate from 44% to 52% odd at mineXmr. This does not seem normal and has now become a major point of discussion that it could be seen as a deliberate attack on the network to double-spend.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The major problem is, the amounts spend/received cannot be deciphered, given it remains hidden on the Monero blockchain. Once hashrate has crossed 50%, anything is probable.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The ONLY trust factor is MineXmr owner remains loyal to the blockchain. Trustless has now become - trustful. And he is not willing to bog down, and he does not care and is willing to keep adding more hash power to his pool&amp;amp;#39;s throughput.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Really Sad!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;More more info, read here:&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/51-attack.asp&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/51-attack.asp&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;EDIT1: &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;51% Attack Real-World Examples&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Krypton and Shift, two blockchains based on &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ethereum.asp&quot;&amp;gt;Ethereum&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, suffered 51% attacks in August 2016.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In May of 2018, Bitcoin Gold, at the time the 26th-largest  cryptocurrency, suffered a 51% attack. The malicious actor or actors  controlled a vast amount of Bitcoin Gold&amp;amp;#39;s hash power, such that even with Bitcoin Gold repeatedly attempting to raise the exchange thresholds, the attackers were able to double-spend for several days, eventually stealing more than $18 million worth of Bitcoin Gold. Bitcoin Gold was hit again in 2020.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Recently, the Bitcoin SV (BSV) network suffered an attack in August 2021.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;EDIT2: An important comment by &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/MaZZeL3L/&quot;&amp;gt;MaZZeL3L&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yeah 51% attack is not a healthy thing and I wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t accept any payments as  final until a few blocks of confirmation but right now there&amp;amp;#39;s no real threat to the anonymity of transactions, nor the amount of coins in existence. they can&amp;amp;#39;t change consensus either.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;EDIT3: BEST explanation by &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/u/cndvcndv&quot;&amp;gt;u/cndvcndv&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If the miners keep that going, it&amp;amp;#39;s not gonna be great for them at all. No one will accept to get paid by XMR even for trades. That would cause the price to drop and reduce their profits. That&amp;amp;#39;s really reckless.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;From the perspective of other miners, they might feel scared that their blocks will be kicked out of the chain. I hope that doesn&amp;amp;#39;t cause them to move into mineXMR. I don&amp;amp;#39;t know how one would break that positive feedback loop unless the price hits bottom.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I love XMR; it&amp;amp;#39;s sad to see that happening.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

To be fair, I had stopped actively buying with them a year ago, but had decided not to sell since they had announced they were developing crypto wallets. So I decided to just hodl until I could transfer out... and that time has finally come! Last night I finally received word that my wallet was ready. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;As of this morning the remaining assets I has hodling have been transferred OUT!&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Screenshot: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/a/unzF2sS&quot;&amp;gt;https://imgur.com/a/unzF2sS&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;I STRONGLY urge you to do the same if you have not done so already.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; It&amp;amp;#39;s worth the gas price too (&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://ycharts.com/indicators/ethereum_average_gas_price&quot;&amp;gt;which is a little lower than normal right now&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;). If you&amp;amp;#39;ve quietly been waiting for your Robinhood crypto wallet, it should come soon. I was around number 55k in line to receive mine.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Why transfer out?&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; If you&amp;amp;#39;re not aware, Robinhood restricted trades during the the GameStop/meme-stock mania last year which effectively helped shady hedge funds and hurt regular folk like you and I (&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/investing/robinhood-backlash-what-you-should-know-about-the-gamestop-stock-controversy/&quot;&amp;gt;see more about that here&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;). They were also fined $70M by FINRA over other shady practices, including having &amp;amp;quot;outages&amp;amp;quot; during big market swings between 2018 and 2020 (&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/30/technology/robinhood-fined-misleading-customers.html&quot;&amp;gt;check that out here&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;). This was especially a frustration last year when Robinhood suddenly suffered &amp;amp;quot;technical difficulties&amp;amp;quot; during the epic Doge runup (&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419159/robinhood-dogecoin-outage-crypto-trading-crash#:%7E:text=Robinhood%20confirmed%20that%20it%20experienced,the%20beginning%20of%20the%20day&quot;&amp;gt;more info here&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;). So then, it&amp;amp;#39;s pretty clear that Robinhood&amp;amp;#39;s interests are NOT with you. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Why trust them with your assets when they block you from making financial decisions during critical market movements?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m not the only one in this sub that is alarmed by Robinhood, please see these additional posts and comments from our fellow sub-mates for more information so you can make your own decision:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TLDR: I finally moved all my crypto off Robinhood now that they enabled my crypto wallet. You should too because they are shady AF.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Super bowl typically has 100-120m viewers, so clearly it’s a big event. However the champions league final has a lot more, in 2021 700 million people watched Chelsea win. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This year is the World Cup finals as well, the final typically has 1 to 1.2 billion viewers, ten times more than the super bowl. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So will we see more big crypto ads for these events? Crypto.com already have a sponsorship deal with PSG who usually do well in the champions league. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Or is the super bowl special? Is advertising to the average American just significantly more valuable than the rest of the world?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;This is a great time to advocate for cryptocurrency as a way to keep these banks from accidentally or intentionally holding your money hostage.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To those who say &amp;amp;quot;It&amp;amp;#39;ll only affect a certain group I disagree with&amp;amp;quot;, with anything this broad and with no accountability, do you think they will err on the side of caution or will they start blanketing this policy far and wide?

The banks of course will comply and can freeze assets without any court order. Im not sure if its the people donating as well or if its donations over a certain sum but the point stands. The gov has the power to take your money as they see fit without any warning, and it wont be just the evil Russian/China governments doing so but the friendly Canadian one as well.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They are also trying to prevent crypto transactions. They can tell exchanges operating in Canada to freeze peoples accounts and of course the exchanges will have to comply just like the banks.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is why you never keep your money on the exchange, because tomorrow the gov could decide to freeze your money.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also a good reason to buy privacy coins like monero, although its going through a hiccup right now. But thats a different topic&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Not your keys not your coin&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also Im not for/against the protestors. Thats a political debate, Im pointing out the fact that the gov can just freeze peoples assets as they deem necessary. Maybe WW3 breaks out with Russia and the gov needs money to fund the military so they say 10% from everyone&amp;amp;#39;s account will be taken or whatever. Keep your coins safe.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I had most of my CRO locked up in the defi wallet and was in the process of waiting the 28 days to move it over. I had a few more just sitting in my regular wallet and figured I’d put them in the 6% staking for a few days since customer service had confirmed that they could be pulled out easily and added to my card stake:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/sr9sle8ilvh81.jpg?width=3024&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=fe7e751daa5c63c7cc0269387e7d32f74d1436cd&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/sr9sle8ilvh81.jpg?width=3024&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=fe7e751daa5c63c7cc0269387e7d32f74d1436cd&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I informed them that I had never received my original card from time to time and they assured me it was on its way and that it was just supply chain issues. Well, I kept checking in and they ultimately conceded that it was “lost”. This was a pretty big inconvenience, but I understood there were supply chain issues and was willing to give them a pass. I told the rep to just hold off on sending another card at that tier because I would be upgrading at the end of the month when my defi stake cleared: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The time comes, I message them a day ahead of time because I know how slow support can be. I want to make sure they’re ready when the defi stake comes over:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/x8tN4YX&quot;&amp;gt;https://imgur.com/x8tN4YX&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I noticed them taking an extraordinarily long time to update the stake, so I reached out to confirm that I would remain eligible if the market crashed in a few days. They confirmed this:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/I2qKpd0&quot;&amp;gt;https://imgur.com/I2qKpd0&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/slzi9jhnlvh81.jpg?width=3024&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=429c7d735fa96aa536c2bcadaea7ee16f4a0ce2b&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/slzi9jhnlvh81.jpg?width=3024&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=429c7d735fa96aa536c2bcadaea7ee16f4a0ce2b&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Even more time goes by. At this point I think it’s day 2 or 3 of messaging support for updates. Then I get the message below where they claim I’m no longer eligible:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I continue to explain to the CSR that this account has already been locked in and that it’s a done deal. There must be some confusion on their end. I let them know that if they wait for another three days, I may no longer be eligible so it’s very important the account is noted as already locked in. The only reason it has been updated yet is because support is dragging their feet:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/cKGE0Qt&quot;&amp;gt;https://imgur.com/cKGE0Qt&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Finally, they get it together and confirm that my new card has been issued and will be received in 7-14 days. It was a huge time sink even getting to this point, but at least it was done: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/mtlKsdW&quot;&amp;gt;https://imgur.com/mtlKsdW&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Or so I thought… After about another day or two of waiting and asking why my status hasn’t changed, I get this: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/jGUULS3&quot;&amp;gt;https://imgur.com/jGUULS3&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They took away my card and are refusing to correct the situation.  Honestly, I don’t know what I expected. I feel kind of foolish for trusting a company like this in the first place.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TLDR:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto.com support bounced me around for days without resolution. In my circumstance, they never sent my original card. After they flubbed that, they confirmed an upgrade was taking place and then never updated my account. Ultimately, they waited 4 days until the market crashed and knocked me out of eligibility for the upgrade despite already promising the new card had shipped and card stake was locked.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I gave this thing my best shot, but decided that this a company that only cares about advertising and onboarding more customers. They could care less about existing customers. This is just my opinion based on my own experiences.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto.com wasn’t a good fit for me as I found the customer support to be dishonest and lacking in accountability. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This took a lot of time to write up and I didn&amp;amp;#39;t do so just to rustle the feathers of CRO investors. I genuinely hope the best for them, but I do feel it&amp;amp;#39;s important that people know what &amp;amp;quot;support&amp;amp;quot; is like with this company.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To make this clear; This bug was not found on layer 1, it was a second layer, called &amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.optimism.io&quot;&amp;gt;Optimism&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;. And therefore this could not have been used to print unlimited Ether.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If something like this happens on a second layer - you can have unlimited Ether on it. But as soon as you try to convert back to layer 1, at some point the locked ETH will be fully drained. If it&amp;amp;#39;s not already noticed by then, now everyone will see this layer is broken, and it will simply collapse. Basically all ETH locked on that layer 2 project is possibly lost to the hacker - however no real damage is done to the main chain, at least in terms of blockchain integrity.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;tl;dr: top post right now is misleading as fuck. There was no bug on the main layer of Ethereum, this only happened on some layer 2 project. Read the articles.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Spending 16M for an ad and the just putting on a QR-Code for the site, something everyone had access to, seems like a meme that they made themselves. But it&amp;amp;#39;s actually a lot more. It&amp;amp;#39;s what crypto needs to most:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Simplicity.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Showing just a QR code on a black screen. So already an ad we all could have made in minutes. Simple. You just have to scan that ad with your fun and boom you are all ready for Crypto trading. Or even investing in general as even that is seen and complicated.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto is seen by most people as something over the top complicated tech thing. That&amp;amp;#39;s a reputation that at the beginning is going to help but it won&amp;amp;#39;t let mass adoption happen. Many people don&amp;amp;#39;t trade crypto because they think it&amp;amp;#39;s just too complicated. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And in today&amp;amp;#39;s world people will just do what&amp;amp;#39;s fast and easy to do. Making crypto have that reputation is going to help a LOT with mass adoption.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But obviously that does not change that coinbase was literally not capable of setting up more servers so that their site does not crash minutes later.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Coinbase spending $16,000,000 on a Superbowl Ad to direct people to their website and $0 to make sure that website doesn&amp;amp;#39;t crash 10 seconds after the ad starts is do very internet&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Exchanges are willingly spending huge lot of money on their marketing and all,but they don&amp;amp;#39;t want to spend a dollar to make sure their customer gets the best service.All they want is new customers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s not just one exchange, most of the Crypto exchanges are doing the same.If they will spend even half of the marketing money to improve their customer service, improve their website,to give customers best experience they might get more customers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There are people saying BTC will eventually hit 1 million. I am not saying it will or it will not, that is another post for itself. All I know is it will go up. That 0.28 stash of yours will increase its own value data by day (in the grand scheme of things). I do not have that much BTC yet but I plan to join the 0.28 BTC group eventually. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Imagine years down the line all millionaires would want to own a BTC and there are not enough to pass around. Your 0.28 BTC value will skyrocket when it happens. So keep staking and lend out your BTC too to let your BTC make more BTC for you. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That will be all folks.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
