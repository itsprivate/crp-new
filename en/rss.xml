&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There are many examples but the process of ordering an Uber/Lyft is one where the concept is very simple and understandable (hailing a cab) but may be difficult to explain to someone 30 years ago as so much technology has built on top of itself to allow it. (High speed internet, smart phones, apps, GPS, etc.)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What simple task today will be done in a completely new fashion in 2-3 decades as the technology infrastructure of crypto/blockchain continues to be built out?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: Not sure why some are hung up on the Uber example. Its not the point of the post folks.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They never want to target cases or companies that are difficult, challenging, or embarrassing. They’re an agency that polices broken windows on the street level and rarely goes to the penthouse floors!         &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They contact blockchain businesses that are holding token sales and force them to close and refund investors. They claim to “maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation” but play nice to big corporations, while employees take very high paying private sector jobs after working there!            &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They shells out billions and billions of fines each year but a large number of those fines go to big banks, some of the most evil companies on earth!!        &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Their enforcement division is measured by only two metrics, the number of cases filed and the monetary penalties - more than half of SEC employees are made up of enforcement personnel and examination staff - they need serious reallocation of their resources! Enough is enough!! Gary you might have taught that MIT class but you have no business &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;‘regulating’&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; the future of global finance!        &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TLDR; &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The SEC is a useless government body that does NOTHING to actually protect investors&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, only favors big business, and should stay the HELL away from cryptocurrencies.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

These blockchain-based monetizations of the gaming experience are effectively play-to-earn crypto games. Players play to gain prizes rather than to win, which is what sets them apart from typical games. The ability to compensate players for their time and effort is, unsurprisingly, at the root of the quick rise in popularity of these play-to-earn games, often known as GameFi. Who wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t want to make money while having a good time? The future of gaming is PlayToEarn. While playing games, users must earn NFTs or crypto tokens!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency has seen a spike in interest this year ahead of a widely anticipated shift to a proof-of-stake (PoS) model. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;ETH price has surged over 20% in the past two weeks, and was trading at around $3,400- close to breaking even for the year. Daily volumes have also steadily risen, averaging at roughly $20 billion over the past week.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;BTC price also shot up to 2022 highs this week, and was trading around $47,000. But while volumes did increase, they were substantially lower than the massive amounts of liquidity seen in 2021. Still, the world’s largest cryptocurrency commanded over 40% of total crypto market capitalization.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But the latest crypto rally has also seen several altcoins vastly outperform BTC, while notching record highs in market capitalization. A similar scenario was observed during the start of the 2021 rally, which had eventually challenged BTC’s dominance.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And so the question is will &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://getblock.io/nodes/eth/?utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;amp;utm_campaign=promo&quot;&amp;gt;ETH&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; lead the next Bull Run?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you’re interested in going anywhere, it’ll cost you about 40% more than this time last year just to fill up your gas tank. And that’s only the tip of the iceberg…&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

A token with high trading fees which were supposed to go towards the cost of paying people to work towards getting businesses to accept crypto. It gets a lot worse…&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He partnered with another guy Myles G that was previously in prison for &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://miami.cbslocal.com/2011/05/18/men-trick-woman-steal-her-rolex/&quot;&amp;gt;fraud and robbery&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; at gunpoint… (what could go wrong? SMH)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He initially tried to call it Accept Doge but The Dogecoin Foundation pulled their trademark card and stopped him from doing it on the threat of &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/billym2k/status/1506443665245413382?s=21&amp;amp;amp;t=3gkaxm-DminXh7TsC9lomA&quot;&amp;gt;legal action.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Dogecoin Community has been angry at Matt for weeks/months about this and other things as he is also a prominent Dogecoin Pumper that pushes unfounded rumors in his Twitter and YouTube channel.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This isn’t the first time he’s done something like this, other tokens of his have also been rugpulled. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/baby-lambo-inu/&quot;&amp;gt;Baby Lambo Inu&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Once trading started it acted as a honeypot, people could buy but couldn’t sell. A few short periods allowed trading as liquidity was drained. A total of $600K+ in ETH was drained from the project.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here is a recording of the Telegram call with his Patreon supporters right after they found out &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-s1Q7ErBoBM&quot;&amp;gt;they couldn’t sell and later exit liquidity was drained&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Allegedly it was supposed to be a fair launch but it went live for his patron supporters first and they were advocating in private channels to buy and dump on the greater market once it was live for everyone.

I believe that netflix in  recent years has become one of the companies with the most power of influence, alongside META. Every Netflix series, film and documentary  has a hidden agenda or at least subliminal messages that always point to the same ideology, and worst of it all ... is that they are very good at  doing this.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I don&amp;amp;#39;t want to make this a political issue or spread  conspiracy theories because I&amp;amp;#39;m here to talk about the new Netflix  series &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Trust No One: The Hunt For The Crypto King&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; the title itself  already tells us the message they want to get across. The documentary  tells the story of the alleged bankruptcy of Canada&amp;amp;#39;s largest crypto  broker, and for someone who understands the concepts of crypto watching  the documentary is almost impossible, they try to look impartial and  factual but it becomes clear that they are not.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They  begin by framing what Bitcoin is to the viewer, the biggest reasoning for the people who invest in BTC is just &amp;amp;quot;rebelling against the system&amp;amp;quot;, they refusing to talk about key topics like decentralization, inflation, too much government power, security  or even the concept of limited supply.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/0mtvsm5zuhq81.jpg?width=599&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=6bf5d93c97abf298d07bd290d1ee0ea5ce5a099e&quot;&amp;gt;Why the bloody fingerprint tho?&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For the average person this what  BTC is, a virtual currency that people grab by faith or rebellion, if  Bitcoin is so recognized and even so it is so useless imagine what the  average person will think of other cryptocurrencies in an industry that  is advertised as a ponzi scheme and a world full of scams, But I&amp;amp;#39;m  rambling already. This is the &amp;amp;quot;good&amp;amp;quot; part of the documentary, from there  Netflix uses all the dirty tricks to manipulate the viewer.. Those who  invest in crypto:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;do not have time to exercise&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;are nerds&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;are looking to get rich fast&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;want to buy luxury cars (this is partially true)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;have no basic understanding of markets or how money works&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;are naive and easily manipulated (I see the irony)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They interview a guy that wanted to get rich fast as his friend did, so he asks for a high interest loan of the value of 85k$, what happens? he buys BTC high and the price crashes (typical redditor investor s/), he now is fu****, has to sell his house... but that is not enough, he proceeds to send 400k to the exchange with the intention to avoid bank fees, and now he lost all his money on QuadrigaCX scam...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This  documentary is a shameful attack on crypto but there is something good to pull out of here, Netflix and the big media have to resort to these  strategies because in a debate of ideas they lose.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They may try to postpone crypto, but they&amp;amp;#39;re postponing the inevitable, I just  feel bad for the people who are manipulated by these kinds of  documentaries.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thank you for your attention, I don&amp;amp;#39;t advise you to watch this , I wasted my time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

You don&amp;amp;#39;t see that too often, so I was curious when it happened last, and how rare it really is. So I looked into it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the past 10 years, BTC had (at least) 8 consecutive green days in a row only 16 times, most of them in the very early days. 7 of those were in 2012, 2 in 2013, 2 in 2015, and once each each year from 2016 to 2021, except 2018. The longest streak ever was in 2012 (15 days), after 2012 the longest streak was 10 days (happened twice, once in 2013 and once only last year, in July 2021).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That means that BTC only needs two more green candles to tie the record for after 2012 - and one more to break it. As I am writing this, the daily candle is slightly green again, but it&amp;amp;#39;s very close. Let&amp;amp;#39;s hope for green days all week, let&amp;amp;#39;s make this the longest streak in 10 years!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

One post in particular argued that centralisation is needed from the start of a project&amp;amp;#39;s journey to encourage development. I believe that decentralisation is the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;ONLY&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; point of crypto and should be sought out as a priority and not be a future promise. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto has so many comparable non-crypto centralised alternatives, which can provide the same features. Here is a small list of features that crypto can offer, and a centralised/non-crypto alternative:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Store of Value - Gold/Silver/general commodities&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Transfer of money - PayPal/CashApp/Payoneer&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Yield products - Bonds/Some investment trusts/REITs&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Investment opportunities - Stock market/Private Equity/Fine Art&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;NFTs - ownership papers&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Privacy - Cash (admittedly weak, I’m not an XMR shill I promise)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I’m sure I’m missing a few, but my point is that one can access all of these features in a centralised manner. What crypto offers is the ability to access all of these features in a trustless way. I.e. You no longer rely on PayPal to “allow” you to send and withdraw money, it is all done by the network instead. The only differentiating factor between these centralised options and crypto is that crypto does not rely on companies/middle men.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;All other features of a crypto, say fast speed, low fees, and any other great technical advancements, are just a means to make the decentralised product better, but are not the main feature by any means.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Take BTC. It sits at #1 because it is the best store of value of any crypto, but the reason it has any value in the first place is because it is decentralised.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Bitcoin has nearly a trillion dollar market cap and is the 9th most valuable asset in the world. I wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t call that being &amp;amp;quot;early&amp;amp;quot; anymore. Ethereum is #20. Large companies are now buying these assets. The days of 100x your money in a year is basically over. As for the shitcoins that do do that, look at the volume at the start. Barely anyone was trading back then.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Do I think there is still a lot of room for crypto to grow? Yes, but this isn&amp;amp;#39;t 2011 anymore. Most people who buy now aren&amp;amp;#39;t going to make insane gains and that&amp;amp;#39;s just the truth of it. There are ~18,000 shitcoins in existence now, back in 2011 there were maybe 5. And the industry just started back then, now it&amp;amp;#39;s been around for 12 years. Much different ballgame now than it was back then. I&amp;amp;#39;d say we are somewhere in the middle. Big gains can still be made but don&amp;amp;#39;t make the mistake of thinking this is 2011 and expecting a 1000x in one year.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: clearly people missed the point. We are relatively early, but the way some people are talking, they think they can turn $1,000 into $1,000,000. We are at a level where I could reasonably see most coins doing a 10-20X in 10 years. Amazing returns, but unless you put a ton in, not Ultra-rich&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Don&amp;amp;#39;t know about you but having something as a world currency that occasionally does a 10x up and down, seems chaotic to say the least.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And I personally think it&amp;amp;#39;s completly okay to see Crypto as a investment than a currency right now. But I would also say that at one point Crypto will be so big that it would be stabke on the price. Meaning we won&amp;amp;#39;t see any major dips but also not any 10x or so over a short period. This may be the only way of Crypto as a currency.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Obviously we all want to make some money but the greater cause of Crypto wouod not fulfill that. And I&amp;amp;#39;m ready that one day Crypto won&amp;amp;#39;t be as fun as today but more useful to everyone.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now there is almost $600m  worth coins stolen from this shit show that the hacker will be looking to dump. While CEX have blacklisted the hacker&amp;amp;#39;s address already, nothing is stopping him from dumping all of it on DEX. He can play with the market though cashing out would seem difficult at this point. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Even Tornado cash is not 100% fool proof, as the recent NFT rugpull bust by DOJ suggests.. In that case the rug pull scammers used tornado to wash their coins but still got caught.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In this case it seems the hacker is already sending funds to CEX which means he is most likely KYCed or using fakes..&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Who doesn&amp;amp;#39;t have them these days. And we all have tons of apps for our portfolio management. We got our FIAT banking apps, we got the CEX apps. we got wallet apps and then browser for accessing the ones that don&amp;amp;#39;t have a dedicated app and finally logged into our account and an authenticator app.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With so many apps and so many passwords I bet you that we all have unknowingly used save password or better copy pasted or clicked a photo of our seed phrase. So many internet and crypto etiquttes are broken just for the sake of convinience.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When does this come to bite our behind ?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The first obvious one is losing our phone. But you know, accidents like dropping it in water and damage usually destroy it or once we lose it it runs out of charge. Even then, getting into it requires passords or some biometrics. And we can remotely lock our devices too if someone where to get in.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But what if I bring to your imagination a nightmare even more simple ? You have to give your phone for service. Now we all aren&amp;amp;#39;t the richest people in the world and definitely I am not. After dropping my phone and cracking the screen, the first thing I do is see if I can still use it with the display still cracked.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To my dismay, I saw rainbows and a epiliptic touchscreen that refused to obey. The next course of action is to curse a few suitable words and then look up the price of servicing it. Oh boy, a week to service and half the phone&amp;amp;#39;s cost to do it. Hell no. And buying a new one is even more expensive.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And here is the conundrum. I go and give it for service at the local shop that uses questionable parts but is cheaper and will get it done by the next day.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But here&amp;amp;#39;s the kicker, they need my phone&amp;amp;#39;s password.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;And that my friend is the stake through the heart.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Immediately I tell them &amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Actually let me just quickly go home and get the money for this&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; and go back home to assess my options &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;AKA steps to secure your funds&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Sign out of Google:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; This will ensure that your authenticator will be disabled as well as accessing your cloud data is disabled as well. No accessing your password manager so your sins are forgiven.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Sign out of your CEX:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Not all CEX have this so verify now the ones that you use allow you to remotely signout of your accounts. This is needed in case your phone&amp;amp;#39;s display or touch fails&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Remove your SIM card:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; If you have a physical SIM card, remove it. This will prevent them from trying to access through SMS 2 factor authentication which a lot of CEX and banking apps use by default.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Block withdrawls:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; If you can block withdrawls for a certain amount of time then better do that until you get your phone back.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Delete seed phrase images or copy pastes:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; If you can access the cloud backup and delete it then better do it.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;If you have the seed phrase as a local file on your phone then you are pretty much screwed. Someone can simply download metamask and use your seedphrase.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So there, this was one hell of a 24 hours for me and gladly it seems they didn&amp;amp;#39;t tamper with my phone. But it really did hit me like a hammer when I went to the shop and finally before giving the phone they asked for my password.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hope this made you think twice of your security status. And stay safe everyone&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Well he was also super for Canada locking bankaccounts of terrorists. (Which I get. I felt like the government was showing why decentralization was important and them locking accounts should not be allowed.) &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I told him it was a direct response to the events in Canada and he should just hold a cold wallet or something. He went on about it being too far and punishing normal people for a few bad apples. I said this is what people mean when they talk about a slippery slope. How would you identify those individuals face cameras? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Long story short. Don&amp;amp;#39;t be okay with governments punishing people that you don&amp;amp;#39;t politically agree with. Eventually you may be on the other end or lumped up with them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

They launched the token this past Friday and were supposed to set a low max buy limit but somehow mess this up, allowing some investors to purchase more than almost 100x than they should have. Once the devs caught their mistake they reset the buy limit and announced that they would blacklist the wallets that were able to purchase the larger amounts.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One of the persons who got blacklisted found an exploit with Saitamask and drained all of the liquidity out of the SaitaRealty LP. He bragged about it on Twitter and got away with at least $1.2 million that investors put into the new project. He did so without touching the SaitaReality he bought with the blacklisted wallet. No one that bought SaitaRealty can cash out now as there is 0 liquidity left. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Somehow the thief was able to trick Saitamask into swapping ETH for 10x the amount of Saitama he should have received and then swap that for SaitaRealty all in one transaction. He then Swapped back the SaitaRealty for Saitama, cashed that out to ETH, and transferred the ETH to another wallet to tumble.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here is a screenshot of the instant 10X he was able to trick the Saitamask router into doing:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://etherscan.io/tx/0x18bd50dc00ef034bcf28480e8744e8af4150155353846fb8fe36d7af56071139&quot;&amp;gt;https://etherscan.io/tx/0x18bd50dc00ef034bcf28480e8744e8af4150155353846fb8fe36d7af56071139&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here is the wallet he did the exploit with if you want to see how it all went down:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://etherscan.io/address/0xad0c834315abfa7a800bbbb5d776a0b07b672614&quot;&amp;gt;https://etherscan.io/address/0xad0c834315abfa7a800bbbb5d776a0b07b672614&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here is the wallet he used to tumble the stolen funds with.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://etherscan.io/address/0x63493e679155c2f0aad5bf96d65725ad6427fac4&quot;&amp;gt;https://etherscan.io/address/0x63493e679155c2f0aad5bf96d65725ad6427fac4&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The thief deleted his Twitter account but here is a screenshot of a post he made about what he did. Note that PeckShield Inc. from his quote tweet is a crypto-security company that tried to alert the team about what was happening. The Saitama team did not realize what was happing until all the money was gone, even though security experts tried to warn them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/k4gih0nar8q81.png?width=464&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=6b9c92d61d17f6ced8c898b7438fd7a2195dfb8d&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/k4gih0nar8q81.png?width=464&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=6b9c92d61d17f6ced8c898b7438fd7a2195dfb8d&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Saitama devs hosted a Twitter space the next day and claimed that the thief was running arbitrage through Uniswap. This is not what happed and anyone who can understand transactions on Ethescan can clearly see that their claim is false. The instant 10x exploit happed directly and fully through the Saitamask router.  All of these transactions happened fully within Saitamask contracts as you can see in the transaction above. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The devs know all of this and are covering it up. The fact that the devs are sweeping this under the rug and have kept the swap open seems criminal to me. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here you can see the liquidity is completely gone and investors are currently unable cash out:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/lz1zfwpfr8q81.png?width=2830&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=73bc18e2d3c178f37950834f21d3de9f381c2d6b&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/lz1zfwpfr8q81.png?width=2830&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=73bc18e2d3c178f37950834f21d3de9f381c2d6b&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you got this far how do you think the devs should have handled this? While all of this was going on the devs were actively encourage Saitama holders to take part in a listing competition with OKX, and they will now be listed there.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As the title says, I&amp;amp;#39;m giving away a bunch of VINU to everyone who comments on this thread! &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;As well, we will giveaway 5x100$ prizes!&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;What is VINU?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Vita Inu (VINU) is the world&amp;amp;#39;s first zero-fee, light-speed, dog coin with smart contracts!&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is a token built on the Vite network in November 2021 by Vite enthusiasts. Much like Nano (XNO), Vite is a DAG network with near-instant transaction times and zero fees. But in addition to that, Vite is the first public chain to implement smart contracts on the basis of a DAG ledger. Because of this, VINU is the world&amp;amp;#39;s first dog coin with near-instant transaction times, zero fees, and smart contracts! VINU is also proudly the #1 project on the Vite chain.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;VINU&amp;amp;#39;s philosophy is to provide education about cryptocurrencies in a fun and ethical way. It does so by building a fun and engaging community around the cryptocurrency project. It is also currently sponsoring a&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/i_fly_high_/status/1507916290706456577&quot;&amp;gt; blockchain awareness program in India&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; (and previously&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/VitaInuCoin/status/1469982262066176005&quot;&amp;gt; Nepal&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;), and will continue to do more for blockchain awareness elsewhere on the globe.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;VINU is unlike other memecoins. First, VINU is committed to paying all its community members fairly for their contributions to the project. Members receive VINU as rewards for moderating social media and community platforms, organising events, creating artwork, and so on. Second, VINU leans into transparency in legal compliance, with legal opinions valid in the EU and US. Last but not least, VINU is committed to the fair distribution of a significant portion of its total supply.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;VINU even has its own &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;tipbot&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; right here on Reddit, where our community can tip tokens without transaction fees &amp;amp;amp; you’ll see it in action in the comments and over at our subreddit!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here’s some of VINU’s achievements in the past five months since its creation:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;And there’s much more planned for the project – including a &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;metaverse (“Vinuverse”)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; with a full &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;VR World&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, a &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;decentralized swap (“VinuSwap”)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;NFTs&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Games&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, and more.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As you can see, VINU is clearly one of the top dogs!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Our friendly neighborhood community moderators will be ready to help you!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;NOTE: We would be remiss not to point out that we’ve been hugely inspired by the Nano giveaways on this sub in the past. In fact, Vite and VINU were created to allow &amp;amp;quot;feeless &amp;amp;amp; instant&amp;amp;quot; to be brought to Web3, and a significant number of team members from both projects were/are active Nano community members.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;EDIT:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;- Didn&amp;amp;#39;t receive a reply after posting your Vite address? This may be because the accounts making the comments have been rate-limited by Reddit. You should still have received your rewards. Verify all successful transactions here:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://vitcscan.com/address/vite_68e5d1a2e3913c31628841cc54d67da6bcf2beb4eb5860663a&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;http://vitcscan.com/address/vite_68e5d1a2e3913c31628841cc54d67da6bcf2beb4eb5860663a&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;- Didn&amp;amp;#39;t receive your VINU? This may be because the script that&amp;amp;#39;s handling the giveaway is stalling. We&amp;amp;#39;ll be monitoring its activity throughout the day, but there may be some gaps here and there. You&amp;amp;#39;ll receive your VINU, regardless!&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;- Getting an error from the faucet? This may be because your account is entirely new, and unopened. Once you receive your VINU from this giveaway, you should be able to start using the faucet.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
