&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s disgusting how she basically admits that Corporate money and influence dictate everything. Walmart, Amazon, and other large corporations fund social welfare programs that their workers use in order to deprive them of a living wage and healthcare. Cryptocurrency allows us to break free of this financial bondage and turns the whole system on it&amp;amp;#39;s head.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Truly decentralized cryptocurrency has the potential to revolutionize everything. It can allow for everyone&amp;amp;#39;s vote to matter and have input on the changes society needs. It can allow for efficient and transparent tax allocation so anyone and everyone can audit and keep the system accountable to the people.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Trustless and public block chains are the only way I see to get dark corporate money out of politics.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto isn&amp;amp;#39;t just some novel niche tech, it has the potential to be the catalyst for economic and political revolution. If we can successfully integrate a truly decentralized financial protocol, it changes the dynamics of rich nations to poor nations, rich people to poor people.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I really hope humanity can use cryptocurrency to better society and eliminate the asymmetry&amp;amp;#39;s of power that Corporations, and people like Janet Yellen abuse.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Nayib Bukele chose Bitcoin to try to change the future of his country. Under the current system, El Salvador was condemned to survive by begging for aid from the IMF or the World Bank.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Nayib Bukele understood the why of Bitcoin and decided to seize this opportunity to change the future of El Salvador and its people. The people of El Salvador overwhelmingly support Nayib Bukele in what he is trying to do for the country.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;El Salvador&amp;amp;#39;s bold choice has already changed the way the country is seen around the world. Everyone is talking about El Salvador and more and more entrepreneurs will be coming to El Salvador to participate in this experiment of building the first Bitcoin Nation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Who knew where El Salvador was before Nayib Bukele made this choice? Very few people. No one was talking about El Salvador. Bitcoin is already a game-changer for El Salvador and this is clearly just the beginning.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While the IMF or the World Bank scoffed at Bitcoin a few years ago, now these institutions are getting scared by the growing possibility that the Bitcoin experiment will succeed in El Salvador and motivate other countries to follow Nayib Bukele&amp;amp;#39;s path.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Tonga is talking about adopting Bitcoin by the end of 2022, as are other countries in South and Central America. In short, something is happening and the IMF feels the danger mounting for its obsolete system.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Rather than letting the people determine for themselves, the IMF is threatening El Salvador saying the country must abandon Bitcoin. The IMF&amp;amp;#39;s threats only justify, in my opinion, the very existence of Bitcoin and the absolute necessity for the world to have this alternative system available.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Since El Salvador will logically refuse to obey the IMF, what&amp;amp;#39;s next? Will America eventually orchestrate a coup in El Salvador to overthrow the government and end the Bitcoin experiment? How far are the powerful people in the current system willing to go to prevent countries from expressing their free will in monetary and financial matters?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;El Salvador must continue to resist outside pressure, and other countries that will join the Bitcoin adventure in 2022 must do the same. The world is changing, and the first countries to adopt Bitcoin will be the ones to benefit the most in the future.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

When it comes to value, they probably didn&amp;amp;#39;t understand the ecosystem and use cases of (not shitcoins) crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For someone like me, I did a lot of trading and utilized a lot of different exchanges and wallets (which of course wasn’t a good idea).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I also use a coin tracker and records to keep track of my gains and losses. I started with &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://koinly.io/?r=1&quot;&amp;gt;Koinly&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, but because I didn&amp;amp;#39;t want to pay for the tax reports, I switched to &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://crypto.com/?r=1&quot;&amp;gt;Crypto.com&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and their tax tool. I experienced the same problem with both of them. I then discovered that &amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://cryptotaxcalculator.io/?r=1&quot;&amp;gt;CryptoTaxCalculator&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; was a lot more accurate at recognizing transactions than Koinly.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But seriously though, this just makes government bankers and politicians hypocrites if they make people pay taxes on crypto if they consider it a useless asset and that they&amp;amp;#39;ll receive a part of their paycheck from taxes collected from crypto. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To have intrinsic value, something does not have to be a &amp;amp;quot;physical asset&amp;amp;quot; like gold or have &amp;amp;quot;official&amp;amp;quot; government support or acknowledgment. From a philosophical and practical standpoint, the whole argument that it has no intrinsic worth is a ridiculous slippery slope.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I tried stocks for around 4 years and it never really felt something native to my generation (Gen Z). Overall I believe in crypto more, but I recognize the risks involved with it as I&amp;amp;#39;ve been dabbling in them since 2017.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;ve been looking into stablecoins and generating passive yields with these, but I want to find something which has some form of insurance or low risk of the money suddenly disappearing due to a hack or similar. Basically, I want to be sure that my inheritance money won&amp;amp;#39;t disappear within the next 3-5 years minimum, and ideally, I want to be able to take out a portion of the yield to live off of.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I do own a hardware wallet so I would be ok with storing the funds there. I found a stablecoin called OUSD, which seems to cover my needs together with an added 3rd party insurance, but the protocol does not seem to be that known and has USDT exposure, which is why I am a little bit hesitant as of right now. I&amp;amp;#39;m happy to hear if anyone has positive experience with it though. I am also happy to hear if anyone has other recommendations on what you would do with $200k to create a yield to live off of.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I am based in Europe (in case there are any CEX recommendations that only have US-specific insurances).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: People are telling me to be careful with DMs, funnily enough it did indeed blow up but I&amp;amp;#39;ve been in the game long enough to know not to click anything, thanks everyone!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Lets use bitcoin for example, its at about 36.5k right now. If I have $10,000 to spend, I don&amp;amp;#39;t want to just wait until it drops a bit and just spend the $10,000 all at once. I start edging in, just in case it goes lower to protect me from volatility. I set up buy orders:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;$1,000 at 34k&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;$2,000 at 32k&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;$3,000 at 30k&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;$4,000 at 28k&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This isn&amp;amp;#39;t perfect, but it has protected me from volatility a bit and certainly stopped me from dropping all my money on a coin at a higher price.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: Some people are saying this is DCAing. Dollar Cost Averaging is investing money at certain intervals regardless of the price. For my example it would be like $1000 a month over the next 10 months&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That made me wonder why it is called &amp;amp;quot;dead cat bounce&amp;amp;quot;. 
Is it a dead bounce from a living cat? 
Is it because the graph looks like a dead cat? 
Is it because a cat just like a chicken can bounce around for a little bit even when dead?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So I Googles it, and now you don&amp;amp;#39;t have to waste 30 seconds of graph staring or reddit scrolling, to do it yourself.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What I found is that it is called a &amp;amp;quot;dead cat bounce&amp;amp;quot; because of the old saying: &amp;amp;quot;even a dead cat will bounce if you drop it from high enough&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Seems pretty grim to me, but that&amp;amp;#39;s why it is called what it&amp;amp;#39;s called.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A good reason to invest in them is because they are considered as blue chips. For those who don&amp;amp;#39;t know, a blue chip corporation is one that is financially stable. In this case, we&amp;amp;#39;re talking about cryptos, and a blue chip coin is one that has a market capital of more than $ 2 billion.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Another reason to invest in them is because of it’s support to projects like Qtum and Envision which brings the best of both coins mentioned in this &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://cryptobullsclub.com/best-innovative-peer-to-peer-exchange-networks/&quot;&amp;gt;article&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. When BTC rises, your entire portfolio climbs with it. Investing in BTC and ETH is equivalent to investing in the entire cryptocurrency market which also means that BTC and ETH also drive the market. Reinforcing the market and increasing the safety of your subsequent bets.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yes, neither BTC nor ETH will offer you fast riches, but they both promise decent returns and allow you to hedge your bets. Everyone has a varied risk tolerance for a variety of reasons; there is no shame in aligning yours with the relative stability of BTC or ETH. You&amp;amp;#39;d still have ETH and BTC working for you even if you lost your insane risky investment.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I can understand why : stupid apes jpegs and the &amp;amp;quot;crypto-bro&amp;amp;quot; subculture is kinda annoying.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But here is what a lot of people need to understand : NFTs are much, much more than jpegs. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s a piece of technology that has the potential to revolutionize a lot of things in our daily digital lives.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Let me illustrate my point. Last week, there was an ETH hackaton organized by ETHglobal. In two days, participants created 255 different projects related to NFTs. Here&amp;amp;#39;s some very interesting projects that have nothing to do with &amp;amp;quot;stupid jpegs&amp;amp;quot; :&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Creativerse, a Minecraft server connected to Ethereum where lands and buildings are turned into NFTs - that means that nobody can censor you. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;0xPhotos, a stock photography marketplace that enable creators to get royalties everytime their photo is used. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;veNFT, a DeFi projects that gives rewards to owners willing to stake their NFT. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;ENS-Signature, which aim to integrate Ethereum Universal Sign-In into official documents such as DocuSigns. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I think I&amp;amp;#39;ve made my point : we are in the very early stages of a groundbreaking technology going mainstream. In ten years, those of us who choose to invest in this sector will be called &amp;amp;quot;lucky&amp;amp;quot; by the very same people that are laughing at NFTs right now.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Keep your mind open. Don&amp;amp;#39;t believe the lies ignorant people are telling you. DYOR, and you will see a lot of opportunities. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;NFTs will be everywhere in our digital lives in less than a decade.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is strange how many in here bash cardano. I mean if someone wants free moons you can title your post &amp;amp;quot;cardano is overrated&amp;amp;quot; and a flood of praises will follow.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cardano has many advantages comparing to other L1 projects:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Academic team who are actively researching new horizons and publishing papers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Novel double layer architecture.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It has Great security.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;4.it is extremely sustainable and environment friendly.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It almost entirely decentralized.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is one of the few top projects with low share of its coins in the hands of whales (if I remember more than 80% was owned by small hodlers).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;transaction are fast and very cheap.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;An increasing number of developers are using its blockchain.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For all it this pros and many more, the only cons I heard about is the recent congestion which almost any crowded blockchain experienced so far. People forgive ETH for practically everything but cardano is bad because of a congestion? Or because it didn&amp;amp;#39;t grow much in market value? 
Or is it another reason which I missed? Like annoying fan base?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I really think ADA doesn&amp;amp;#39;t deserve so much hate. It is a solid project with a really nice team and it might have a bright future ahead of it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I don&amp;amp;#39;t know if &amp;amp;quot;irony&amp;amp;quot; is the right word since it&amp;amp;#39;s not technically ironic, but there is something interesting about the fact that this was the perfect use of Bitcoin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m not sure if it&amp;amp;#39;s exchanges, how governments have regulated those exchanges, or something else are that changed things, but this &amp;amp;quot;store of value&amp;amp;quot; thing is not what was intended for Bitcoin.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Maybe it&amp;amp;#39;s a social engineered manipulation by big actors on that sub.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They are missing the big picture:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Why would I ever give up my Bitcoin for printed-to-infinity government coupons (IOU&amp;amp;#39;s)?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Neo: what are you trying to tell me, that I can trade my bitcoins for millions someday?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://gyazo.com/10ead3a5c1fd8ed1e9d150ed6cced62d&quot;&amp;gt;Morpheus: No, Neo. I&amp;amp;#39;m trying to tell you that, when you are ready, you won&amp;amp;#39;t have to&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;When measured in fiat, Bitcoin price will rise infinitely&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Bitcoin has no top, because fiat has no bottom&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I will NEVER sell my Bitcoin for printed-to-infinity government IOU&amp;amp;#39;s, the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-kKDR30Fb8&quot;&amp;gt;same as somebody who bought a block in Manhattan on the 1800&amp;amp;#39;s&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; will never sell it no matter how high the price goes when measured in ever-worth-less USD.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You earn in value appreciation/equity against USD as well as in the expensive rents your tenants are paying. If you need even more fiat you borrow against it, and pass the prime real estate to your children and grand children... for many generations, and they don&amp;amp;#39;t ever sell it for fiat either.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I have had an account at this bank for about 15-16 years, my parents opened an account where I couldn&amp;amp;#39;t touch the money until I am 18 years old. I am 28 now so I have been personally using this account for exactly 10 years.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I have been sports betting for 20 and playing poker for 15 years now. First through my father and his debit cards until I turned 18, and ever since then I have used my personal account to transfer money into various poker and sports betting sites.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For TEN YEARS these motherfuckers did not say a word and are still not saying anything about me losing maybe 5 figures on poker and football bets but now all of a sudden they are worried that I might lose a few hundred bucks at a volatile market.

Major investors like VC and private equity funds, put their money into projects with a roughly five year time horizon (when they have to pay back their investors.)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Literally billions of dollars have flowed into the crypto markets in January, 2022 alone. Temporary price movements have little to no effect on these investor decisions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As the old sports saying goes, hockey players skate to where the puck will be, not where it is now.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Other trends point in the same direction.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;More and more banks are going to offer crypto trading services (watch out for those fees) according to industry stalwart American Banker (&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.americanbanker.com/list/7-tech-trends-to-watch-in-2022-from-crypto-banking-to-biometrics&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.americanbanker.com/list/7-tech-trends-to-watch-in-2022-from-crypto-banking-to-biometrics&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;). &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They do this because they project continued demand for these services, which requires them to spend money on infrastructure, marketing, It teams, to make it happen. As slow as banks generally move, the fact they are offering these services is a longer-term plus.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Still not enough positive momentum?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Consider which Blockchain/web 3.0/tokenization projects are actually making services better, faster, or cheaper (or will relatively soon.) The tech adoption curve starts out slow, but eventually sweeps upwards over time (no one knows how long it will take until there&amp;amp;#39;s mass adoption.)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crashes like this shake out weak projects, get-rich-quick traders (they&amp;amp;#39;ll be back when green days return, no doubt), and other fad chasers. That doesn&amp;amp;#39;t change the longer-term trajectory of the industry.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For the rest of you who have done their best to invest in more time proven projects like BTC/ETH its time to buckle up relax and wait for this all to blow over. Freaking out and panic selling to save a fraction of your investment wont help your future self. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Nobody knows anything. This might be a blip or a bear market. The best way to last in this space is to take a breather, zoom out, and realize eventually everything is gonna be alright. Success does not happen overnight.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;If you&amp;amp;#39;re freaking out now because you made some bad investments or over-extended yourself use this time as a learning opportunity.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I am not a crypto wizard. I made every mistake a newbie could make. Back in 2017-18 you could buy crypto with credit cards lol. But what I hope I&amp;amp;#39;m conveying is that if you hold onto your coins you&amp;amp;#39;ll most likely come out ahead eventually. In 2018 was so depressed and mad at myself I just uninstalled my apps and didnt look at my crypto until 2020. But then it got better and most of the projects I invested in back then started doing well again. If I had sold and not weathered the dip I would&amp;amp;#39;ve been even more angry at myself.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Remember to take time for yourself. Stop staring at reddit and charts all day. Please talk to someone if you&amp;amp;#39;re thinking about self-harm. It gets better yall. =)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the last 365 days Bitcoin is up 4.42% in that same span of time Amazon is down 15%&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But I know what you&amp;amp;#39;re all thinking 365 days is a long time. How can you possibly hodl an entire year?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/khkvtg7ypnd81.png?width=746&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=7122a5ef2330b0688c5619531d6b23c3c2f18660&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/khkvtg7ypnd81.png?width=746&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=7122a5ef2330b0688c5619531d6b23c3c2f18660&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Based on my extensive research it takes roughly 3-4 weeks to sail across the Atlantic ocean. If you have a boat and leave right away, you should be able to do 7 round trips.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now lets say you can&amp;amp;#39;t swim or you don&amp;amp;#39;t have a boat:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/ryt7yq3esnd81.png?width=746&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=7149169688ad7a3681611b88733003bcd670c15f&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/ryt7yq3esnd81.png?width=746&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=7149169688ad7a3681611b88733003bcd670c15f&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Since all you guys keep talking about going to the moon, just go!!!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In 365 days you could go back and forth to the moon almost 45 times&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;so if a Saturn V rocket cost $185 million X 45 trips that comes out to $8,325,000,000.00&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I was in profit with a couple of coins and I was telling myself that I should get a few hundreds there, few from other coin  and just keep it in fiat or stablecoin or whatever, just save it for a dip or crash, nothing more, nothing less.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Of course, I always invested using DCA tactics and I will keep doing that, but I thought I should have a certain amount of money for a really big dip or crash and don&amp;amp;#39;t touch it untill it happens.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyway, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;don&amp;amp;#39;t be like me&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, keep some money in case of a drop, crash. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I decided to try purchase my first NFT yesterday, and holy hell was that confusing. Still is. I used my MetaMask account had $200 worth of ETH on there, tried to bid on something worth .007 eth but noticed I had to change it? Okay did the steps ended up back with Poly??? Or some sort of “wrapped ETH”And now down to $70 due to gas fees.. worse yet I don’t even have the NFT. 
Just imagine going out to buy a $7 dollar beer only to be charged $130 then only to have the bar tender give it someone else. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I know there must have been steps I did not understand and may have screwed things up a little. But holy hell if we want this to be a thing of everyday use, this shit can’t be happening.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;EDIT- thank you everyone explaining things to me. Im not trying to shit on anything and I still have full belief in where we are heading. 
I understand now that we are still very early stages and I guess I’m just used to being late to parties. 
That and ETH is kind of a mess and there’s more than just OpenSea to purchase NFTs. Genuinely was unaware cardano has their own system for it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
