The only thing you need to do is &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;comment your Banano address&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; and you will receive some. In order for you to get yourself Banano, simply download the official wallet &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://kalium.banano.cc&quot;&amp;gt;Kalium&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; or use our &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://vault.banano.cc&quot;&amp;gt;web wallet&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. Setting up a wallet only takes a minute or so and wont cost you anything.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;What is Banano?&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Banano is an instant, fee-less and eco-friendly cryptocurrency founded in 2018 and probably inhabits the most friendly and funny community in all of crypto. In fact, this endorsement (or just call it a kind note) should tell you all you need to know:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/fgjskua97sl81.png?width=751&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=33b9485b4db1ca575c8382dffb44ec8bc1a867df&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/banano/comments/n9oz27/creator_of_dogecoin_here_was_told_to_check_this/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Importantly, Banano has been distributed entirely for free since April 1, 2018.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Banano has ongoing development since years and has experimented with hundreds of different ways of distribution since then, while keeping the onboarding of noobs and the education of users as a &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;priority&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. For example, we set up &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://bananominer.com/&quot;&amp;gt;Bananominer.com&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; which simply means we are rewarding users to contribute to Folding@Home with BAN - while Banano itself doesn’t require mining. This incentive to support medical research has led Banano into the top folding teams of all time! Stats can be found &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://stats.foldingathome.org/team&quot;&amp;gt;here&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
Want more free Banano? Try out these &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/banano/comments/nyb4ch/faucet_list/&quot;&amp;gt;faucets&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and join our community (&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/banano/&quot;&amp;gt;Reddit&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.banano.cc/&quot;&amp;gt;Discord&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; being the most active channels), we have loads of different ways to get free BANANO all the time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also, in recent times we started to wrap Banano and bring wBAN to Binance Smart Chain, Polygon and since yesterday also to the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://fantom.banano.cc&quot;&amp;gt;Fantom network&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To better understand what Banano is, check out our &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://banano.cc&quot;&amp;gt;website&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;particularly our&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://banano.cc/yellowpaper&quot;&amp;gt;meme-rich Yellowpaper&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. For help getting started and relevant links check out &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://banano.how&quot;&amp;gt;banano.how&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;THANK YOU to &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/CC&quot;&amp;gt;r/CC&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; for letting us do this, and we&amp;amp;#39;ll see YOU in the Jungle!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I can report that, I do not yet own a private island or a yacht, but it was really fun building it and didn&amp;amp;#39;t make my daytrading any worse lol. I have open sourced the extension so you can play around with it yourself. Maybe it&amp;amp;#39;ll make you into a literal trading GOD - maybe it&amp;amp;#39;ll bankrupt you, who knows.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you want to run the extension you would need to go to &amp;amp;quot;Manage Extension&amp;amp;quot; and click &amp;amp;quot;Load Unpacked&amp;amp;quot; and then select the root folder of the Repo. Feel free to inspect the source code first, and if you like the idea, you can submit a PR and help develop it further.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To enable it, make sure you&amp;amp;#39;re on a Spot, Margin or Futures page, open the extension and click &amp;amp;quot;Enable&amp;amp;quot; - done.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/qehpe7w3qrl81.jpg?width=778&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=2c1df1d2d8f23830adebe5923315a9cfba96f638&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/qehpe7w3qrl81.jpg?width=778&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=2c1df1d2d8f23830adebe5923315a9cfba96f638&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On Spot and Margin (naturally) you need to pre-own the coin in order to sell it. But on Futures (which are derivatives)  you can place the opposite order on a contract meaning you don&amp;amp;#39;t have to pre-own the assets in order go short. Def not saying you should trade futures but that&amp;amp;#39;s where this extension works best.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;If you&amp;amp;#39;re curious about how it works, how I&amp;amp;#39;ve built it and my own results after a week of testing:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/3QAJWENW-20&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;https://youtu.be/3QAJWENW-20&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

They have been selling BILLIONS of coins over the past few months, straight onto the market. The coin has gone from $5 to 1.3c as is still continuing to drop 50% every week, this is dangerous as it is listed on a few big exchanges.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You want proof?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://etherscan.io/token/0x7420B4b9a0110cdC71fB720908340C03F9Bc03EC#balances&quot;&amp;gt;https://etherscan.io/token/0x7420B4b9a0110cdC71fB720908340C03F9Bc03EC#balances&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Take a look at the top wallet holders. A single Binance wallet has almost 4billion coins, that is supposedly 80% of the 4.7b total supply? How does that happen? I’ll tell you how, the circulating supply of 4.7b is a total lie! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you add up the holding wallets, it easily passes 20billion in circulating supply!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Want more proof?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://etherscan.io/token/0x7420B4b9a0110cdC71fB720908340C03F9Bc03EC?a=0x318f51f82d2f0f4ed9c51f53b4666bd1e260b3e1&quot;&amp;gt;https://etherscan.io/token/0x7420B4b9a0110cdC71fB720908340C03F9Bc03EC?a=0x318f51f82d2f0f4ed9c51f53b4666bd1e260b3e1&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is the latest of many wallets that are just constantly dumping in batches of 500m tokens. I have been tracking these wallets and they continue to release coins in batches of 500m into the market, maybe to cover their tracks?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Every few days 500m coins are dumped in the market. There are about 25 of these 500m wallets, only about 12 have been released, so they will be releasing another 6.5 Billion coins in the coming months or even weeks!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Want further proof? Have a look at their latest announcements. They are always riddled with spelling and graphical errors. The kicker? They couldn’t even spell their own product name correctly. I am not making this up, look at it yourself! And when you look into the content of their announcements? It’s all meaningless fluff that chucks in a few buzz words here and there, an absolute joke!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They recently hosted an AMA. Normally an AMA would be someone from the team. Instead it was an absolutely random person with a fake identity hosting it, the person doesn’t even exist! It was cut off early due to “technical difficulties”. I am assuming they realised too many people caught on.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is an obvious scam that needs to be delisted! Make this known to protect innocent people from losing their hard earned money! This price has dropped 99.5% and the scam community still tells people to buy into it! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;DO NOT BUY THIS COIN!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit - this has been cross posted on the JASMY reddit and they are downvoting this post! Don’t let them hide the truth.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit - Take directly from the JASMY website and translated.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“Precautions regarding solicitation regarding cryptographic assets (virtual currency), etc. from the Company or a person who claims to be an affiliated company of the Company&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Recently, we have been inquired that there is a person who sells crypto assets (virtual currency) by deceiving our name.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Although it has already been reported in the media, the Consumer Affairs Agency, Financial Services Agency, and Police Agency are calling attention to the increase in troubles related to so-called &amp;amp;quot;cryptocurrencies (virtual currency)&amp;amp;quot; that are traded electronically via the Internet.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We or our affiliated companies do not sell crypto assets (virtual currency). In addition, we do not make inquiries to customers. The seller of crypto assets (virtual currency) that masquerades as our company has nothing to do with us. Please be careful not to pay the purchase price or other money of crypto assets (virtual currency).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In addition, the seminars and information dissemination by Jasmy&amp;amp;#39;s official supporters and groups / associations that claim to be the community, and the act of selling cryptographic assets (virtual currency) have nothing to do with our company.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Since February 2020, the only one that we have officially operated or authorized to operate is the developer support IoT service co-creation community &amp;amp;quot;Jasmy League&amp;amp;quot; posted on our website. We monitor the activities of the informal community that has been officially recognized by Jasmy in a timely manner, and take appropriate measures for the detected items in accordance with our information agency.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Seems like the Rug pull is in its final stages, now they are claiming that there is no Jasmy token. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I tried my best to warn everyone.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So your precious interest rates have been Nerfed by the Man? Aww, Welcome to capitalism. There’s supply and there’s demand, there’s inflation and evolving financial regulations. Manage your expectations. A word of advice: don’t bemoan your hardship to someone more familiar with traditional finance. You will get laughed at. You will be told to take a nap. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto.com isn’t here to nurse your emotions. companies fail when they are unable to make hard decisions and evolve with the growing demands of the economy. Your disgruntled proclamations and threats of departure will not help anything. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;More importantly, the clamoring malcontents have profoundly missed the actual value and opportunity that CDC provides. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Just weeks ago, the entire crypto community was wokecasting how important it is to move away from Centralized Exchanges because of sanctions and frozen assets, Canadian and Russian tyranny, blah blah… well here’s the opportunity, and it’s called Cronos.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;VVS, MM Finance, Tectonic and beefy finance— these are noteworthy names in the DeFi LP/yield farming sector. Cronos dapps are gaining quick traction and the entire ecosystem is only 5 months old. Your precious 12% on stablecoins is laughable compared to the opportunities and financial freedom this environment offers and yet everyone is too busy Karening off at CDC to notice or care.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I’m not surprised at all that this news has become the latest claim to victimhood, that’s the only way people around here know how to get attention, thinking they’re all savvy and righteous.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Can we please for once take a moment to appreciate how Cronos is a hell of a lot easier and usually cheaper to use than your average DEX? It’s time to get the ball rolling people, put your money where your mouth is. I’m not going anywhere, my faith in the future of CRO and CDC is as strong as ever, and I strongly urge you all to re-examine your options. There’s a great case for optimism here, you only have to want to see it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I was so hopeful initially; I bought her two years ago and have been staking, which is great, but to see her price almost at where I bought it is very disappointing. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Every day I feel like I see bullish news about ADA: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For example, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;The total amount of ADA coins on 1-10 million sized wallets reached a record high of 12.47 billion.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;The total value locked on the Cardano blockchain hit a new all-time high (ATH) on March 4th and as it closes on $140 million.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But yet, the price doesn&amp;amp;#39;t move at all. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I know we&amp;amp;#39;re in a bear market, and nothing is doing well now, but ADA makes me the saddest. Although it is pretty cool that they did reach their goal of planting 1 million trees, at least there&amp;amp;#39;s that. It has a long road to recover its losses to get back to its ATH. Remember when predictions were at $10 by the end of 2021, lol. Funny. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What&amp;amp;#39;s your most disappointing holding?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: I have been buying all the way up, so my avg price is $.80. My third largest holding at this point.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I’ve been a huge advocate of CDC, but this change is going to make consider jumping ship. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They’ve just announced that from April, you’ll only get the full advertised rates on up to $30k After that with the rate drop and a x0.5 reduction, the 12% I was enjoying on TGBP/USDC will be cut to 5%&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Can anyone recommend a rival or alternative for TGBP that’s available to UK users?  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The sneaky part was, they advertised the change like the rates were going up.  “New tiered rates structure and higher rewards for select tokens”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;//edit 1: on further reading, there’s a chart within the link and it’s worse than I thought.  All stable coin rates are dropping by 2%. Flexible earn is dropping from 8% to 4% so if you have 30k then anything else in flex is 2%&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;//edit 2: I’ll add the recommendations below this post, my research into them and my finding later.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the meantime, thanks to &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/u/ashtonlaszlo&quot;&amp;gt;/u/ashtonlaszlo&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; who has put together a Google doc &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vpBQI2DFUk7zXS4TCs9ZOnatvWHiYf5jHjKgKpfJG5Y/htmlview&quot;&amp;gt;comparison doc&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; that shows the rates for ~200 different coins. And, that you can get 12.68% and 12.73% on USDT/USDC at Vauld and Hodlnaut, respectively.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This was done also in 2018, but it lasted only two months the wage was unpegged and wage plumeted to around 2 USD monthly. Let&amp;amp;#39;s hope this time it stays and keeps going up!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Yes, you are reading it right, monthly minimum wage was 2 USD monthly and now it is around 28 USD!&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also there is a food bonus, paid in cash of 10 USD.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Wages are paid in Bolivares, 28 USD are around 126 Bs. (Bolivares) after goverment removed six zeros by law in Oct2021 (These 126 &amp;amp;quot;current&amp;amp;quot; Bolivares would have been 126,000,000 &amp;amp;quot;old&amp;amp;quot; Bs.)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If the peg is real amount in Bs. should change even if the exchange rate (USD / Bs) changes and PTR should stay around 60 USD.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Average monthly minimum wage is around 89 USD, this is different than 2018 that is why I believe this time it will last more. in 2018 average wage was so much closer to the minimum wage. I mean, people already is over 30 USD monthly. This will benefit mostly public workers and retirees and pensioners  (that have a bonus of the same amount than the monthly minimum wage by law).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;In average a 5 members family needs around 500 USD (this has been increasing lately) to &amp;amp;quot;live&amp;amp;quot; and 1,000 USD to live &amp;amp;quot;ok&amp;amp;quot;. This is according to CENDA (an NGO).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Remember average wage in South America is around 300 USD monthly.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;OCT2021 was the third time zeroes were removed from the currency. First was in 2008 where 3  zeroes were removed, then 5 zeroes in 2018 and now 6 zeroes in 2021.  1&amp;amp;quot;current&amp;amp;quot; Bs. would be 100,000,000,000,000 &amp;amp;quot;pre2008&amp;amp;quot; Bs. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Any question, I&amp;amp;#39;m happy to answer.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

This is forcing average everyday people to use crypto to buy food or whatever. Some are worried this leaves the door open for the gov, but the fact is their budget isn&amp;amp;#39;t in the hundreds, thousands, or even low millions. Their budget is so high in theory it wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t be that hard to figure out what wallets they are using through the ledger.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And since most crypto you can track every transaction through the ledger. In theory, what this means is if the companies/gov that map out the blockchain to figure out who is who. They can figure out who is the Russian gov sending money to, when, and all the other things around that. And from that look into the why and maybe start targeting groups Russia does business with.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For example, there is obviously direct connection between the Russian gov and the Russian Mafia. When you map the wallets out, you can see Russia gov paying the Russian Mafia and blast that info out to the wider world showing this corruption. And it would just take a small bit of investigation to find out why and exacts.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So in theory, this might be worth while for this to be a new norm to help track corruption or other problems.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is a lesson for people all around the world.  Firstly, don&amp;amp;#39;t start an unnecessary war. Secondly, If the government&amp;amp;#39;s around the world can bring down a countries economy in less than a week, imagine what can happen to you if the government&amp;amp;#39;s deems it so.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is why we need crypto. It can help you shield a part of your wealth when shit hits the fan. I believe these sanctions on Russia can create a broader awareness among people around the world to look more into crypto and cement belief in crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
