&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;1.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; The existence of exchanges has made Bitcoins core claims completely irrelevant.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;2.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; it is, at best, a toy. in reality it&amp;amp;#39;s a massive disaster. to people who were scammed. to the environment. to victims of ransomware. the list goes on and on. right now a million crypto bros are dreaming up ways to do even more harm. and most damning of all, this is for absolutely nothing. there is no problem that a blockchain can solve that isn&amp;amp;#39;t better solved by something else.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;3.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; You guys ask this shit every day, it gets so god damned old. You guys are so fucking obnoxious I can&amp;amp;#39;t stand you.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;4.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Simply put, crypto is nothing. It offers nothing. provides nothing. it is people speculating on the value of nothing being worth something but in the end it’s.nothing.  if you held a jar of a hobos dick cheese in your hand, you have something more intrinsically valuable than any amount of crypto. at least you have a jar which has its uses. For a bunch of people who think this is the mega game changer, they sure are spending a lot of time online, advertising money, and paid celebrities to try to convince us how amazing it is. Yet I don’t see the mass adoption 13 years later&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;5.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; What interest rate would you charge for a 30 year mortgage lent out in any non-stablecoin of your choice (because at best, stablecoins are only meant to mirror their pegged currency)? If you can&amp;amp;#39;t give me an interest rate that approaches rates used today, then your currency will never (and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;can&amp;amp;#39;t&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; ever) be adopted as a true currency. If you&amp;amp;#39;re just using it to gamble, then gamble away. Just don&amp;amp;#39;t make any allusions about a possible future of actual adoption.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;6.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; There would be no bitcoin in the madman future someone is preparing for. Unfortunately that&amp;amp;#39;s against and old argument for crypto. They keep changing their &amp;amp;#39;purpose&amp;amp;#39; usually it contradicts itself and there is a new &amp;amp;#39;purpose&amp;amp;#39; everyday.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;7.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Volatility makes it useless. If I gave you $100 in BTC and it tanks in a day, I did well and you did not. Or the opposite and it goes up. Someone always loses in the transaction. It’s up and down so much even a few percent in a matter of hours. Sure that’s not a big deal for $20-$50 but it is if we’re talking thousands. My “fiat” doesn’t change that much that quick.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;8.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Because it&amp;amp;#39;s a negative sum Ponzi/pyramid hybrid scheme that has absolutely no real world value.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;9.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; It’s just like fiat cash, only way less secure, far less convenient, and with unbelievable teller fees.It’s a solution in search of a problem.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;10.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; My top argument is Crypto is reinventing what we already have. Fractional reserve banking = stablecoin. Fast transactions (lightning) = Visa. Distributed ledger = database  Exchanges = banks. Carbon converted to CO2 en masse = mining.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Shortly you should see major exchanges rolling it out in the coming weeks.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Litecoin will have now has an optional privacy feature which will allow users to hide their address and crypto amounts when transferring (In addition to other features). This is a game changer for litecoin and a positive for those who like privacy in general, as it&amp;amp;#39;s optional privacy feature allows it to be exchange friendly.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Due to the fact litecoin is available on most exchanges, it will be highly accessible and easy to use it&amp;amp;#39;s privacy features.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In addition to the above, Litecoin will be one of the only coins to have smart contracts, nfts (omnilite upgrade) store of value (only 84 million to exist) brand recognition, has lasted 10 years survived multiple bear markets and to top it all off 100 percent uptime with low transaction fees. Not only that it is accepted everywhere bitcoin is accepted and has a growing not decreasing userbase.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is a historic day for litecoin and privacy advocates. The day MWEB activated.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I don&amp;amp;#39;t have any money in the bank I could spend on bitcoin, but I remembered I had around 2000 Dollars in an old Skrill account of mine, which is now 1000 Dollars because of fine&amp;amp;#39;s for inactivity. I have seen Bitcoin at a stable level after its massive drop so I though now would be the time to buy with knowledge from trading virtual money on the stock exchange.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Overall this is just a warning. I&amp;amp;#39;ve had it happen to me, and I&amp;amp;#39;m sure a lot of other people have as well.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Keep your crypto a secret unless people ask for it. Just go on with your life and do your thing and secretly keep earning that magic internet money we all love so much.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;January 1st, 2021, I bought $100 of following and turned it into a homemade crypto index fund: &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, XRP, Litecoin, Polkadot, Bitcoin Cash, Cardano, Binance Coin,&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Chainlink.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Below is the month 16update on the progress of the 2021 Experiment.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;tl;dr:&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;What&amp;amp;#39;s this all about?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Back in January 2018, I made a homemade crypto Index Fund, purchasing $100 of each of the Top 10. Crypto winter started immediately after, but I haven&amp;amp;#39;t sold or traded and have been reporting monthly ever since. I repeated the Experiment 2019, 2020, 2021, and again in 2022 because I&amp;amp;#39;m a glutton for punishment and to show different entry points.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments (including why in the world I would include Tether)&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;here&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;April highlights:  Every crypto in the 2021 Portfolio in the red, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BNB&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; continues to maintain a strong overall lead, 2021 Top Ten Portfolio is up +177% in sixteen months &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;2018+2019+2020+2021+2022 Combined Top Ten Portfolios are returning +219% compared to +29% in the S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 if invested as per the rules of the Experiments.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Month Sixteen – UP 177%&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/hpi6ygnsmf091.png?width=1050&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=339d8380b301edf7cd806be004d8e44a9e869959&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/hpi6ygnsmf091.png?width=1050&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=339d8380b301edf7cd806be004d8e44a9e869959&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The 2021 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund consists of: &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BTC, ETH, USDT, XRP, Litecoin, DOT, BCH, ADA, BNB,&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;LINK&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;April highlights for the 2021 Top Ten Portfolio: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Every crypto in the 2021 Portfolio in the red&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BNB&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; continues to maintain a strong overall lead&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;2021 Top Ten Portfolio is up +177% in sixteen months&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;April Ranking and Dropout Report&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/11mx1a4umf091.png?width=406&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e5447262a3c33a6fef7d6650cce55bd2e6760816&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/11mx1a4umf091.png?width=406&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e5447262a3c33a6fef7d6650cce55bd2e6760816&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Top Ten dropouts since January 2021:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;  sixteen months into the 2021 Top Ten Experiment, four cryptos have dropped out: &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Chainlink, Litecoin, Polkadot&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Bitcoin Cash.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;  They have been replaced by &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;SOL&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Luna, UST,&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;USDC&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;April Winners and Losers&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;April Winners&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; –  None, unless you count &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;USDT&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;April Losers&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; –   &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;LINK&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; lost more than a third of its value, down -35% in April. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;ADA&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; didn’t fare much better, dropping -32%, the second worst performer this month.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Overall Update – BNB far head, 70% of cryptos in green, Litecoin at the bottom&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As has largely been the case, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BNB&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; remains the crypto to beat in the 2021 Top Ten Portfolio. It is up +913%, the $100 investment into &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BNB&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; sixteen months ago is now worth &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$1,016.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Litecoin&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; is the worst performing of the 2021 Top Ten Portfolio cryptos at this point in the Experiment, down &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;-21%&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; since &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1/&quot;&amp;gt;January, 2021&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Total Market Cap for the Entire Cryptocurrency Sector:&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/tiz1xcpvmf091.png?width=582&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=152fbe4a1941572cd5d057a3edfc8cc26a1983c0&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/tiz1xcpvmf091.png?width=582&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=152fbe4a1941572cd5d057a3edfc8cc26a1983c0&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As a sector, crypto is up &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;+126%&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; since January 2021.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You may notice that the 2021 Top Ten Portfolio has produced better returns than the overall crypto market cap (+177% vs. +126%) over the sixteen month life of the 2021 Portfolio.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is a bit of an outlier and the gap is closing fast: the rest of the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/&quot;&amp;gt;Top Ten Experiments&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; are well behind over their respective market caps in their respective time frames.  Here are the latest figures:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Buying the Top Ten at equal weight in Jan 2018:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; down -1% vs. +205% for the total crypto market cap. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Starting in Jan 2019?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; +368% for the Top Ten vs. +1,277% for the total market cap. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Starting in Jan 2020?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; +574% for the Top Ten vs. +824% for the total Market Cap. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Starting in Jan 2022?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; -24% for the Top Ten vs. -21% total market cap.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Although the 2021 Top Ten approach has held up quite well compared to the overall market so far, I expect to see it fall behind eventually, like the other experiments.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2021:&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/jl66zeeymf091.png?width=384&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=589665b1a469939bbf9516f1d4d9f4749f518930&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/jl66zeeymf091.png?width=384&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=589665b1a469939bbf9516f1d4d9f4749f518930&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Overall, the 2021 Top Ten Portfolio is up +177%.  The initial $1000 investment sixteen months ago, on New Year’s Day, 2021, is worth &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$2,771&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here’s the month by month ROI of the 2021 Top Ten Experiment, to give you a sense of perspective as we go along:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/xusirvlzmf091.png?width=388&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=8f870beb562e6ddc1c5343fa55c8f54e0e255508&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/xusirvlzmf091.png?width=388&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=8f870beb562e6ddc1c5343fa55c8f54e0e255508&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As most readers are aware, this is the fifth year of an Experiment I started back in January of 2018, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/&quot;&amp;gt;at the height of the last crypto bull run&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.  Where do we stand if we combine five years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;2018 Top Ten Experiment: down -1% (total value $986)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;2019 Top Ten Experiment: up +368% (total value $4,684)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;2020 Top Ten Experiment: up +574% (total value $6,735) &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;(best performing portfolio)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-16&quot;&amp;gt;2021 Top Ten Experiment&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;: up +177% (total value $2,771)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-3&quot;&amp;gt;2022 Top Ten Experiment&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;: down -24% (total value $762)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So overall? Taking the five portfolios together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom bottom &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;bottom&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; line: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;After five annual $1k investments ($5,000 total) in the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; the combined portfolios are worth &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$15,938.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;That’s up +219%&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; on the combined portfolios. The peak  for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;November 2021’s all time high&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; of &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;+533%&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To visualize the progress of the combined portfolios:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/llqexme1nf091.png?width=600&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=d379350149aab679d3ddd298eb7c4ea2dcaa2619&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/llqexme1nf091.png?width=600&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=d379350149aab679d3ddd298eb7c4ea2dcaa2619&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In summary: &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;That’s a +219% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for five straight years&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Comparison to S&amp;amp;amp;P 500&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I’m also tracking the S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 as part of my experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/235ubup2nf091.png?width=538&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=0fb028e94735717ff08ccec5e364b634eac4114b&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/235ubup2nf091.png?width=538&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=0fb028e94735717ff08ccec5e364b634eac4114b&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 Index is up &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;+10%&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; since January 1st, 2021.  The initial $1k investment I put into crypto sixteen months ago would be worth &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$1,100&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; had it been redirected to the S&amp;amp;amp;P 500.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The 2021 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio is up &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;+177%&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; over the same time period – the initial $1k investment in crypto sixteen months ago is now worth &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$2,771.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That’s a difference of &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$1,671&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; on a $1k investment in sixteen months.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What about in the longer term? What if I invested in the S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 the same way I did during the first five years of the Top Top Crypto Index Fund Experiments? What I like to call the world’s slowest dollar cost averaging method?  Here are the figures:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;$1000 investment in S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1,550 today&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;$1000 investment in S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1,650 today&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;$1000 investment in S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,280 today&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;$1000 investment in S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,100 today&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;$1000 investment in S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $870 today&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Taken together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom bottom &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;bottom&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; line for a similar approach with the S&amp;amp;amp;P: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;After five $1,000 investments into an S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 my portfolio would be worth $6,450.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That is up &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;+29%&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/&quot;&amp;gt;since January 2018&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; compared to a &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;+219%&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To help provide perspective, here’s a chart showing the combined five year ROI for the Crypto Top Ten Experiment vs. the S&amp;amp;amp;P up to this point:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/8fclox34nf091.png?width=575&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=13fe1770d81ae69ce8755d27a5cf2b775829683b&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/8fclox34nf091.png?width=575&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=13fe1770d81ae69ce8755d27a5cf2b775829683b&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Conclusion:&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you so much for sticking around so long. For those just getting into crypto, I hope these reports will help prepare you for the highs and lows that await on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, go with the flow, think long term, don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose, and most importantly, try to enjoy the ride.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Feel free to reach out with any questions and stay tuned for progress reports.

And everyone in this space knows that USDT (Tether) has long been suspected of hiding its true reserves.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This morning, Tether &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://tether.to/en/assurance-opinion-once-again-re-affirms-tethers-reserves-fully-backed-reveals-significant-reductions-in-commercial-paper-and-increase-in-us-treasury-bills/&quot;&amp;gt;published a report&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; signed by an independent firm in which the reserves are estimated at just over 82 billion USD.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One thing I personally find interesting is that Tether seems to be moving away from commercial paper (illiquid debt instruments compared to other financial vehicles) and more towards the rock solid US treasury bills. They claim that commercial papers went down by 17% fro prior quarter. Tether also says that the ratings of the commercial papers they still hold has been upgraded from A-2 to A-1, which theoretically mean that they are less likely to default.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now, I would not take for granted all this information. Tether has shown some tendency to be somewhat secretive in the past. But given the recent events, I think it&amp;amp;#39;s a good thing that they try to be more transparent - and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;if the assesment is truthful, then the biggest stablecoin in our ecosystem is safe&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, and we don&amp;amp;#39;t have to worry about another depeg disaster.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What do you think about Tether reserve? I personally prefer USDC/DAI, but I&amp;amp;#39;m curious about where this sub stands about USDT now.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto prices, as every other financial asset prices, are completly dependent on the state of the human psychology and that&amp;amp;#39;s dependent on how the world is doing.

Also Don&amp;amp;#39;t forget that Covid is still here.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

So, there should be a professional explanation about their reserves? Nope.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The entire article is pretty much useless:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Given the recent losses UST investors suffered, many users may be questioning if they can trust Tether USD₮ given the spectacular collapse of UST.   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thankfully, all one needs to do is look at the history and track record of Tether USD₮.   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Tether USD₮ has been relied on as the primary form of dollar-based liquidity in the crypto market for many years and the crypto market has not been without its share of dramatic crashes! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Like, what is this? They are saying they should be trusted entirely based on their track record, with no other explanation whatsoever??&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The first half of the page is useless, so what about the second half? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The second half of the article is titled &amp;amp;quot;How Does an Algorithmic Stablecoin Work?&amp;amp;quot; and it&amp;amp;#39;s ALL they are talking about. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While UST is referred to as a stablecoin, it has nothing in common with collateralized stablecoins like Tether USD₮. UST is an algorithmic stablecoin. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Again, they are using UST as a scapegoat instead of addressing their reserves or any explanation of how they maintain their peg. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://tether.to/en/how-tether-usdt-is-able-to-maintain-its-peg-when-other-stablecoins-fall/?fbclid=IwAR38zybf2sEcEoRfH2avk8IxmZUe6R77AGpceIykVihyMK7GIHnx4ON9VP8&quot;&amp;gt;Source&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Some have gone so far to call tether a cancer that must die for crypto to ascend to some magical new ath. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Personally, I acknowledge that they aren’t a model coin and do have suspicious backing/audit history, but I’m not rooting for their outright implosion. I seriously think people underestimate the ripple effects throughout crypto that would happen if USDT went bust. Something like 60-70% of all BTC volume is done through USDT and it’s a massive part of crypto volume in general. It this goes up in smoke, then exchanges can go under and volume would dry up considerably. This would lead to massive price drops and liquidity crises that would give governments free reign to completely shape crypto with whatever regulations they see fit. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I’d prefer for USDT to slowly be replaced by USDC/DAI/etc and be less influential rather than the above scenario. Why do so many people think that USDT going bust would only cause short term pain?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Disclaimer: been around since 2017 and yes, I know about Mt. Gox. Something like this would be worse Imo.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
