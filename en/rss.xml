&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I was so hopeful initially; I bought her two years ago and have been staking, which is great, but to see her price almost at where I bought it is very disappointing. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Every day I feel like I see bullish news about ADA: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For example, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;The total amount of ADA coins on 1-10 million sized wallets reached a record high of 12.47 billion.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;The total value locked on the Cardano blockchain hit a new all-time high (ATH) on March 4th and as it closes on $140 million.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But yet, the price doesn&amp;amp;#39;t move at all. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I know we&amp;amp;#39;re in a bear market, and nothing is doing well now, but ADA makes me the saddest. Although it is pretty cool that they did reach their goal of planting 1 million trees, at least there&amp;amp;#39;s that. It has a long road to recover its losses to get back to its ATH. Remember when predictions were at $10 by the end of 2021, lol. Funny. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What&amp;amp;#39;s your most disappointing holding?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: I have been buying all the way up, so my avg price is $.80. My third largest holding at this point.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I’ve been a huge advocate of CDC, but this change is going to make consider jumping ship. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They’ve just announced that from April, you’ll only get the full advertised rates on up to $30k After that with the rate drop and a x0.5 reduction, the 12% I was enjoying on TGBP/USDC will be cut to 5%&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Can anyone recommend a rival or alternative for TGBP that’s available to UK users?  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The sneaky part was, they advertised the change like the rates were going up.  “New tiered rates structure and higher rewards for select tokens”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;//edit 1: on further reading, there’s a chart within the link and it’s worse than I thought.  All stable coin rates are dropping by 2%. Flexible earn is dropping from 8% to 4% so if you have 30k then anything else in flex is 2%&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;//edit 2: I’ll add the recommendations below this post, my research into them and my finding later.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the meantime, thanks to &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/u/ashtonlaszlo&quot;&amp;gt;/u/ashtonlaszlo&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; who has put together a Google doc &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vpBQI2DFUk7zXS4TCs9ZOnatvWHiYf5jHjKgKpfJG5Y/htmlview&quot;&amp;gt;comparison doc&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; that shows the rates for ~200 different coins. And, that you can get 12.68% and 12.73% on USDT/USDC at Vauld and Hodlnaut, respectively.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This was done also in 2018, but it lasted only two months the wage was unpegged and wage plumeted to around 2 USD monthly. Let&amp;amp;#39;s hope this time it stays and keeps going up!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Yes, you are reading it right, monthly minimum wage was 2 USD monthly and now it is around 28 USD!&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also there is a food bonus, paid in cash of 10 USD.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Wages are paid in Bolivares, 28 USD are around 126 Bs. (Bolivares) after goverment removed six zeros by law in Oct2021 (These 126 &amp;amp;quot;current&amp;amp;quot; Bolivares would have been 126,000,000 &amp;amp;quot;old&amp;amp;quot; Bs.)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If the peg is real amount in Bs. should change even if the exchange rate (USD / Bs) changes and PTR should stay around 60 USD.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Average monthly minimum wage is around 89 USD, this is different than 2018 that is why I believe this time it will last more. in 2018 average wage was so much closer to the minimum wage. I mean, people already is over 30 USD monthly. This will benefit mostly public workers and retirees and pensioners  (that have a bonus of the same amount than the monthly minimum wage by law).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;In average a 5 members family needs around 500 USD (this has been increasing lately) to &amp;amp;quot;live&amp;amp;quot; and 1,000 USD to live &amp;amp;quot;ok&amp;amp;quot;. This is according to CENDA (an NGO).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Remember average wage in South America is around 300 USD monthly.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;OCT2021 was the third time zeroes were removed from the currency. First was in 2008 where 3  zeroes were removed, then 5 zeroes in 2018 and now 6 zeroes in 2021.  1&amp;amp;quot;current&amp;amp;quot; Bs. would be 100,000,000,000,000 &amp;amp;quot;pre2008&amp;amp;quot; Bs. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Any question, I&amp;amp;#39;m happy to answer.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

This is forcing average everyday people to use crypto to buy food or whatever. Some are worried this leaves the door open for the gov, but the fact is their budget isn&amp;amp;#39;t in the hundreds, thousands, or even low millions. Their budget is so high in theory it wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t be that hard to figure out what wallets they are using through the ledger.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And since most crypto you can track every transaction through the ledger. In theory, what this means is if the companies/gov that map out the blockchain to figure out who is who. They can figure out who is the Russian gov sending money to, when, and all the other things around that. And from that look into the why and maybe start targeting groups Russia does business with.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For example, there is obviously direct connection between the Russian gov and the Russian Mafia. When you map the wallets out, you can see Russia gov paying the Russian Mafia and blast that info out to the wider world showing this corruption. And it would just take a small bit of investigation to find out why and exacts.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So in theory, this might be worth while for this to be a new norm to help track corruption or other problems.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

We’ve been blocked out of Binance for 2 years and no one’s said shit, I doubt any of you even knew that we had to pack our shit up and leave, the Russians haven’t even been blocked yet and I’ve seen you people become united as if it were your own accounts.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“We must stand up for all users”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Are we not innocent? Is it the colour of our skins? What is it? Why are y’all more worried about the &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;idea&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; of it happening to Russians but we’ve been kicked out for years and no one batted an eye?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fair enough, I can use other exchanges like KuCoin. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This isn’t even a geographical issue, I’m in Dubai and binance is supported here, but everytime I try to verify my account I get blocked because my Dubai residency card shows where I’m from.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To the Russians, I’m not mad at you guys, you really shouldn’t be thrown off of exchanges because of your government. I guess I’m just pissy because people fight for you and leave us out in the sun. 🤷🏻‍♂️ &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fuck the Government. Sanctions don’t affect the government, it affects ordinary, innocent people.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So I cannot stress enough that updates are very dangerous and the Bitcoin community was wise enough to avoid hard forks at all costs.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitcoins from 10 years ago can still move using the original protocol.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Saylor went on to say that coins like coin #2 whose monetary policy change every 6 months cannot be considered property and are thus securities. And with that drop mic moment shut the mouths of the interviewers about his opinion on it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

As the industry matures, people will have more reasons to visit different ecosystems, driving more value into cross-chain applications.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In order to access your source blockchain in new ecosystems, you need a reliable way to verify its “state” (a snapshot of account balances and transactions) in the new environment. This trustless infrastructure is currently missing from the market, so people have turned to trusted intermediaries, like centralized bridges and validator networks, to handle their assets. Layer-1 blockchains share a responsibility to reduce this trust threshold in order to protect on-chain value.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Algorand State Proofs (ASPs) are a new interoperability standard that extends trustless interactions beyond a blockchain’s native ecosystem. Through &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/codechain/blockchain-light-client-1171dfa1269a&quot;&amp;gt;light clients&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; (efficient software that tracks blockchain state), they provide a simple, trustless interface to build powerful applications conditioned by multiple blockchains’ events. State Proofs can be implemented on all Proof of Stake chains, and will accelerate our collective path towards true decentralization.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Algorand State Proofs fortify cross-chain applications with Post-Quantum security. By using advanced cryptography, ASPs can withstand attacks by powerful quantum computers that try to alter the reported state of the blockchain, providing a robust, portable source of truth about on-chain data.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;From trustless bridges that move assets across blockchains to decentralized oracles that export valuable on-chain data, people will be able to leverage Algorand’s fast, cheap, and reliable protocol in new ecosystems without trust in an intermediary–they only need to trust the security of the underlying blockchain itself.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Interoperability Problem&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;2021 was an exciting year for the blockchain industry, with a 1,200% growth¹ in the Total Value Locked (TVL) in global DeFi smart contracts, the rise of NFTs, and a diversification across many Layer-1 chains. The promise of a thriving, decentralized blockchain ecosystem is nearly here — yet, most dApps are constrained by the very platform they are built upon.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Blockchain communities are looking for reliable ways to use their favorite dApps without paying expensive gas fees, dealing with network outages, or trusting intermediaries with their valued assets.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Developers want to build on fast and inexpensive blockchains like Algorand, and want immediate access to an expanded user base and liquidity scattered across several ecosystems.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Investors seek exciting opportunities on multiple platforms without switching chains or turning to more centralized alternatives.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;People want to send basic transactions across blockchains in a trustless manner.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Developers, creators, and investors are looking for interoperability solutions that break them out of their walled gardens. ASPs remove these boundaries and open the doors to cross-chain applications and liquidity.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Bridging Solution&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To solve these interoperability problems, many companies have built bridges that move assets across blockchains. These “bridged” assets can be freely used in the target chain’s ecosystem: lent out as collateral for a loan, traded for another asset, or simply held in a wallet.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While bridges show promise, most solutions require people to trust the bridge operator or a set of delegates to store and move their assets in a secure, timely manner. With over $32 billion worth of assets already held in cross-chain bridges (up from $670 million at the start of 2021)², the industry has created a new, centralized attack surface with a large target.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We have an opportunity to eliminate trust from the interoperability equation, creating a new breed of trustless bridges and cross-chain applications that don’t compromise on cost, reliability, or security.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Algorand State Proofs&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Introducing Algorand State Proofs: new blockchain infrastructure that connects Algorand to the broader world. ASPs are an &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://people.csail.mit.edu/nickolai/papers/micali-compactcert-eprint.pdf&quot;&amp;gt;immutable chain of proofs&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; that attest to the state of the Algorand blockchain. They let anyone track Algorand transactions, balances, and application data in low-power environments like a phone, smartwatch, and even inside a blockchain smart contract, without compromising on security — each ASP is produced by the same decentralized network that reaches &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.algorand.com/technology/pure-proof-of-stake&quot;&amp;gt;consensus&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; on new blocks.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Due to their lightweight, portable nature, ASPs can be used to update Algorand light clients in other ecosystems. To lower costs in fee-constrained environments like Ethereum, Algorand will also produce even more compact zk-SNARK proofs that can be used to keep light clients up to date.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Applications like bridges, oracles, and wallets can query these light clients to cryptographically verify Algorand state in a simple, trustless manner. For example, say Alice wants to send Bob 10 AliceCoins from Algorand to Ethereum. AliceCoins are extremely valuable, so they want to make sure the tokens arrive quickly, safely, and without permission from or trust in an intermediary. Alice can send these tokens directly to Bob’s Ethereum wallet via a trustless bridge whose code-base is open to the public.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/99totm7qa7l81.png?width=1400&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=00cdb402e5b39e1072c564816ad169fa54b9e575&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/99totm7qa7l81.png?width=1400&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=00cdb402e5b39e1072c564816ad169fa54b9e575&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Behind the scenes, Alice would “lock” the tokens in the trustless bridge’s &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.algorand.com/smart-contracts-defi&quot;&amp;gt;Algorand smart contract&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, which prevents her from creating duplicate tokens out of thin air. The bridge’s Ethereum smart contract would simply ask the Algorand light client (kept up-to-date by State Proofs) if Alice did, in fact, lock the tokens. Once verified, the bridge would mint and release an equivalent amount on Ethereum to Bob’s chosen wallet.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Similarly, the bridge can trustlessly mint and release bridged Ethereum assets into the Algorand ecosystem using Ethereum light clients. Bridge operators can create Algorand smart contracts that ask these light clients to validate Ethereum transactions (e.g. depositing ETH in an Ethereum smart contract) via Algorand’s &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/algorand/hello-contract-calling-abff8fc00939&quot;&amp;gt;Contract to Contract calls&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. These light client pairs complete the import/export flow for bi-directional bridging.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;The Big Picture&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Algorand State Proofs fortify cross-chain applications with Post-Quantum security. By using advanced cryptography, ASPs can withstand attacks by powerful quantum computers that try to alter the reported state of the blockchain, providing a robust, portable source of truth about on-chain data.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;From trustless bridges that move assets across blockchains to decentralized oracles that export valuable on-chain data, people will be able to leverage Algorand’s fast, cheap, and reliable protocol in new ecosystems without trust in an intermediary–they only need to trust the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.algorand.com/technology/security&quot;&amp;gt;security&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; of the underlying blockchain itself.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Roadmap&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Algorand State Proofs will be available soon, with our first milestone going live this month (March 2022). After next week’s consensus upgrade, the Algorand network will start registering the Post-Quantum secure voting keys used to generate ASPs.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As governments worldwide are placing sanctions on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren is worried that cryptocurrency could give Russia a way to evade sanctions. The senator from Massachusetts tweeted Monday:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Cryptocurrencies risk undermining sanctions against Russia, allowing Putin and his cronies to evade economic pain.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“U.S. financial regulators need to take this threat seriously and increase their scrutiny of digital assets,” she added.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then on wednesday she and three other senators write a letter to Janet Yellen of all people telling her to &amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.warren.senate.gov/oversight/letters/senators-warren-warner-brown-reed-express-concerns-to-treasury-regarding-potential-use-of-cryptocurrency-to-evade-sanctions&quot;&amp;gt;enforce sanctions compliance&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot; in the crypto industry &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All of this out of a supposed fear that Putin is going to use crypto to bypass sanctions even though its been known for a while now that Russia has been sanction-proofing itself by building up gold and Chinese Yuan reserves. As well as crypto&amp;amp;#39;s marketcap and volatility making it an unsuitable medium for country-scale transactions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;See why &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://mobile.twitter.com/jchervinsky/status/1498786025438650369&quot;&amp;gt;Russia wont be using crypto to bypass sanctions&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Tired of these politicians pushing their own agendas.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;During last weeks (especially since the Ukraine-Russian war got into the mainstream) I’m seeing more and more comments of people mixing crypto and politics, and I don’t think this benefits the crypto space nor is it necessary.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto has nothing to do with politics, I understand that personalities like Vitalik, CEO’s of exchanges or other famous crypto personalities talk about politics, they have all the right to do so. But we shouldn’t make the mistake to mix crypto with politics.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
