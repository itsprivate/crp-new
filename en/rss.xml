&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Key findings&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Blockchain immutability can be broken not by exploiting cryptographic vulnerabilities, but instead by subverting the properties of a blockchain’s implementations, networking, and consensus protocols. We show that a subset of participants can garner undue, centralized control over the entire system:

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;While the encryption used within cryptocurrencies is for all intents and purposes secure, it does not &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;guarantee&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; security, as touted by proponents.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Bitcoin traffic is unencrypted; any third party on the network route between nodes (e.g., internet service providers, Wi-Fi access point operators, or governments) can observe and choose to drop any messages they wish.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Tor is now the largest network provider in Bitcoin; just about 55% of Bitcoin nodes were addressable &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;only&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; via Tor (as of March 2022). A malicious Tor exit node can modify or drop traffic.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;More than one in five Bitcoin nodes are running an old version of the Bitcoin core client that is known to be vulnerable.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The standard protocol for coordination within blockchain mining pools, Stratum, is unencrypted and, effectively, unauthenticated.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The number of entities sufficient to disrupt a blockchain is relatively low: four for Bitcoin, two for Ethereum, and less than a dozen for most proof-of-stake networks.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;When nodes have an out-of-date or incorrect view of the network, this lowers the percentage of the hashrate necessary to execute a standard 51% attack. During the first half of 2021, the actual cost of a 51% attack on Bitcoin was closer to 49% of the hashrate—and this can be lowered substantially through network delays.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;For a blockchain to be optimally distributed, there must be a so-called Sybil cost. There is currently no known way to implement Sybil costs in a permissionless blockchain like Bitcoin or Ethereum without employing a centralized trusted third party (TTP). Until a mechanism for enforcing Sybil costs without a TTP is discovered, it will be almost impossible for permissionless blockchains to achieve satisfactory decentralization.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Of all Bitcoin traffic, 60% traverses just three ISPs.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The Ethereum ecosystem has a significant amount of code reuse: 90% of recently deployed Ethereum smart contracts are at least 56% similar to each other.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Conclusion&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In this report, Trail of Bits has identified several scenarios in which blockchain immutability is called into question not by exploiting cryptographic vulnerabilities but instead by subverting the properties of a blockchain’s implementation, networking, or consensus protocol. A subset of a blockchain’s participants can garner excessive, centralized control over the entire system. The majority of Bitcoin nodes have significant incentives to behave dishonestly, and in fact, there is no known way to create any permissionless blockchain that is impervious to malicious nodes without having a TTP&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This New and exciting project offers the fastest transaction speeds with safety in mind.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;CEO of Harmony:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We have learned from our mistakes, and are now fully committed to making Harmony Two work, in truth we always saw Harmony one as a Beta test for what the real Harmony Blockchain could be.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Read some of the questions asked to the CEO During the Press Conference below&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Why should people trust harmony Two?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Like any project we like to move fast and break things, we believe that all the things that needed to be broken have been found and are now confident that Harmony Two is a safe investment.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;If this is a new project, why keep the same name?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Well that&amp;amp;#39;s a trick question because the name used to be one but now its two which is a completely different number, we are getting better as time goes on.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Do you think that it would make investors feel better if you added SAFE to the name?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This was something that was discussed at length with the board and ultimately it was decided that our investors are to smart for something like that. They would see right through us adding the word safe just to trick them, we felt that going with Harmony Two also sounded better that Harmony Safe. We also saw the great success that LUNA 2.0 got so figured Two was the way to go.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Well it does seem like you have everything figured out, how will Harmony one investors get compensated for their loses?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We will be allowing Harmony One holders to swap their ONE for TWO, for every ten ONE they will receive one TWO. This will be great for investors as we see Harmony Two becoming more valuable than ONE ever was.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;How will the compensation be sent out?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Well obviously the easiest thing is to get the whales out of the way first and then concentrate on smaller holders so we can allow ourselves more time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thank you for your time fellow bag holders.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But the aftermath is surreal. Let me explain. The tokens that were locked on Ethereum side are supposedly to peg for existence of tokens on Harmony chain. So, all the tokens on Ethereum side (Horizon bridge) were stolen, which means the tokens minted on Harmony chain were basically worthless as there are nothing to back for their existence.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So what are you gonna do with those &amp;amp;#39;worthless&amp;amp;#39; tokens (1WBTC, 1ETH, 1USDC)? You gotta swap for other tokens to take advantage of their price in the liquidity pools, which has not been updated. This explain certain pumps of JEWEL, TRANQ, FIRA, ROY.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then, you wait for people who don&amp;amp;#39;t know what happen and FOMO in. Finally, whales exit for ONE to dump on centralised exchanges and people who put money in eventually turn to be exit liquidity.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We&amp;amp;#39;re in bear market now, and I don&amp;amp;#39;t think there&amp;amp;#39;s gonna be any VC to bail out Harmony for tokens lost on Horizon bridge.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Harmony One is probably Harmony Done now!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Not trying to cause any further distress. But I urge anyone who holds their ONE, please don&amp;amp;#39;t listen to anyone telling you to buy the dip, including ONE and tokens on its chain. You&amp;amp;#39;re gonna be their exit liquidity.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit #1: So someone said I am FUDDING. Heck no. And their argument is that price of ONE has not been down much. It&amp;amp;#39;s clearly shown you have no idea of what is going on now. Look at the price of those tokens I show. They dumped their bags for ONE, because ONE is the only token they could cash out on CEX for real stablecoins like USDT. So that&amp;amp;#39;s why ONE has not gone down much. But be prepared for a dump of ONE on CEX.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Harmony One just got hacked for over 100m as their cross chain bridge was almost entirely drained, leaving anyone holding the wrapped version of their tokens 1ETH, 1USDC etc completely up shit creek. Harmony have disabled the bridge for the time being and prices of various assets on Harmony have completely shit the bed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In a post over 6 months ago Vitalik outlined the dangers of cross chain bridges:&amp;amp;#39;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/rwojtk/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_7_07_january/hrngyk8/&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/rwojtk/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_7_07_january/hrngyk8/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now, imaging what happens if you move  100 ETH onto a bridge on Solana to get 100 Solana-WETH, and then  Ethereum gets 51% attacked. The attacker deposited a bunch of their own  ETH into Solana-WETH and then reverted that transaction on the Ethereum  side as soon as the Solana side confirmed it. The Solana-WETH contract  is now no longer fully backed, and perhaps your 100 Solana-WETH is now  only worth 60 ETH. Even if there&amp;amp;#39;s a perfect ZK-SNARK-based bridge that  fully validates consensus, it&amp;amp;#39;s still vulnerable to theft through 51%  attacks like this.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;For  this reason, it&amp;amp;#39;s always safer to hold Ethereum-native assets on  Ethereum or Solana-native assets on Solana than it is to hold  Ethereum-native assets on Solana or Solana-native assets on Ethereum&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is just an excerpt from the post but the whole thing is really worth a read. It explains the inherent risk and dangers involved in cross-chain bridges. Now more than ever I think it&amp;amp;#39;s important to remind people that tokenized &amp;amp;quot;wrapped&amp;amp;quot; assets on other chains are *not* the same as having the token on the native chain.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Since when is a double spend, with proof of concept, solely informational? It was so outrageous I reached out to Immunefi, the arbitrators, because surely this in violation of not only their posted bug bounty, yet easily shown to be Chain lying in an attempt to keep their funds.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;We believe that there is no impact as the development and support for &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chain/chain/&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;https://github.com/chain/chain/&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;  has ended and it is now archived and therefore no users are at risk.  Project agreed that it was wrong of them to include this repository in  in-scope section, so we think that the payout offered by the project is  fair.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Immunefi acknowledged the repo was in-scope, didn&amp;amp;#39;t contest this was a critical vulnerability on the repo, yet &amp;amp;#39;company made a mistake and apologized so now you don&amp;amp;#39;t get paid&amp;amp;#39;. Also, it wasn&amp;amp;#39;t archived. There was no notice on the GH repository, nor in the README, which I did point out.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Immunefi came back with a &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chain/chain/commit/6f8f079ab44194ccacfe45d2e847c9e4c5808e02&quot;&amp;gt;commit&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; adding an archival notice from a few years ago (a commit which I&amp;amp;#39;d assume was provided by Chain). Funnily enough, they didn&amp;amp;#39;t also come back with the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chain/chain/commit/82682a361a4fa3200df76abd7198d69359337ffd&quot;&amp;gt;commit deleting the archival notice&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; from last year. While Chain has since archived the repository, and removed the last traces of Chain Core from their site (as I pointed those out to Immunefi) &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20220531183905/https://github.com/chain/chain/&quot;&amp;gt;the Wayback Machine doesn&amp;amp;#39;t lie&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, and I have &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20220223101920/https://chain.com/core/&quot;&amp;gt;all of it saved&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With their response though, they did say the following:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;It was listed as in scope on Immunefi, with &amp;amp;quot;Blockchain/DLT&amp;amp;quot; explicitly marked as having a critical bug bounty&amp;amp;quot;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;this is correct, both Immunefi and the project never said otherwise.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How can Immunefi fully acknowledge it&amp;amp;#39;s in scope, with a critical bug bounty, have no one be contesting the bug&amp;amp;#39;s existence, and say it&amp;amp;#39;s not eligible for a critical bug bounty? On what planet does any of this make sense?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After responding yet again, they then didn&amp;amp;#39;t respond for weeks, despite following up, until I said I planned to publicly disclose this (as allowed), at which point they finally said said disclosure would cause them to void the offer for 10k.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Well. Here&amp;amp;#39;s my disclosure. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;If you use Chain Core, there&amp;amp;#39;s a trivial double spend possible, allowing exponentially minting funds. They don&amp;amp;#39;t properly check you can&amp;amp;#39;t spend the same coins multiple times in a single transaction.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Chain has claimed they have such no clients, yet if you, or your company, does use this (notably with an active B2B contract with Chain), PLEASE SPEAK UP. I&amp;amp;#39;d also like to disclose Chain is a company which lies in their bug bounty process, and disclose Immunefi won&amp;amp;#39;t hesitate to side with corporations, even while they actively acknowledge the corporation is at fault, to deprive legitimate disclosures their advertised payouts. I no longer believe Immunefi can be effective arbitrators and will not recommend them in the future.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As one final question, what even is $XCN? It&amp;amp;#39;s #34, with a blog post from months ago saying it partnered with Alameda to be their &amp;amp;quot;market maker&amp;amp;quot;. It&amp;amp;#39;s a basic token with what appears to be an unattributed fork of MasterChef from Sushiswap, along with some basic governance contract? Is it just the latest VC PnD using a company from 7 years ago to give it notoriety?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I’m pretty sure everyone here knows Tether isn’t fully backed and it’s a matter of time before the house of cards falls.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This isn’t fud, just trying to help some people out there.  No need to sell your BTC, ETH or any other projects you believe in.  But be very cautious with yields and stable coins.  Ideally it’s best to hold your own coins in cold storage.  Keep stacking&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The realized losses, meaning actual losses after people sell, have reached about $22.67 billion and is likely even over $23 billion as we are speaking.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Is this a bottom signal? No, definitely not but this just shows how brutal this crash has been so far you can very well argue that this has been worse than 2018 and makes the 2021 may correction look like literally nothing. And in this environment it is definitely remarkable how many are still here.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We may get to $40b realized losses or more. But all that matters is that you don&amp;amp;#39;t get caught by paper hands and sell yourself. Of course we very likely won&amp;amp;#39;t hit a new ATH this year. But as Crypto has shows in the past that patience is key.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Until I actually looked at the data.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While there was indisputably some positive effect of having extra cash on the market, numbers showed that the effect wasn&amp;amp;#39;t as big as you would expect. Nor was it even what triggered the bull market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Why wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t over $5 Trillion of extra cash not have a profound impact on Bitcoin and the crypto market?&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Keep in mind, the full $5 Trillion didn&amp;amp;#39;t go into stimulus checks, much less into crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Only $1.8T went to individuals.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The rest went to healthcare, local government, airline industry, businesses, etc...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Something that would maybe still help stocks more, but not so much crypto  (at the time, the correlation to stocks still wasn&amp;amp;#39;t strong, around 0.4-0.5).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Even the $1.8T didn&amp;amp;#39;t all go to stimulus checks. A big part went to Child tax credits, SNAP, unemployment, retirement.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/11/us/how-covid-stimulus-money-was-spent.html&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/11/us/how-covid-stimulus-money-was-spent.html&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;$817B went to stimulus checks.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;What percentage of the stimulus checks actually went into crypto?&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;According to Mizuho research, about 10% of stimulus recipient planned on investing their check in stocks or crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yahoo.com/video/nearly-10-of-the-380-billion-in-stimulus-checks-may-be-used-to-buy-bitcoin-and-stocks-survey-131009531.html&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.yahoo.com/video/nearly-10-of-the-380-billion-in-stimulus-checks-may-be-used-to-buy-bitcoin-and-stocks-survey-131009531.html&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Mizuho has estimated that the amount used from stimulus check would only have added about a 2-3% to the market value of Bitcoin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;What was happening to Bitcoin before Covid, and did Covid and Fed printing trigger the bull run?&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One of the first problems I ran into with this theory, is Bitcoin was already at the beginning of a bull market, and had already made its turning point, before any of the stimulus checks, or before Covid became a big world issue.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/aazxmafqge791.jpg?width=1788&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=111c221e82f6d7859d354c3d58de342b33dd7a97&quot;&amp;gt;Turning point for Bitcoin, beginning of bull market, and Covid interruption&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Stimulus checks didn&amp;amp;#39;t trigger the bull market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The bearish and selling pressure had already been exhausted, already reverted to bullish and buying pressure, already had a breakout, and already had its first parabolic run to $13K. Which had already corrected, and the resuming bull trend got interrupted with the Covid crash.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;The actual timeline of the stimulus checks versus the price of Bitcoin.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the following chart are the zones where the stimulus started to hit people&amp;amp;#39;s accounts.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Direct deposits are yellow, mailed checks are orange.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s in &amp;amp;quot;zones&amp;amp;quot; because not everyone got their checks instantly or at the same time. There were also waves, delays, etc...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Keep in mind, there would likely be additional time between the time those funds are received, and the time they can actually be traded on an exchange, especially if they have to open their first account.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/76eb4hjbhe791.jpg?width=1890&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=2c390383b9f16cebe85c8dcecdb697c75e971463&quot;&amp;gt;Second stimulus check distribution&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/dvfy5w79he791.jpg?width=1890&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e89c99f58dc4a41551e987b9e33d0fbd9f8f0342&quot;&amp;gt;Third stimulus check distribution&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All 3 distributions are followed by a downtrend.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The difference is in the 3rd distribution, there is crabbing throughout most of the distribution, followed by a crash.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Research has found that the stimulus checks may have only affected Bitcoin trading by an estimated 3.8%&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;According to the research done about stimulus checks, by the Federal Reserve Bank, only 0.02% of all the Cares Act fund distributed went into Bitcoin, with only an estimated 3.8% increase in trading resulting from the stimulus money.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/newsroom-and-events/publications/working-papers/2021-working-papers/wp-2113-impact-of-covid19-stimulus-checks-on-retail-trading-in-bitcoin.aspx&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/newsroom-and-events/publications/working-papers/2021-working-papers/wp-2113-impact-of-covid19-stimulus-checks-on-retail-trading-in-bitcoin.aspx&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;3.8% is still impactful, but probably nowhere near as high as people would have expected. Much less the source of the majority of the trading.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;The true effect of the stimulus checks.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The stimulus checks still had some effect.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But not so much in creating or increasing the bull market, but in compensating and decreasing the negative macros and fears of the Covid crisis.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The market was in high fear of businesses closing, and going into a bear market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The stimulus checks wiped out a lot of that fear.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The effect didn&amp;amp;#39;t come so much from the stimulus checks going into crypto, as the data shows, but came more in a psychological way in wiping out the fear of a bear market from the Covid crisis, just enough to allow the crypto bull market to resume.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The stimulus check didn&amp;amp;#39;t add much money or liquidity to crytpo, but it kept average Joe from running out of money, and removed the pitfall of Covid, to allow the crypto bull market to continue to run free and unimpeded.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;According to &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.coinbase.com/the-rise-of-crypto-in-higher-education-81b648c2466f&quot;&amp;gt;this study&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; from 2018 (surely the number is higher currently), 42% of top 50 universities offer a course in blockchain or cryptocurrencies.  Here&amp;amp;#39;s a list of schools offering courses in crypto that I know of or was able to find with a quick search, in no particular order. If you know of any more, please comment and I&amp;amp;#39;ll add it to the list. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;MIT&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Harvard&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Cornell&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;New York University&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Princeton&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Columbia&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Stanford&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Carnegie Mellon&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Duke&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Georgetown&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Obviously, this is quite a long list.  I think it&amp;amp;#39;s only a matter of time before we see an explosion of adoption in this space.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

You can check the data of previous crashes and make some conclusions. This is not advice, but if you’re in the group that thinks that “history repeats itself” it could be a good idea to wait a few months until the stock market and the crypto market dumps again and find a better enter position.
On the other side, I think that is not a bad idea to start a DCA strategy since we are really low in prices right now, specially BTC and ETH. I’m sure they will dump in the future, but maybe not enough to try to time the bottom.
Anyways, this year can be a great opportunity to buy if you believe in crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
