On the other side we all also want that Crypto just keeps doing 10x every year so that we make a lot of money.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Don&amp;amp;#39;t know about you but having something as a world currency that occasionally does a 10x up and down, seems chaotic to say the least.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And I personally think it&amp;amp;#39;s completly okay to see Crypto as a investment than a currency right now. But I would also say that at one point Crypto will be so big that it would be stabke on the price. Meaning we won&amp;amp;#39;t see any major dips but also not any 10x or so over a short period. This may be the only way of Crypto as a currency.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Obviously we all want to make some money but the greater cause of Crypto wouod not fulfill that. And I&amp;amp;#39;m ready that one day Crypto won&amp;amp;#39;t be as fun as today but more useful to everyone.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now there is almost $600m  worth coins stolen from this shit show that the hacker will be looking to dump. While CEX have blacklisted the hacker&amp;amp;#39;s address already, nothing is stopping him from dumping all of it on DEX. He can play with the market though cashing out would seem difficult at this point. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Even Tornado cash is not 100% fool proof, as the recent NFT rugpull bust by DOJ suggests.. In that case the rug pull scammers used tornado to wash their coins but still got caught.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In this case it seems the hacker is already sending funds to CEX which means he is most likely KYCed or using fakes..&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Who doesn&amp;amp;#39;t have them these days. And we all have tons of apps for our portfolio management. We got our FIAT banking apps, we got the CEX apps. we got wallet apps and then browser for accessing the ones that don&amp;amp;#39;t have a dedicated app and finally logged into our account and an authenticator app.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With so many apps and so many passwords I bet you that we all have unknowingly used save password or better copy pasted or clicked a photo of our seed phrase. So many internet and crypto etiquttes are broken just for the sake of convinience.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When does this come to bite our behind ?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The first obvious one is losing our phone. But you know, accidents like dropping it in water and damage usually destroy it or once we lose it it runs out of charge. Even then, getting into it requires passords or some biometrics. And we can remotely lock our devices too if someone where to get in.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But what if I bring to your imagination a nightmare even more simple ? You have to give your phone for service. Now we all aren&amp;amp;#39;t the richest people in the world and definitely I am not. After dropping my phone and cracking the screen, the first thing I do is see if I can still use it with the display still cracked.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To my dismay, I saw rainbows and a epiliptic touchscreen that refused to obey. The next course of action is to curse a few suitable words and then look up the price of servicing it. Oh boy, a week to service and half the phone&amp;amp;#39;s cost to do it. Hell no. And buying a new one is even more expensive.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And here is the conundrum. I go and give it for service at the local shop that uses questionable parts but is cheaper and will get it done by the next day.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But here&amp;amp;#39;s the kicker, they need my phone&amp;amp;#39;s password.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;And that my friend is the stake through the heart.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Immediately I tell them &amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Actually let me just quickly go home and get the money for this&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; and go back home to assess my options &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;AKA steps to secure your funds&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Sign out of Google:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; This will ensure that your authenticator will be disabled as well as accessing your cloud data is disabled as well. No accessing your password manager so your sins are forgiven.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Sign out of your CEX:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Not all CEX have this so verify now the ones that you use allow you to remotely signout of your accounts. This is needed in case your phone&amp;amp;#39;s display or touch fails&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Remove your SIM card:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; If you have a physical SIM card, remove it. This will prevent them from trying to access through SMS 2 factor authentication which a lot of CEX and banking apps use by default.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Block withdrawls:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; If you can block withdrawls for a certain amount of time then better do that until you get your phone back.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Delete seed phrase images or copy pastes:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; If you can access the cloud backup and delete it then better do it.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;If you have the seed phrase as a local file on your phone then you are pretty much screwed. Someone can simply download metamask and use your seedphrase.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So there, this was one hell of a 24 hours for me and gladly it seems they didn&amp;amp;#39;t tamper with my phone. But it really did hit me like a hammer when I went to the shop and finally before giving the phone they asked for my password.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hope this made you think twice of your security status. And stay safe everyone&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Well he was also super for Canada locking bankaccounts of terrorists. (Which I get. I felt like the government was showing why decentralization was important and them locking accounts should not be allowed.) &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I told him it was a direct response to the events in Canada and he should just hold a cold wallet or something. He went on about it being too far and punishing normal people for a few bad apples. I said this is what people mean when they talk about a slippery slope. How would you identify those individuals face cameras? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Long story short. Don&amp;amp;#39;t be okay with governments punishing people that you don&amp;amp;#39;t politically agree with. Eventually you may be on the other end or lumped up with them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

They launched the token this past Friday and were supposed to set a low max buy limit but somehow mess this up, allowing some investors to purchase more than almost 100x than they should have. Once the devs caught their mistake they reset the buy limit and announced that they would blacklist the wallets that were able to purchase the larger amounts.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One of the persons who got blacklisted found an exploit with Saitamask and drained all of the liquidity out of the SaitaRealty LP. He bragged about it on Twitter and got away with at least $1.2 million that investors put into the new project. He did so without touching the SaitaReality he bought with the blacklisted wallet. No one that bought SaitaRealty can cash out now as there is 0 liquidity left. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Somehow the thief was able to trick Saitamask into swapping ETH for 10x the amount of Saitama he should have received and then swap that for SaitaRealty all in one transaction. He then Swapped back the SaitaRealty for Saitama, cashed that out to ETH, and transferred the ETH to another wallet to tumble.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here is a screenshot of the instant 10X he was able to trick the Saitamask router into doing:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/4svyvi2jq8q81.png?width=1798&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=d0d95aaa033bc2dd0a043f0fae9f36d442155c5d&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/4svyvi2jq8q81.png?width=1798&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=d0d95aaa033bc2dd0a043f0fae9f36d442155c5d&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can see one of his transactions here:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://etherscan.io/tx/0x18bd50dc00ef034bcf28480e8744e8af4150155353846fb8fe36d7af56071139&quot;&amp;gt;https://etherscan.io/tx/0x18bd50dc00ef034bcf28480e8744e8af4150155353846fb8fe36d7af56071139&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here is the wallet he did the exploit with if you want to see how it all went down:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://etherscan.io/address/0xad0c834315abfa7a800bbbb5d776a0b07b672614&quot;&amp;gt;https://etherscan.io/address/0xad0c834315abfa7a800bbbb5d776a0b07b672614&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here is the wallet he used to tumble the stolen funds with.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://etherscan.io/address/0x63493e679155c2f0aad5bf96d65725ad6427fac4&quot;&amp;gt;https://etherscan.io/address/0x63493e679155c2f0aad5bf96d65725ad6427fac4&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The thief deleted his Twitter account but here is a screenshot of a post he made about what he did. Note that PeckShield Inc. from his quote tweet is a crypto-security company that tried to alert the team about what was happening. The Saitama team did not realize what was happing until all the money was gone, even though security experts tried to warn them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/k4gih0nar8q81.png?width=464&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=6b9c92d61d17f6ced8c898b7438fd7a2195dfb8d&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/k4gih0nar8q81.png?width=464&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=6b9c92d61d17f6ced8c898b7438fd7a2195dfb8d&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Saitama devs hosted a Twitter space the next day and claimed that the thief was running arbitrage through Uniswap. This is not what happed and anyone who can understand transactions on Ethescan can clearly see that their claim is false. The instant 10x exploit happed directly and fully through the Saitamask router.  All of these transactions happened fully within Saitamask contracts as you can see in the transaction above. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The devs know all of this and are covering it up. The fact that the devs are sweeping this under the rug and have kept the swap open seems criminal to me. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here you can see the liquidity is completely gone and investors are currently unable cash out:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/lz1zfwpfr8q81.png?width=2830&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=73bc18e2d3c178f37950834f21d3de9f381c2d6b&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/lz1zfwpfr8q81.png?width=2830&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=73bc18e2d3c178f37950834f21d3de9f381c2d6b&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you got this far how do you think the devs should have handled this? While all of this was going on the devs were actively encourage Saitama holders to take part in a listing competition with OKX, and they will now be listed there.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;What is VINU?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Vita Inu (VINU) is the world&amp;amp;#39;s first zero-fee, light-speed, dog coin with smart contracts!&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is a token built on the Vite network in November 2021 by Vite enthusiasts. Much like Nano (XNO), Vite is a DAG network with near-instant transaction times and zero fees. But in addition to that, Vite is the first public chain to implement smart contracts on the basis of a DAG ledger. Because of this, VINU is the world&amp;amp;#39;s first dog coin with near-instant transaction times, zero fees, and smart contracts! VINU is also proudly the #1 project on the Vite chain.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;VINU&amp;amp;#39;s philosophy is to provide education about cryptocurrencies in a fun and ethical way. It does so by building a fun and engaging community around the cryptocurrency project. It is also currently sponsoring a&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/i_fly_high_/status/1507916290706456577&quot;&amp;gt; blockchain awareness program in India&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; (and previously&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/VitaInuCoin/status/1469982262066176005&quot;&amp;gt; Nepal&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;), and will continue to do more for blockchain awareness elsewhere on the globe.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;VINU is unlike other memecoins. First, VINU is committed to paying all its community members fairly for their contributions to the project. Members receive VINU as rewards for moderating social media and community platforms, organising events, creating artwork, and so on. Second, VINU leans into transparency in legal compliance, with legal opinions valid in the EU and US. Last but not least, VINU is committed to the fair distribution of a significant portion of its total supply.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;VINU even has its own &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;tipbot&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; right here on Reddit, where our community can tip tokens without transaction fees &amp;amp;amp; you’ll see it in action in the comments and over at our subreddit!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here’s some of VINU’s achievements in the past five months since its creation:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;And there’s much more planned for the project – including a &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;metaverse (“Vinuverse”)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; with a full &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;VR World&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, a &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;decentralized swap (“VinuSwap”)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;NFTs&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Games&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, and more.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As you can see, VINU is clearly one of the top dogs!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The giveaway will end in 48 hours, or when I run out of VINU, whichever is faster.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Don&amp;amp;#39;t miss your chance at getting yourself some free VINU!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Questions?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hop over to OUR REDDIT or join the community on&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://discord.gg/vitainu&quot;&amp;gt; Discord&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; or&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://t.me/vitainu&quot;&amp;gt; Telegram&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Our friendly neighborhood community moderators will be ready to help you!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;NOTE: We would be remiss not to point out that we’ve been hugely inspired by the Nano giveaways on this sub in the past. In fact, Vite and VINU were created to allow &amp;amp;quot;feeless &amp;amp;amp; instant&amp;amp;quot; to be brought to Web3, and a significant number of team members from both projects were/are active Nano community members.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;EDIT:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;- Didn&amp;amp;#39;t receive a reply after posting your Vite address? This may be because the accounts making the comments have been rate-limited by Reddit. You should still have received your rewards. Verify all successful transactions here:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://vitcscan.com/address/vite_68e5d1a2e3913c31628841cc54d67da6bcf2beb4eb5860663a&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;http://vitcscan.com/address/vite_68e5d1a2e3913c31628841cc54d67da6bcf2beb4eb5860663a&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;- Didn&amp;amp;#39;t receive your VINU? This may be because the script that&amp;amp;#39;s handling the giveaway is stalling. We&amp;amp;#39;ll be monitoring its activity throughout the day, but there may be some gaps here and there. You&amp;amp;#39;ll receive your VINU, regardless!&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;- Getting an error from the faucet? This may be because your account is entirely new, and unopened. Once you receive your VINU from this giveaway, you should be able to start using the faucet.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I noticed something interesting about the current upswing in the market. When you set the BTC/USD chart to a 5 minute interval, you can clearly see only one massive order (or batch of orders) within 5 minutes started this price hike.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/j0sbflvux4q81.png?width=1241&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=88d9bdd33fc6ee760e479237cca70ddbdc1699ad&quot;&amp;gt;One massive 5m candle&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s reasonable to assume that only one whale was behind this and to me it&amp;amp;#39;s kinda frightening how one person or institution can move the whole market like that.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So maybe when the price rises high enough we will see an opposite candle of the whale selling and taking a nice profit and the market will be where it started. Or this was just done to liquidate shorts. Either way I would not treat the current positive price development as a new market wide trend just yet.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What do you guys think, am I being too paranoid?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: Link to the chart I used (you should be able to confirm that candle on any trading platform though): &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT?layout=pro&amp;amp;amp;type=spot&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT?layout=pro&amp;amp;amp;type=spot&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Set time to 5m on the top left.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit2: Because someone in the comments asked, here is the same 5 minute view around the time of the last ATH of 69k. This time the buys were spread out over ~45 minutes which looks a bit more (but not entirely) organic to me. But keep in mind: Getting near the 69k took days of upwards price movement before this spike.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/2oec7wi6b5q81.png?width=1229&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=d16163ea73d8f2f7e0a32bfe646bea1dbbb653ce&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/2oec7wi6b5q81.png?width=1229&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=d16163ea73d8f2f7e0a32bfe646bea1dbbb653ce&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit3: One of the commenters pointed out that this could be &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://nitter.net/BTC_Archive/status/1508433143921102855?t=ikC7fnVDm9Xm9wq6Umn-4g&amp;amp;amp;s=19&quot;&amp;gt;Terras purchase of BTC reserves&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, though I&amp;amp;#39;d assume such huge trades would be done OTC, a portion of it could have been done on exchanges, dunno.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;11 days ago, ApeCoin was listed on many major exchanges. And don&amp;amp;#39;t get me wrong, I personally would never buy it - even in the speculative world of crypto, meme coins are a bit too risky for me, and Bored Apes look horrible and I don&amp;amp;#39;t get the appeal. But I still thought it was funny how the hive mind decided right at release that it &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;hated&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; the token, that it would fail immediately with 100% certainty, at that every negative thing about it would be upvoted massively, no matter how misleading or plain wrong.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One week ago, there was a &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/tij5jr/apecoin_is_down_more_than_20_in_a_day_this_might/&quot;&amp;gt;short but very dramatic post&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, saying that it went down 20% in a single day - nothing too weird for a new coin - and that this was the last warning before the &amp;amp;quot;real dumping&amp;amp;quot; starts, and that &amp;amp;quot;Everyone knows that project gonna dump hard&amp;amp;quot;. Nobody can predict the market, but a hard dump soon after release was always pretty unrealistic, considering it builds on a pretty well known brand (everyone has heard of those disgusting Apes) and the tokens the founders and BAYC holders received are locked for a pretty long time. But, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/cc&quot;&amp;gt;r/cc&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; being &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/cc&quot;&amp;gt;r/cc&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, of course it received 3.8k upvotes because &amp;amp;quot;APE bad&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Since then, ApeCoin has gone up more than 50%. And sure, it&amp;amp;#39;s generally a green week, but currently it is ranked 3rd of the top 100 coins, so it grew much more than most others.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;I have no idea how ApeCoin will do in the future. It might become as big as SHIB or even Doge, or it might slowly lose value over time and leave the top 100 at some point. I know I won&amp;amp;#39;t buy any. But this is a good reminder that this sub, on average, is terrible at predicting the market, especially when it comes to meme coins. Once this sub decides to hate a coin, it will ALWAYS be convinced its end is near. I don&amp;amp;#39;t have any advice for you, except: don&amp;amp;#39;t take positive posts about this sub&amp;amp;#39;s favorite coins or negative posts regarding its least favorite coins too seriously.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

What&amp;amp;#39;s more ridiculous is that these guys explain why investing in crypto is bad whilst drinking expensive coffee,  wearing ridiculously expensive branded clothes etc.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I buy crypto instead of buying stupid stuff. I buy crypto instead of buying expensive alcohol,  or a pack of cigarettes. I buy crypto instead of buying a $200 sneakers. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I wish people realize that we invest in crypto cause we got some goals for which crypto is the only way. That&amp;amp;#39;s why I refrain from talking about crypto with anyone. They won&amp;amp;#39;t invest. First they&amp;amp;#39;ll judge us, then they&amp;amp;#39;ll burn in jealousy if we make money out of it or they&amp;amp;#39;ll ask for us to teach them. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This just piss me off, like alot. Yes there&amp;amp;#39;s risk in buying crypto, atleast it&amp;amp;#39;s better than burning money for ridiculous  things.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I used to care a lot about fundamentals and utility when I was investing in coins but now I just don&amp;amp;#39;t see the point of caring about fundamentals. Some person creates a shit coin and pays influencers to shill his coin in order to create a fake hype and boom, that coin is in top 20 without any use case and utility. Excuse me but what the fuck?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We almost lost our most important values, fundamentals, utility, a good dev team etc.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In a market where shitcoins sit easily in top 20 without any utility/use case, no one cares about fundamentals anymore.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Finally, I was out of these stocks and could buy assets I believe in. But I was stupid and greedy. The crypto market was going up and I wanted to wait for a red day to buy. It wasn&amp;amp;#39;t even that much of a difference, but since it was a large amount of cash (for me), it just felt better psychologically to buy on a dip.   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But the dip never came. 42k never dropped to 41. Instead it has been shooting up everyday all the way to 47 now and beyond. If I just would have bought at 42k, I would be done, happy, and not feel like an idiot for trying to time the market.   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So don&amp;amp;#39;t be me in the future. Don&amp;amp;#39;t try to time the market in hopes of getting a slightly better price (unless you are an expert trader, which I am not). The best way to make money in this crazy market is to buy the best cryptos (BTC, ETH, and maybe a few top L1s) and chill. I knew this and try to always do it, but I got greedy once and got burnt.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
