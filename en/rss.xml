&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Not only did they completly show a wrong chart but also the year number is wrong with &amp;amp;quot;2121&amp;amp;quot;.

Thats just straight up a LIE.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sounds like tomorrow&amp;amp;#39;s CPI reading is going to be painful. I&amp;amp;#39;m having a hard time understanding how &amp;amp;quot;we are in a better place than we were last month&amp;amp;quot; and yet headline inflation is also going to be &amp;amp;quot;extraordinarily elevated.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Full article text:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;by Christian Datoc, White House Reporter  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Biden administration is bracing for inflation to continue its historic rise when the March Consumer Price Index is published Tuesday morning.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters in Monday&amp;amp;#39;s briefing that while &amp;amp;quot;we are in a better place than we were last month,&amp;amp;quot; the administration expects &amp;amp;quot;headline inflation to be extraordinarily elevated due to Putin&amp;amp;#39;s price hike.&amp;amp;quot;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Psaki noted that the previous CPI report did not factor in jumps in energy prices brought about by the war in Ukraine but stressed that the United States is in &amp;amp;quot;a better place than we were last month.&amp;amp;quot;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;We expect a large difference between core and headline inflation, reflecting the global disruptions in energy and food markets,&amp;amp;quot; she continued. &amp;amp;quot;Of course, we know that core inflation, energy, the impact of energy, of course, on oil prices, gas prices — we expect that to continue to reflect what we&amp;amp;#39;ve seen the increases be over the course of this invasion.&amp;amp;quot;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Furthermore, Psaki used the opportunity to push Congress to pass the remainder of President Joe Biden&amp;amp;#39;s economic agenda and &amp;amp;quot;reduce costs for the American people.&amp;amp;quot;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;We have, of course, legislation that could do exactly that and cut the cost of childcare, of healthcare, of elder care,&amp;amp;quot; she stated. &amp;amp;quot;These all have enormous impacts on people&amp;amp;#39;s budgets, on when they&amp;amp;#39;re doing those calculations at their kitchen table, and certainly, this data will be a reminder of the need to do something and take additional steps.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now that we know for sure when it will hit $100k, it&amp;amp;#39;s time to take out a loan whilst being unemployed and FOMO it all into Bitcoin. Not only that, but let&amp;amp;#39;s talk to everyone we know and convince them to FOMO all their money in Bitcoin. What could go wrong, we have the word of experts. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Honestly though, I&amp;amp;#39;m already seeing articles about how Bitcoin will hit $100k by the end of 2022 and it feels like the same thing again that happened last year, namely, people expecting crazy gains because Bitcoin has moved up like 5%. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And this again will cause people invest in Bitcoin and expect to be rich by the end of the year, which is very unlikely, so they&amp;amp;#39;ll definitely be disappointed. I would say that we shouldn&amp;amp;#39;t really care how much Bitcoin will be this week, this month, or even this year. Why look at short term? Not like short term works with Bitcoin, because it&amp;amp;#39;s become a little stable compared to alts, and even they&amp;amp;#39;re not as volatile anymore to get you a lot of profits short term. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitcoin won&amp;amp;#39;t get you rich Short term, it&amp;amp;#39;s best to have patience and invest and wait. No, Waiting doesn&amp;amp;#39;t mean checking the charts every second of the day, simply DCA if you already do or forget about your investment. Patience does pay off.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hedera.com/&quot;&amp;gt;Hedera&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; is a fast, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://hedera.com/blog/going-carbon-negative-at-hedera-hashgraph&quot;&amp;gt;carbon-negative&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, open-source, public network with Solidity-based smart contracts to power decentralized applications and a &amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://hedera.com/council&quot;&amp;gt;fully decentralized governing council&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; of global organizations spanning across web3 projects, enterprises, and universities.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The core contributors of Hedera are focused on building functionalities, services, and developer tooling to support the same types of applications being funded by the HBAR Foundation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One of the most exciting things about building on Hedera right now is that the DeFi ecosystem is just getting started with the re-introduction of &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://hedera.com/blog/unblocking-and-unloading-the-speed-secrets-behind-hedera-smart-contracts-2-0&quot;&amp;gt;optimized Smart Contracts&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; — there are 750k+ account holders looking to use $HBAR and builders of NFT and DeFi applications will be the first ones to give them this opportunity. We’ve already seen significant organic growth in NFT marketplaces, browser wallet support, and related projects.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Hedera Apps&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hedera is home to hundreds of projects in the web3 space — here’s a &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bmgentile/status/1404570788951326724&quot;&amp;gt;tweet thread&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; outlining a few of those larger applications. Additionally, full case studies can be found &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hedera.com/users&quot;&amp;gt;here&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As HBAR Foundation ecosystem grants ramp up, we’ll begin to see massive development of retail-focused applications coming to Hedera, such as these ones available today:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;NFT marketplaces like &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://zuse.market/&quot;&amp;gt;Zuse&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://hashaxis.com/&quot;&amp;gt;HashAxis&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, and &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://launch.turtlemoon.io/&quot;&amp;gt;Turtlemoon&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Wallets with transaction signing like &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hashpack.app/&quot;&amp;gt;HashPack&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.venly.io/&quot;&amp;gt;Venly&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Network bridges like &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hashport.network/&quot;&amp;gt;HashPort&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Staking delegation apps like &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://hedera.staderlabs.com/&quot;&amp;gt;StaderLabs&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All of which have been built organically by the Hedera developer community.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Smart Contract Hackathon | Now - May 16th | $500k+ in prizes&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hedera is hosting a &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://hedera22.devpost.com/&quot;&amp;gt;Solidity smart contract hackathon&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; through May 16th with over $500k in prizes to be earned for building DeFi, DAO, NFT, and Payment focused applications.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Upcoming Milestones&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The product and ecosystem roadmap for Hedera can be found at &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://hedera.com/roadmap&quot;&amp;gt;https://hedera.com/roadmap&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A few things we’re especially excited about:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Community-run network nodes&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Staking of HBAR on Hedera (&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-improvement-proposal/blob/master/HIP/hip-406.md&quot;&amp;gt;HIP-406&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Developer tooling (web3.js and ethers.js support)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Social&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;________________________________________________________________________________________________________________&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Myths to Dispel&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Myth #1: Hashgraph consensus and Hedera’s services are proprietary&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Hedera’s network services, officially supported SDKs, and every developer tool is open source under an Apache 2.0 license. Hashgraph consensus &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://cointelegraph.com/news/hedera-governing-council-to-buy-hashgraph-ip-and-open-source-projects-code&quot;&amp;gt;will be open source this year&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; under an Apache 2.0 license. You can find the Hedera project’s GitHub here: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hashgraph/&quot;&amp;gt;https://github.com/hashgraph/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Myth #2: Developers building dapps on Hedera can’t contribute to the project&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://hips.hedera.com/&quot;&amp;gt;Hedera Improvement Proposals (HIPs)&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; include core protocol changes, as well as changes to the applications, frameworks, and protocols built on top of the Hedera public network and used by the community.The &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://hips.hedera.com/&quot;&amp;gt;goal of HIPs&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; is to have a place for everyone to propose new features, collect community thoughts and input on a particular issue, document all subject matters in one place, and provide a status on their implementation. You can view all of the HIPs and contribute here: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://hips.hedera.com/all.html&quot;&amp;gt;https://hips.hedera.com/all.html&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Myth #3: Hedera is a private, permissioned network for Enterprises&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The Hedera network is a public network infrastructure for everyone to anonymously create accounts and build decentralized applications on, without telling anyone who they are or performing KYC/AML.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The Hedera network today is operated by members of the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://hedera.com/council&quot;&amp;gt;governing council&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; — each of the 26 members independently operates and maintains an individual node in their own data center or public cloud, ensuring full decentralization of consensus. This year, Hedera is allowing for community nodes — any member of the Hedera community can independently operate a node and earn &amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://hedera.com/hbar&quot;&amp;gt;$HBAR&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. And in the future, the entire network will be permissionless. Read the “path to permissionless” whitepaper &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://hedera.com/hh-decentralization-of-consensus.pdf&quot;&amp;gt;here&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Myth #4: Hedera doesn&amp;amp;#39;t have performant smart contracts&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Hedera’s smart contracts 2.0 is an implementation of the Besu EVM (Solidity) that has been optimized for the Hedera network and hashgraph consensus. Solidity-based smart contracts on Hedera off the following benefits:

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;No congestion fees for gas  / all txn fees are fixed (&amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hedera.com/fees&quot;&amp;gt;www.hedera.com/fees&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;15 million gas / second&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;300+ txns / second&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Integration with the native Token Service on Hedera mapped to ERC-20, 721, 1155 standards, 10k txns per second, and $0.0001 txn fees.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Getting started with Hedera: A guide for devs and degens&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Developer Quickstart&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The easiest way as a developer to get started building on Hedera is by checking out the official Hedera documentation at &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.hedera.com/&quot;&amp;gt;https://docs.hedera.com/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and getting a testnet account from &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://portal.hedera.com/&quot;&amp;gt;https://portal.hedera.com&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; — we have &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.hedera.com/guides/docs/sdks&quot;&amp;gt;officially-supported SDKs&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; available in Java, Javascript, and Go.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.hedera.com/guides/getting-started/environment-set-up&quot;&amp;gt;Set up your environment&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Try &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.hedera.com/guides/getting-started/try-examples&quot;&amp;gt;examples&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.hedera.com/guides/resources/tutorials&quot;&amp;gt;tutorials&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, and &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.hedera.com/guides/resources/demo-applications&quot;&amp;gt;demo applications&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://hedera.com/discord&quot;&amp;gt;Join the developer community on Discord&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Degen Quickstart&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As a self-proclaimed degenerate holding $HBAR, you have opportunities to use that $HBAR for things like staking, minting, buying, and selling NFTs, and participating in DeFi applications.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Install the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hashpack.app/post/how-to-create-your-first-account-with-hashpack&quot;&amp;gt;HashPack&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; browser wallet extension on Chrome: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hashpack.app/post/how-to-create-your-first-account-with-hashpack&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.hashpack.app/post/how-to-create-your-first-account-with-hashpack&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Check out the various applications on Hedera of which you can connect to via HashPack: NFT marketplaces (over 400+ NFT projects and over $4M USD in aggregate transactions) like &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://zuse.market/&quot;&amp;gt;Zuse&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://hashaxis.com/&quot;&amp;gt;HashAxis&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, and &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://launch.turtlemoon.io/&quot;&amp;gt;Turtlemoon&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, network bridges to and from Ethereum and Polygon via &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hashport.network/&quot;&amp;gt;HashPort&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, and staking delegation apps like &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://hedera.staderlabs.com/&quot;&amp;gt;StaderLabs&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Edit on the title:  The funding allocated to the HBAR Foundation consisted of 5 billion hbars (approximately 10% of total supply), currently worth US $1 billion as of September 16th, 2021.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As you can see by the technical analysis and illustration above of Bitcoin&amp;amp;#39;s history, it is going down to 0. Considering the trend analysis above, you should all sell your Bitcoin before it hits 0. Do NOT zoom out, only look at 1D or 7D charts when reviewing Bitcoins history, otherwise you may say silly things like &amp;amp;quot;its literally just flat month over month lul&amp;amp;quot; or &amp;amp;quot;historically this same move has happened hundreds of times&amp;amp;quot; or &amp;amp;quot;bruh this isn&amp;amp;#39;t even a dip lol&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;IGNORE ALL THAT - Just focus on what makes you feel scared and worried about your decisions. See all that red below? RED BAD. Its gone down THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN ONE DAY. By my math, it will be zero in just a few more days.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now that I have educated you - Please sell your bitcoin. Act on that fear and worry, and I will even do you a favor. To allow all of you to exit at the best possible price, my friends and I will be market buying Bitcoin for the rest of the day to help you all exit your positions. You are all whalecome. And remember, do NOT zoom out, do NOT review historical data past 1 week, and FEEL AND SPREAD PANIC.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My first experience with Crypto was when someone from a different country sent me $100 fund to support for a business i proposed. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;LESN 1. Crypto closes the location gap for funding useful projects.
&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Few months after my first exposure, Bitcoin dropped from 10k to 4k. It took some time, but it came back up, now around 40k+&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;LESN 2. The market is very volatile, have faith or go home safely.
&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Later on, I decided to invest in Alt coins, i asked a knowledgeable friend for suggestions, and he suggested &amp;amp;quot;Coin X&amp;amp;quot; (name undisclosed).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I invested in Coin X a little and it showed signs of growth in the first few weeks. Not so long Coin X dipped, came back up then dipped again. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;LESN 3. Spare money is your safety net.
&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A few times, i tried swapping my initial investment between markets to Chase my losses. Ultimately lost on them too.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;LESN 4. You can&amp;amp;#39;t time the market, switching in between investments/markets can dip you into more losses than your initial.

LESN 5. It&amp;amp;#39;s just money, don&amp;amp;#39;t get attached to coins, it&amp;amp;#39;s not your religion and its not saving the world. if you lose your money there wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t be pity for you by the creators.
&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So i started receiving crypto payment for my freelance while looking for a day job. I hedl as an alternative to cashing out. The crash came and my assets are worth about 30% of the actual amount i got paid. Reminded me of LESN 3 and&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;LESN 6. DYOR doesn&amp;amp;#39;t mean you will not lose your money.
&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Finally.  Work in real life with your value skills, budget some of your savings for crypto. That way, losses hit you less and you&amp;amp;#39;d have the strength to continue (if you have to). That&amp;amp;#39;s one of the ways to the Financial Independence you want from crypto&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The largest single liquidation order happened on Bitmex - XBTUSD value of $10.00M.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There have been a lot of posts like this one about shorts being liquidated and people in the comments celebrating that shorts got &amp;amp;quot;rekt&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We have to show the other side as well and remind people that the opposite is also true, as $420.69 million was liquidated in just 24 hours.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;$300 million was wiped just from BTC, ETH, LUNA, SOL, DOGE and NEAR.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Remember, don&amp;amp;#39;t over leverage yourself on short or long, because you can get fucked both ways.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: While I was making this post the liquidations rose by $20 million, so it&amp;amp;#39;s at $440 million right now, but I left the old title for obvious reasons.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I so wish I was wrong, but it more and more feels like the early glory days are over and I am caught up in an elaborate scam. I can’t tell anyone to invest in crypto with a straight face. What a terrible investment, could have made more $ with a shitty savings account, and the time I wasted (and continue to waste), that’s the true tragedy.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

This is a copy/paste I found interesting and wanted to see how a maxi would form a rebuttal. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;————————————————————&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The most critical flaw in Bitcoin is its lack of privacy. If you give me your Bitcoin wallet address so that I can send you a payment, you immediately compromise your privacy. I can see as a matter of public record how much money you have in your Bitcoin wallet (there are messy workarounds to attempt to fix this problem, which we will address shortly). The same situation applies even if you are the one sending Bitcoin. Any recipient can then see how much money you have in your Bitcoin wallet, both now and in perpetuity. To understand how critical this privacy problem is, consider the following scenarios:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You are travelling through parts of a country with a medium to high violent crime rate. You need to use some of your Bitcoin to pay for something. If every person you transact with knows exactly how much money you have, this is a threat to your personal physical safety.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You are a business that receives a payment from a supplier. That supplier will be able to see how much money your business has, and therefore can guess at how price sensitive you are in future negotiations. They can see every single other payment you’ve ever received to that Bitcoin address, and therefore determine what other suppliers you are dealing with and how much you are paying those suppliers. They may be able to roughly determine how many customers you have and how much you charge your customers. This is commercially sensitive information that damages your negotiating position enough to cause you relative financial loss.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You are a private citizen paying for online goods and services. You are aware that it is common practice for companies to attempt to use ‘price discrimination’ algorithms to attempt to determine the highest prices they can offer future services to you at, and you would prefer they do not have the information advantage of knowing how much you spend and where you spend it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You sell cupcakes and receive Bitcoin as payment. It turns out that someone who owned that Bitcoin before you was involved in criminal activity. Now you are worried that you have become a suspect in a criminal case, because the movement of funds to you is a matter of public record. You are also worried that certain Bitcoins that you thought you owned will be considered ‘tainted’ and that others will refuse to accept them as payment.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;————————————————————&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Have a great day and remember no hate. This is just an opportunity to teach/learn/discuss.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Imo if you have to come to this level to make your point, you have already lost. This does nothing but fuel more hate, anger, resentment towards crypto bros, especially when so many are working towards making crypto inclusive to all irrespective of their financial conditions, yet prime spots are being given to clowns who shred USD bills. 13% of Americans live below the poverty line, 74% of Africans live below the poverty line. Showing them notes being shredded is a great way to win them over.. NOT!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Not only is it a shitty way to make any argument, it is also illegal - Section 33 of US Criminal Code prohibits defacement of currency notes with jail term for offenders. Exhibitions like Bitcoin Conference are giving airtime and promoting clowns who act in utter defiance of established laws. Im sure this is gonna go down well with all those who already accuse crypto of enabling criminals. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There is just no reason these ass clowns should be given time or credibility over people like Andreas Antonopolous who actually work towards educating people on crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Others believe that we are early. I believe that both of those answers are wrong.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TLDR: No we are not early so much that $1000 in BTC will make you rich. But also you are not late to the party.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitcoin exist since 2009.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitcoin first transaction happened in May 2010, 16 months after its creation. We are talking about Bitcoin when its price was less then a cent.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Right now, I still don&amp;amp;#39;t see a massige global adoption, but I believe that it is coming.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto is a young space, vast majority of crypto coins in top100 are less then five years old.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This kind of investment is a little bit hard to understand for a lot of people, that is why maybe we don&amp;amp;#39;t see growth as much as we hope. Or we are just expecting too much way too fast. Crypto is complicated and we can all agree on that. So were other technologies in the begining.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Advanced technologies like &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;internet&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; are good example. Internet was invented in 1983.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In 1993 we had around 14 million users of internet worldwide.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In 1994 we had around 25 million users worldwide.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In 1995 we had around 44 million users worldwide.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I said worldwide? Actually, most of these users were from America btw.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Those are low numbers considering what we have today almost 5 billion users (at least devices) on internet. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This also shows that often it takes many years for people to start adopting new technologies. You know, back in the days there was no web browsers. To start using internet you had to type commands on some ugly black and white, or green screen.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Today, we have more then 300 million people that used or are still using crypto in some way, while 18,000 business are accepting them as a form of payment - &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://triple-a.io/crypto-ownership/&quot;&amp;gt;Source.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;According to data acquired by Finbold, about 10.2 percent of the global population using the internet owns some form of cryptocurrency - &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theportugalnews.com/news/2022-02-14/10-of-the-global-population-owns-cryptocurrency/65227&quot;&amp;gt;news source&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So basically, crypto users are growing globally fast. Maybe just not fast as you would like to.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Take a look at this chart I found on the web, it shows that the crypto has the fastest rate of adoption compared to other technologies in our world.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/mm0inikgdss81.png?width=934&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=bf750bc5d5b99e92aff724a207e092a1fc6d2e95&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/mm0inikgdss81.png?width=934&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=bf750bc5d5b99e92aff724a207e092a1fc6d2e95&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The way I see it, people are talking it is &amp;amp;quot;too late&amp;amp;quot; because they don&amp;amp;#39;t believe that they will see massive gains if they invest $1000 in BTC. Well, you probably won&amp;amp;#39;t get rich with it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adopting a new technology is not a walk in the park, that is why a lot of us here says &amp;amp;quot;be patient&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There is more then 16,000 cryptocurrencies today, and if we take a look at 2017 we will see that a lot of them went really down, or really dead.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It probably is going to happen again with a lot of cryptocurrencies.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It will take time, but the way I see it, you are not late, crypto is yet to come, and I don&amp;amp;#39;t really think that this can be stopped.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you start investing today you are still early, but not too early. You are 100% not late.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Immediately after the event, a branch of the central bank RBI issued a strange statement:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/radhbvkqwrs81.jpg?width=1448&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=b12fd2a4ec8dc631a5cc6439a7914836c2f1acfd&quot;&amp;gt;They are not aware of any crypto exchange using UPI&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As a result, it seems Coinbase has wound up its operations within just 3 days.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/coinbase-halts-upi-payments-for-crypto-within-three-days-of-india-launch-122041100027_1.html&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/coinbase-halts-upi-payments-for-crypto-within-three-days-of-india-launch-122041100027_1.html&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto continues to be discriminated, but you can use UPI on a host of gambling apps where people are way more likely to lose all of their money. The odds of winning in a gambling app is terribly low, even if it is disguised as fantasy sports. Some utterly shitty games like Rummy are supported on UPI.. but investing in crypto is blocked lol. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Such decisions show that UPI can never be a real global settlement layer. If legit businesses like Coinbase can be kicked off at will, it is not a neutral settlement layer. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;RBI is a strong opponent of crypto and has hit out multiple times against crypto with latest attacks referencing outdated claims from 2013.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;2020 saw some insane gains for Layer 1s and sadly I started investing in June of 2021. I do believe there are still huge gains to be made, but I wonder what the market cap of crypto will be in even 3-5 years. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Corporations, unions, associations and individuals can donate&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; to the Financial Freedom PAC but they cannot donate with U.S. dollars.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;By giving users cleaner drugs, off the dangerous streets, and by using anonymized money, it was largely a peaceable alternative to the often deadly violence so commonly associated with the global drug war, and street drug transactions!               &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Furthermore, the website had safe usage forums with information mechanisms for safer and more responsible forms of recreational drug use; something you certainly won’t get on the streets or from Google.           &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Silk Road showed us an (imperfect yet forward thinking) way to overcome issues involved with drug use, but lawmakers only want to focus on punishment while casting crypto as this dirty tool for dirty people.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;they say words are powerful. the 10 commandments were the law of the land, and were so significant that God himself put them on a solid piece of medium. so why not your seed phrases? you worked your ass off and put up with alot of shit to earn that money. and remember, those 12/24 words literally contain all your hard earned money. paper burns. software wallets are risky. get a hardware wallet and preserve your money, and get its seeds! think of it like this: your seed phrases are the DNA that contains all your earnings if ever your drunk ass drops your Ledger/Trezor/phone in the pool. as long as your seeds are intact, you can clone your funds on another wallet. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;now here is a cheap and easy method for preserving your precious crypto DNA:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;1 square stainless steel plate. 3mm thick, 100mm&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2.&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; cost = $10&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;make sure its stainless so it doesnt rust. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;3mm letter and number punches = $10. 
works better than a tungsten pen. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;a stamp holder so you dont bash your thumbs (health is wealth!) = $3, or 3D print your own&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;a small hammer= $2&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;duct tape = $1&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;stamp your phrases. give it a firm wack! and when you are done, wrap your plate in layers of duct tape to cover the words and make it &amp;amp;quot;tamper proof&amp;amp;quot;. done. no need for screws or another plate. no need for washers and other small pieces. doesnt look fancy. hide that shit somewhere. and sleep easy. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;total cost: $25. no need to pay $50-$100 on other fancy shit, put it on BTC instead. want to make backups? just buy another plate instead of spending another $50-100.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;edit: you can also use 1.2mm or 1.5mm thick stainless steel plates: if that thickness is good enough for guns, its good enough for your money!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You notice other coins pumping, not yours. So you start to wonder, should I switch? If you switch your old coins will pump in front of your eyes. Then you see your portfolio dropped to nasty lows. After which it goes up. All in all you check your portfolio daily to experience the thrill of huge increases.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Investing suddenly is a lot more difficult. The long term perspective didn&amp;amp;#39;t change. The emotional roller-coaster makes it hard. Your chasing new coins makes it hard. You make it hard. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Most of us will be best of, investing, waiting, and profiting. Patience. Eventually, your portfolio will pump too.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I messaged Metamask Support and they confirmed it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot; &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Please note, there are an ever increasing number of phishers on other sites pretending to be MetaMask Support. MetaMask support team will never ask for your seed phrase or private key! We will never need to &amp;amp;quot;connect to&amp;amp;quot;, &amp;amp;quot;synchronize&amp;amp;quot;, or &amp;amp;quot;update the firmware&amp;amp;quot; of your Metamask wallet for any reason. &amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While it may seem obvious to many here, scammers wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t be trying if they didn&amp;amp;#39;t think people would fall for it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is just a friendly heads up...have a good weekend&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

They do not care about the price, they do not care about the speed of Cardano. As long as Charles Hoskinson makes videos, they will buy ADA every week and stake all of it forever. And lets face it, Charles will never stop making videos.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
Don&amp;amp;#39;t get me wrong, Cardano can become a formidable blockchain for sure, but I also think that ADA will stay in the top 10 even if it literally stops working for years, as long as Charles makes videos about how everything is proceeding according to plan. That&amp;amp;#39;s the reason why I have some Cardano in my Portfolio and maybe you should too.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The only reason i trusted them is because they are listed as a trusted partner of Ledger and Exodus &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Summary about what happened -&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I tried to exchange 0.4349346 BTC ($19800) to 19740.61 DAI (ERC20) on April 4th. 
Exchange ID - q3pavhd2w7t6x591&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Changelly deposit address - 3EToheb4cTMP59YW5AwmYFwmzE1z2myYC2
Image - &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://picbun.com/p/XDSmueT8&quot;&amp;gt;https://picbun.com/p/XDSmueT8&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That was 6 days ago. After several minutes, I noticed that my exchange is on hold and there was an alert telling me to complete KYC verification. I completed KYC verification soon as i could. Changelly uses a 3rd party KYC authentication service called Sumsub for this.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Even after successful KYC verification through Sumsub, my exchange was still on hold. After a few minutes, another alert appeared asking me to contact &amp;lt;a href=&quot;mailto:security@changelly.com&quot;&amp;gt;security@changelly.com&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
Image - &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://picbun.com/p/lQdrSBh5&quot;&amp;gt;https://picbun.com/p/lQdrSBh5&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“I got a hold asking me to fill in kyc details.
I completed that and the verification was successful. However the transaction still says that its on hold. How long will it take?”
This was my first message to them. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;5 minutes later they replied to me with this message.
Image - &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://picbun.com/p/V2U7qSZx&quot;&amp;gt;https://picbun.com/p/V2U7qSZx&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
They were asking me to submit evidence to prove that i own the bitcoin. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So i took images of my wallet and replied to them with those images.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They replied to me with this 
“Could you please specify how you obtained the BTC in question? Were they purchased, traded, or mined - for instance?”

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I told them that i met up with my friend irl and bought btc from him using cash. I always use him for buying btc because my cards aren’t compatible with bitcoin purchase sites.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then they sent me a long list bitcoin addresses and told me to confirm which ones are mine
Only few of them were mine and i showed them a screenshot of my addresses inside electrum wallet. I also sent them plaintext list of those addresses to make it easier for them

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They replied to that asking me to tell my friend to contact them so that they can have his KYC verified

At this point, i felt like i was being scammed by changelly. My friend was not a customer of changelly and there was no need for him to complete KYC (Know your Customer).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I knew that my friend wouldn’t want to trust an exchange with his personal information and documents. But i cried and begged him to do the kyc checks. He reached out to changelly and completed KYC checks within an hour.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After his successful KYC verification, they replied to him and demanded proof of ownership of the bitcoin he sent to me originally. He started getting doubts about their legitimacy at this point. He suspected that they were trying to trap us into a KYC/AML loop

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But because of my constant cry for help, he decided to move forward and disclosed to them that the source of funds was paxful.com
Image - &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://picbun.com/p/cydKdMkm&quot;&amp;gt;https://picbun.com/p/cydKdMkm&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Changelly asked him if the sender wallet addresses (from paxful to my electrum wallet) belonged to him or not. He told them that the addresses technically belong to Paxful because its an exchange, not a Decentralised wallet. On the same email, he told them that they are supposed to do KYC/AML checks on me BEFORE the exchange initiation on changelly. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After hours of no replies, changelly replied asking him for screenshots of transactions from paxful to my electrum wallet.
He sent them 3 screenshots which were of the 3 largest transactions to my 3 wallet addresses.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Changelly verified the source of funds and sent him this response saying the case is being reviewed.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Since there were no updates even after 1 day, my friend emailed them again asking for updates and they replied with this 
“Please be informed that once there are any updates we will immediately let you know. “&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;2 days passed, me and him have been emailing them multiple times. My friend even requested them to “Return bitcoin to original sender” if they cannot carry out the exchange. But they never replied to any of it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On 6th of April, they replied saying that review of the case could take “months”. 
Image - &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://picbun.com/p/uny8rBA9&quot;&amp;gt;https://picbun.com/p/uny8rBA9&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
Why would it take months if me and my friend already verified KYC and proved source of funds??&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At that point, i was losing my mind. From 7th of April to today 10th of April, i have emailed them daily asking for updates. They never even replied to my emails once.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I realised that they have scammed. I started to look around on the internet to see if someone else had the same experience. Surprisingly, i have found several similar stories by just googling for “changelly kyc” and on reddit alike&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I have no idea what to do anymore except share my experience. I’m completely helpless. This was my life savings. Losing that kind of money is unbearable to me and i have been depressed for the past week. Anything anyone can do to help my situation will be appreciated. Sharing to more people for awareness, legal advices about what to do etc - anything would help.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Reddit is my last hope..&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Strike CEO Jack Mallers announced at the Bitcoin 2022 conference in Miami that eligible U.S. Shopify merchants will now be able to accept bitcoin payments from customers around the world as U.S. dollars.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Mallers, a Forbes Under 30 alum, also mentioned that Strike, based in Chicago, has teamed with NCR NCR, the world&amp;amp;#39;s largest point-of-sale (POS) supplier, and payments business Blackhawk.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;By leveraging the Lightning Network, a second layer built on top of the bitcoin blockchain that allows users to send and receive cryptocurrency quickly and cheaply by moving transactions off of the main blockchain, the integration provides an alternative to traditional card networks such as Visa V and MasterCard. According to Mallers, the service would be available to anybody in the world who has a Lightning Network-enabled wallet, which includes more than 70 million CashApp users.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The announcement demonstrates the Lightning Network&amp;amp;#39;s growing popularity. Robinhood announced intentions to integrate the solution into its technological stack earlier today, joining companies such as cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, Twitter, and Block. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Lightning Labs, a California-based developer of the Lightning Network, announced a new protocol on Tuesday that it hopes would allow the Lightning Network to accept assets other than bitcoin, such as other household names like Ethereum and the new ones like $Darc, stablecoins and fiat currencies.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
