&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But few really knew how hard can it be to hodl through a market crash.
Fewer even knew the toll it will take on your mental health.
And they were mostly 2018 market crash survivors.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Most of us who bought at 2021 bull run are suffering heavy losses. If we sell of course.
It is really hard not to panic. And even harder to see your 10k worth 2k.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I wish we all have strength to hold and wisdom to buy instead of panic selling because this is the correct time to buy and not at peak hype of 2021.
And those of us who hold through this will get rewarded. And if you came out of this mess with a nice profit, when someone talks about how lucky you were, you owe it to yourself to tell them to go F themselves.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Have a great day&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I just want to share it with someone and sadly I don&amp;amp;#39;t know anyone involved in crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When CRO sunk, I sold my $ 10k worth of CRO and bought LUNA. I was already at loss but somehow I saved 10k. Before they were 20k. CRO was 50% of my whole portfolio. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yesterday my 10k became 2500$. I was shocked that 20k became 2.5k just because someone decided to make a mess. I have no problem with normal fluctuations, I invest in crypto since 2 years and I don&amp;amp;#39;t panic when the market is not bullish. But man, cro and Luna did a mess because of their owners! It&amp;amp;#39;s different! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I never did margin trading. I always just bought and hold relevant projects. My initial and only investment was 400$ 2 years ago, I&amp;amp;#39;m not rich and all my portfolio was built by holding. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I decided to take 1250$ and use it to short Luna. It was worth 25$. I went to sleep and this morning it was worth 15$. I was so happy for few seconds, then I realized that I got liquidated during the night so I actually lost all.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I ended up with my last 1250$.
Luna was still falling. I decided to put everything and short it again. 
It went down to 9$, I took profit and short it again by reinvesting everything (previous profit included). &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It went down to 6$, I took profit and short it again everything I had. Now my liquidation price was 6.1$&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It went down to 4$. If I sold, I would take back almost everything I lost. I decided to wait, I suffered to much because of this mess and I deserved to get a full refund.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It went up to 5.5$. I started to panic. Just few cents and I would get liquidated. You&amp;amp;#39;ll never believe me, but for few seconds it went up to 6.15$, I throw away my phone thinking I got liquidated, but for some mysterious reason it didn&amp;amp;#39;t happen.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I checked back my phone after 1 hour. LUNA was now worth 2.90$ and I realized I didn&amp;amp;#39;t get liquidated! I closed my position and thanked the Gods of crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;ll never margin trade again, I&amp;amp;#39;ll never invest in shady projects, I&amp;amp;#39;ll keep investing in btc, ETH and few others like I always did before.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Most will likely chalk this up to a conspiracy theory but after having seen the manipulation Citadel is capable of from a certain stonk over the last year and a half I honestly personally 100% believe the theory. In the last couple months Ken Griffin was already in the news talking about essentially becoming a market maker for the crypto markets. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They are already experts at profiting off of destroying companies on the US market through criminal means even in a regulated market so if you don&amp;amp;#39;t think they could do so in an unregulated crypto market you are naive. Heed my words, they are looking to be top dogs in the crypto markets to make manipulation even easier for them, this is just the beginning. If they become &amp;amp;quot;market makers&amp;amp;quot; in the crypto markets then anyone who&amp;amp;#39;s long on their coins should be worried. If you personally don&amp;amp;#39;t believe the theory that&amp;amp;#39;s fine but you can&amp;amp;#39;t argue that&amp;amp;#39;s it&amp;amp;#39;s not certainly plausible if you&amp;amp;#39;ve done any DD on Citadel.   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For those who are not familiar with the theory yet here&amp;amp;#39;s a quick ELI5&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Citadel borrows 100k BTC&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Trades 25k BTC for UST&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Opens a short&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Starts dumping 75k BTC aggressively&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Once BTC reached 30k they started dumping UST to make it lose its peg&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Now Kwon is forced to sell 25k BTC at a major loss to recover the peg, further dumping the price of BTC&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Meanwhile Citadel is shorting all the way&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;This is not the time to boast about your good decisions in other people&amp;amp;#39;s misery posts.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; People are attempting suicide. With people in this state, all it takes is a single comment reinforcing their &amp;amp;quot;dumb&amp;amp;quot; decisions for someone to take their lives away.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Please, please be gentle with your words during this time. Offer help, offer your presence if they need to talk.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We can talk about strategies and good/bad decisions after the fire is put off. For now, let&amp;amp;#39;s just be human beings and support whoever is feeling lost in this shitstorm.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I just happened to be in crypto market since 2013.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Before we dive into the why of the message above, here are the kind of things everyone needs to be EXTREMELY CAREFUL about:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A lot of YouTube scammers and spammers are going to tout &amp;amp;quot;buy the dip&amp;amp;quot;, &amp;amp;quot;capitulation&amp;amp;quot;, &amp;amp;quot;steal deals&amp;amp;quot; and so on - do not fall for it. Doing your own research is more important than ever&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Doing your own research wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t do much in this environment - markets are in a tricky situation, globally, a very bad one.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Many projects will see MASSIVE corrections and many would not survive so be even more careful.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So, with that aside, let&amp;amp;#39;s dive in a bit more.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A significant downside risk still persists in the market and if (god forbid) another 1-2 bad news hit the market, we may end up seeing that downside - it may mean a &amp;amp;lt;$10K BTC and &amp;amp;lt;$1K ETH. Terra is already down 90% with its own bad news and market will not be nice to any assets if bad news keep hitting. Right now, likelihood of bad news is more than the good news. Russia-Ukraine situation can escalate beyond the two countries, China real estate is a ticking bomb, China lockdown may extend further, another major covid variant can set things really back etc.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The V-shape recovery from this crash is highly unlikely, no major stimulus plan is waiting this market crash at the end of the tunnel, this market crash is good for the government because it will tame down the inflation. So don&amp;amp;#39;t try to outsmart the market with short term trades.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All in all, don&amp;amp;#39;t fall for shitty and shady YouTubers and Crypto influencers on Twitter - nobody understands the market and macro signals are more geared towards downside risk than upside optimism.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;BE EXTREMELY CAUTIOUS IN EXECUTING ANY TRADE!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Good news - this shall pass too and we will emerge stronger with a bigger crypto market (shooting to $5-10T) but have patience and wait and watch.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;God bless us all!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Rushing out something barely even decentralised just to get rich off their token floating around in the space. But now Lightning has shown how nonsense these all are.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Right now, I&amp;amp;#39;m looking forward to seeing how crowdloan works.

Polkadot continues to roll out of the parachains, giving people the opportunity to earn a ton of free tokens. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;XCM will soon rollout allowing parachains to communicate with one another and secure token transfers between chains, among other things. On the existing parachains that have won a slot, projects are presently being built and launched.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These are just some random thoughts and I believe there is much more to come.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That being said, there is a glaring change of pattern between the previous bear market, against the current bear market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;table&amp;gt;&amp;lt;thead&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;th align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;Year&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;th align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;2013 - 2015&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;th align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;2018-2020&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;th align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;2022-2024 (?)&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/thead&amp;gt;&amp;lt;tbody&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;Peak Price&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;USD 1,149.14&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;USD 19,970&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;USD 69,050&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;Bear Market Low&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;USD 197.24&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;USD 3,109&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;USD 28,000-29,000 (?)&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;Drawdown&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;-83%&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;-84%&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&amp;gt;-58% (For now)&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/tbody&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/table&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Realistically, BTC does not go lower than its previous ATH, according to previous patterns. So, we probably won&amp;amp;#39;t see BTC going down below USD 19,970. This is why this current bear market is interesting. We are seeing possibly a &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;lowering in the drawdown&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The bear market is getting more and more bearable. Pun intended.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That being said, if you had entered into crypto this year, then the next point of exit should be by the next halving in 2024/2025. Although the current halving hasn&amp;amp;#39;t met the expectations yet, the previous halving would suggest that the metrics is rather promising. If you&amp;amp;#39;re concerned about the stock-to-flow model not meeting the prediction this time, consider that BTC had exceeded the stock-to-flow prices previously as well. It will eventually balances out.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However, you do need to pay additional considerations if you&amp;amp;#39;re jumping into alts.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yet you see all these articles about how crypto is dying and BTC  has crashed, dont fall for that crap. There are coins and projects that have and will fail, that is no doubt, some are just stupid. But the fundamentals and the concept of crypto is firm and secure. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The technology of ledgers and blockchains is here to stay, how a project or coin uses or misuses it is not proof that the technology is bad. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So look at crypto as an industry and technology not as just the coin or the market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I can’t believe how many people are, lack of a better word, brainwashed. I feel like it has been proven that the developers are engaging in shady practices and not ethical. I am thinking they will take that money and run at some point. Why do you think people are so adamant that it’s a legitimate project? The “CEO” reeks of charlatan. Also, I believe they incorporated a 90% claim tax or something like that to where it’s hard to take money out (not sure if that’s accurate). I am not a skeptical person but my God I just don’t get it. I truly feel bad for the investors because from the outside it seems crazy that someone would fall for some of the explanations heard from the Safemoon team regarding certain accusations. Anyway,  was curious to hear everyone’s thoughts. I’m obviously not an investor in the project and just trying to understand peoples mentality when it comes to projects like this. Appreciate some insight. Fascinating stuff. Cheers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: first of all I want to say that I appreciate all of the comments. I have learned several things so far. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt; I am wrong about the 90% claim tax and I guess it is 100% transfer tax which seems much better. (Please someone clean me up on this if I’m still wrong)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt; I am apparently a karma whore. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The Safemoon army is a passionate bunch. I can appreciate that. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;People that post about Safemoon just want the moons. I was not aware of this. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;There are people that have invested who understood that it was a longshot and invested only what they were willing to lose or made a little money early and got out. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Lots of bots in the Safemoon subreddit.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

It had the most explosive start of any coin I&amp;amp;#39;ve ever seen. It entered the top 10 immediately, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20210511041514/https://coinmarketcap.com/&quot;&amp;gt;even went to #4&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; for a few hours, with only BTC, ETH and BNB ahead of it. On the first day it was even listed on sites like Coingecko and Coinmarketcap! I remember thinking this was a bug when there suddenly was a new coin in the top 10.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Today, it is sitting solidly below $15, even went below $10 yesterday - what happened? Well, $700 was just absurdly overpriced, it seems. But to be fair, ICP has had incredibly bad luck with its timing, as it was released just days before Bitcoin&amp;amp;#39;s biggest crash in recent history, which dragged the whole market down with it. On May 10, BTC opened at &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;above $58&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, only 3 days later it opened below $50k and kept going down, to a low of  &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$30,681.50&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; on May 19.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;ICP was hit too, but much harder - I would guess it would have gone down from $700 even in a good market. There was quite a bit of up and down in the first few days, but it (at least temporarily, respectively) went below $400 on May 11, below $300 on May 12, below $200 on May 17 and below $100 on May 19. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;That&amp;amp;#39;s $700 to below $100 in nine days.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; There were a few ups and downs in the following days but it permanently went below $100 on June 8, less than a month after its release, and never returned.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You know what&amp;amp;#39;s impressive, though? You would expect a coin that has fallen more than 98% to be at like rank 300 or something at best. But nope, it is still sitting somewhere around #40 - &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;that&amp;amp;#39;s how absurdly high its market cap was!&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Happy birthday ICP, I&amp;amp;#39;m curios where you&amp;amp;#39;ll be in a year!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I mean, I haven&amp;amp;#39;t seen a suicide hotline posts stickied in months now. Some people argue that the fear and greed index (currently at 10) is the right way to go, and normally I agree, but I don&amp;amp;#39;t think this is a normal situation. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;History shows us (as far as BTC is concerned), bear market bring a 80% dump to BTC. Sure, sure, now we have a lot of institutional investors involved, who won&amp;amp;#39;t allow BTC to go down THAT much. And we&amp;amp;#39;re currently 50ish% down from BTC ATH. I was also under the impression that &amp;amp;quot;this time it&amp;amp;#39;s different&amp;amp;quot; and that BTC drops of around 80% are not as likely. But this is the first time BTC is around in a situation where we have a major global recession. Which is just now starting to show it&amp;amp;#39;s ugly teeth. So if you&amp;amp;#39;re thinking this is the bottom, you have another thing coming. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Don&amp;amp;#39;t make the mistake in thinking things will get easier over the next few weeks. It is highly likely that people will lose jobs. People will lose homes. We are still in a completely unregulated market. BTC and crypto will dump a lot more from this point. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you have a DCA strategy (and available FIAT now), sure, continue to buy weekly/monthly. Nothing wrong with this strategy. It is historically proven this is the best strategy which minimizes risk and general emotional connection with how your portfolio is doing on a daily basis. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But I&amp;amp;#39;m waiting. I have my buy orders set at $22k (around 65% down from ATH) and all the way down to $11k (a bit over 80% down). Once it hits those levels I&amp;amp;#39;ll continue to DCA, and after a month or two, start to buy alts (solid projects, no shitcoins), also DCA. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Oh look. How about Luna? Tera Luna has been the talk of town lately. The future of coins. And what’s that? They have a stable coin backed by bitcoin. Well then, it’s a no brainer. All of the smart folks are surely putting their money in UST. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Now fast forward one year..... Many of the big crypto are at or lower than the prices they were a year ago, we never hit $100k BTC, and people are back to the same old &amp;amp;quot;Buy now or you&amp;amp;#39;ll regret it later&amp;amp;quot; posts. In short, nobody here actually knows what they&amp;amp;#39;re talking about.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;People telling you to buy now or you&amp;amp;#39;ll regret it later are essentially just telling you to FOMO in. 100% of the people saying it have likely just FOMOed in themselves, and now want you to FOMO in as well to increase their investment. Don&amp;amp;#39;t listen to people here. Stick to your own investment plan and ignore the calls to FOMO in now from strangers on Reddit. Prices may very well go back up quickly and you missed your chance to buy cheap crypto, but they could just as well keep falling below the next support and you&amp;amp;#39;ve just FOMOed into comparatively expensive crypto. Have your own investment plan and stick to it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;TL;DR:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; The people here don&amp;amp;#39;t know anything. They just pretend they do. Have your own investment plan and stick to it. Ignore the people telling you to FOMO in on Reddit.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

People may seem negative about crypto now, but I think most of us would agree that we are still bullish on crypto in general for the mid to long term future.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While this is not the worst time to buy, there will probably be a years long period relatively soon where the sentiment around crypto is that it is dead and will legitimately never recover.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It wont just be normal people saying this, that will be the sentiment on this sub for many as well. You yourself will start to wonder if crypto can recover, and will probably start to think that crypto could actually just be dead. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As strange as it may seem now, it will be really really difficult to convince yourself to buy at that point. While the prices will be incredibly low, the overall sentiment will be that crypto will never see ATH ever again, and you won&amp;amp;#39;t want to buy.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That will be the best time to buy, as it has been in the past, and we aren’t close to that point yet. We still have many more months, maybe even a year or more before that point. A good barometer for the bottom will be when you yourself start to think that crypto could be dead and will not recover. Those who have the conviction to buy at that point will make out the best in the next bull run, just like they have in the past.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I remember seeing a lot of people suggest the next best stablecoin to invest in was the UST because of anchor and 19.5% apy. I know a lot of people that ended up switching over to this since it seemed the new best thing. Not even 2 weeks later this disaster happens and a stablecoin drops 30% with fears it won&amp;amp;#39;t be able to re-peg back to $1.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It must suck getting screwed over by cdc then going to anchor only to get screwed again 2 weeks later. My condolences 🙏 to you all. I know I almost was going to move my stablecoin stack over but knew 19.5% was not sustainable for long if everywhere was slashing rates so decided against it and just went to voyager and kept it in USDC. I didn&amp;amp;#39;t expect udt to go the way it did, let alone this quickly&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At this point it&amp;amp;#39;s a question of - &amp;amp;quot;will the bleeding stop&amp;amp;quot; or will UST/Terra Rug itself out of existence?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Two months ago &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/u/cwm9&quot;&amp;gt;/u/cwm9&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; made a very detailed post about his concerns with UST. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/tbcrkh/explain_to_me_how_terraluna_is_not_a_scam/?context=3&quot;&amp;gt;Which outlined a scenario exactly like this.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But go the other way: when people start selling their UST because they want to go back to bitcoin, they mint Luna and sell it. Now the price of Luna goes down. The fact that the price is going down and total coins minted is rising encourages the selling of Luna making the price drop farther. If the price drops too far, it can no longer support the burning of UST to get a dollar by selling Luna.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The response from Reddit was - well yah that&amp;amp;#39;s supply/demand + Terra is a lot more than UST there is a whole ecosystem.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Additionally Terra began buying BTC reserves and had over $1B in reserves to prepare for this scenario.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At this point the question isn&amp;amp;#39;t will the peg break? The BTC reserves of $1B are likely all gone and nothing is probably left. Nearly 3B in volume in the last 24 hours. The question is, is this the end of Terra?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
