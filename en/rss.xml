&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Everything in the crypto market is propped up by this shady stablecoin, yes even Btc. I think if it somehow collapsed then all things considered, we maybe actually have a scenario where crypto very briefly hits pre 2017-2018 bull market prices.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In that sense it would truly be a once in a lifetime to get many alts like Eth, Monero and perhaps even super cheap Btc. Since Btc has pretty much taken a Olympic swimming pool sized dump and the market along with it, thought I&amp;amp;#39;d try to speculate a bit positively, well sorta.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you look at all the charts for past bull runs followed by the bear market you&amp;amp;#39;ll see the coin shoot up 10-20-100x in a matter of months. This is in fact manipulation and not &amp;amp;quot;retail fomoing in&amp;amp;quot;. Then it slowly bleeds for 3-4 years. The reason for this is so that when whales want to sell off they will have plenty of liquidity for their price target, say about 30%-50% of that ATH. They need retail to buy their bags that they slowly sell off, while retail says &amp;amp;quot;buy the dip, omg 50% off, you begged for these prices, etc...&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This false idea that retail is getting a good deal psychological hurts them since they will keep buying&amp;amp;quot;high&amp;amp;quot; which just leads to more losses. But then the price will drop more leading them to question how can this coin drop another 50% from where i bought, it already dropped 75%, something must be wrong with this coin, I should sell, which further drops the price and affects those other dip buyers. However, they failed to look at the price of the coin 2 years ago which was probably $0.005 and now they are buying at $0.10 from a top of $0.80 but they think this is a good deal, when in fact the coin will bottom at like $0.02. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Right now the sentiment is, keep buying, this is a steal, you&amp;amp;#39;ll be so happy you bought now, but the most likely outcome is coins are now still in the zone for whales to keep dumping. They need you BUYING for liquidity and then after that it&amp;amp;#39;s just gonna stay flat, then people will lose interest and it will keep dropping. You have to remember us shrimp barely affect these $B mcap coins, whales run the show, and now they are cashing out on us. They are not buying, they are selling.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In a price perspective to evaluate a good deal, look at the price of the coin a couple years ago to its low, then its new ATH and see where is can sorta fall in the middle. For example ETH bottomed at ~$90 during the covid crash, then topped at $~5k. So right now people are saying $1400 is a great deal. Well $1400 is still very high from that last bottom but not that far down from the top. So a good deal relative to all prices is around $500-$700.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So remember look at both the coins ATH &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;and&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; its previous low to figure out if its a good buying opportunity. If you look at just the ATH its most likely a manipulated ATH price and the discount you&amp;amp;#39;re seeing is an illusion.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Due to extreme market conditions, today we are announcing that Celsius is pausing all withdrawals, Swap, and transfers between accounts. We are taking this action today to put Celsius in a better position to honor, over time, its withdrawal obligations. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Acting in the interest of our community is our top priority. In service of that commitment and to adhere to our risk management framework, we have activated a clause in our Terms of Use that will allow for this process to take place. Celsius has valuable assets and we are working diligently to meet our obligations. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We are taking this necessary action for the benefit of our entire community in order to stabilize liquidity and operations while we take steps to preserve and protect assets. Furthermore, customers will continue to accrue rewards during the pause in line with our commitment to our customers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We understand that this news is difficult, but we believe that our decision to pause withdrawals, Swap, and transfers between accounts is the most responsible action we can take to protect our community. We are working with a singular focus: to protect and preserve assets to meet our obligations to customers. Our ultimate objective is stabilizing liquidity and restoring withdrawals, Swap, and transfers between accounts as quickly as possible. There is a lot of work ahead as we consider various options, this process will take time, and there may be delays.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We thank the incredible Celsius community for your support today. It is our pleasure to serve you. Our operations continue and we will continue to share information with the community as it becomes available. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Where are those people now? Well they are probably too scared right now and the majority likely already left the market in January of this year or so. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s easy to call for a 80% dip but it&amp;amp;#39;s hard to stay for it. The dip won&amp;amp;#39;t be sharp down on one day and sharp up the next one. For most altcoins it will be a question of survival.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Don't hurt yourself for mindlessly…]]></description><link>https://crypto.buzzing.cc/en/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/vahq9u/no_this_is_not_the_perfect_time_to_buy_dont_catch/?score=762&amp;original_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2FCryptoCurrency%2Fcomments%2Fvahq9u%2Fno_this_is_not_the_perfect_time_to_buy_dont_catch%2F&amp;discuss_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2FCryptoCurrency%2Fcomments%2Fvahq9u%2Fno_this_is_not_the_perfect_time_to_buy_dont_catch%2F&amp;channel=CryptoCurrency&amp;sensitive=false</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://crypto.buzzing.cc/en/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/vahq9u/no_this_is_not_the_perfect_time_to_buy_dont_catch/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jun 2022 15:40:57 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&amp;lt;!-- SC_OFF --&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Beware of people saying this is the&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;perfect time to buy.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; In hindsight it is a very good advice if it goes back up and 10x the price, but at this point in time where there is real uncertainty in the market this is one of the worse advice you&amp;amp;#39;ll hear here. Don&amp;amp;#39;t hurt yourself for mindlessly buying.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Of course everyone is just afraid they&amp;amp;#39;ll be a bag holder, so the initial reaction would be to save themselves, and how? By making other people buy to protect the prices. Well to be honest, this sub can&amp;amp;#39;t even push the prices up anyway  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This might even go downhill even further. It&amp;amp;#39;s a massive dump in a span of 3 days.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;BTC is down almost down 10%&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;ETH is down &amp;amp;gt;15%&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Most alts I&amp;amp;#39;m watchin are at least 10-20% down&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It could very well go down further. Don&amp;amp;#39;t catch falling knives. Just &amp;amp;quot;zooming out&amp;amp;quot; on the daily candles on the BTC chart, we&amp;amp;#39;re obviously in a downtrend for months now, you don&amp;amp;#39;t need to draw lines or use indicators to realize that.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Of course I could be wrong too and I would definitely happy to be proven wrong since I myself just made my regular DCA purchase yesterday, but at this time, this is the most reasonable advice I can think of.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Just follow your schedule if you&amp;amp;#39;re dca-ing. Buying in bulk now will just hurt your average.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This might as well a warning and note to myself cause I&amp;amp;#39;m damned tempted to buy some off of my schedule.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Of course, everyone knows the  best time for crypto is when we are in a bull run but that has its cons ( see above), but at least in these bear times the community is more quiet and focused on the real things behind crypto and not full of shitcoin advertising and promoting. This is the time to accumulate and DCA or whatever investment plan you have.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
