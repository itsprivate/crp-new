&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Today, he is sending all the left over balance from his wallets to CEX so that he can get as much money as possible. He just transferred 10 USDC, 3.98 AAVE ($200), 138 SUSHI, 0.1 YFI, 2.5 COMP ($75) and other actual &amp;amp;quot;dust&amp;amp;quot; to various centralised exchanges. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How a 20 BN fund imploded in a matter of days is a lesson for everyone who thinks they are too big to fail. Arrogance has no place in markets, often those with an arrogant streak are quickly shown their place by the markets. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There are many more such people in crypto who thought they are too big and nothing could happen to them. Their behaviours smack of arrogance and disrespect for others. All it takes is one mistake where their ego takes over, and results in blowing up of all their wealth.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Bitcoin has been through a laundry list of trials and tribulations.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The WikiLeaks debacle.
The Mt. Gox hack.
The 2013 bubble and crash.
Several hostile hard forks.
The 2017 bubble and crash from the IPO mania.
An IRS crackdown.
Political uncertainty and PR campaigns.
Bans imposed by countries.
The current bubble and crash from the NFT mania.
And again this year from the technology sector collapse.
Countless other things I&amp;amp;#39;m forgetting.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But a true recession is something Bitcoin has not yet faced. The &amp;amp;quot;smart money&amp;amp;quot; is dumping their risky investments, Cryptocurrency being one of the riskiest assets. Bitcoin is going to be politically and reputationally vulnerable for quite some time. We have no idea what&amp;amp;#39;s going to happen or how far down Bitcoin will go.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That being said, all these things are just another slew of trials and tribulations that will make Bitcoin even more resilient than it is now.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is history in the making.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The further you go down the rabbit hole, the more certain you become that BTC has the potential to change every facet of our current society and culture. The consequences of ingrained unquestioning of the monetary system has been all that we know. Repeated cycles of boom and bust whereas each bust is a bit worst than the previous one. Crisis after crisis, we find a way to generate more credit and kickstart the boom cycle to avoid short term pain and systemic collapse. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We have existed only knowing an inflationary way of doing things. More credit, more consumption, and more capital that constantly loses its purchasing power are all supposedly the signs of a healthy economy? How come we assume as truth that a 2% inflation target is what a healthy economy needs? Are we really that confident deflationary capital that incentivizes us to save rather than spend, would surely be the downfall of our global economy? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We cant conceive of a deflationary reality because we assume that monetary technology and systems never can or will change. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Modern economics has neglected the very fabric of the system in which it attempts to model and predict. This is akin to a marine biologist studying all the different ways in which fish interact and behave while never even for a fucking second asking what is water. The degenerate economist will never question money itself, it will only ever question the ways in which we distribute and allocate that money. Couldn&amp;amp;#39;t the nature of the money be the problem? Could this nature dictate how we deal with policy and economic issues in ways we are not even fully conscious of?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What if money had no centralized entity that could arbitrarily decide supply, or if there was no centralized authority deciding who gets a loan and who does not?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;BTC does not care if you are black, white, woman, man, republican, democrat, liberal, conservative. BTC represents a different future. I am still unsure of the outcome, but it must surely be better than this slow decay. Why not at least try to operate differently? Let us return to human creativity and ingenuity to propel us forward. We are explorers by nature and this pursuit is too critical to not adventure in. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What we are currently in is late stage fiat degenerate capitalism. What if there was a pure form of capitalism whereas it merely served as a stage for ideas to flourish and compete with one another? Without the pressures and incentives of profit but with the incentives of aesthetics and creation? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What if there was a way to buy more time so we as humans can focus on these ventures? What if the money we held, grew in value, and not diminished in value? Coupling this capital with the natural deflationary pressures of technological advancement could certainly propel us to a new age no? An age characterized by having more time and less things. An age characterized by incentivizing long term value creation as opposed to short term gain. Those willing to take risk and be capitalists would be able to do so without fucking someone over that chose not to take that risk. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you go deep enough, you seize to be political because left and right become the same. Each side appealing to their respective pathos while ignoring the underlying systemic issue. Frank Zappa said it best: Politicians are the entertainment division of industry. When industry is placed in a system that incentivizes short time horizons and an inflationary spirit, industry and thereby its politicians will advocate for short term relief (either through social program spending or through less spending and less taxes). &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;BTC has the potential to restructure our power dynamics and greatly equalize the playing field. Will there be early winners (mostly us who &amp;amp;quot;invested&amp;amp;quot; in this)? Sure. But could this greatly benefit humanity in ways we cant even conceive of yet? Yes. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sorry for the rambling thoughts. BTC is more than a speculative vehicle. It represents a tiny glimmer of hope in a very fucked up world&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Finblox was backed by large VCs like Sequoia and Dragonfly. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In a message to users, Finblox has informed them they are reducing withdrawal limits and cutting all rewards. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/7pmmv1kavz591.jpg?width=777&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=3633179ec302914d1c0508065c81e604e38853ff&quot;&amp;gt;Finfblox: Withdrawals capped, rewards paused&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Finblox claims to have insurance for its funds - not sure if its going to pay out at all. In the present situation, VCs coming to any startup rescue is pretty much off the table.. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Its not clear which other operators are affected with the ongoing situation, one thing is certain - the contagion is deep and spreading quickly. 3AC was quite a big player who had commitments across multiple exchanges, lending services and market makers. Some trading desks have already sounded the alarm and have called back their margin. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Centralised entities continue to be very risky as of now.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

It seems like a rehash of the 100k predictions but in the opposite direction.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Everywhere I read on this sub people are throwing out random low ball numbers based off feeling rather than data - and people who do cite their predictions based off “inflation is the highest it’s been since 1981 and a recession is coming” I guarantee haven’t actually looked back at what happened in 1981.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also people saying the bottoms not in because the suicide hotline hasn’t been posted yet. Did you not see the Luna subreddit, or people talking about their Cro stake?!
Just because it’s not here right in front of your eyes it doesn’t mean it’s not there.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Obviously no one can pick the bottom, but there is a ton of data available to suggest where one might be.
You don’t bet on a horse based off feeling, you bet on it because you know it’s previous race history.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I also don’t think this “recession” is as bad as people expect it to be and this is rather a large correction in the wake of the last few years of green since the covid crash and all the money that was printed.
I believe the big one is still to come, but I feel we’ve still got one last big leg in before this happens.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I have formed this opinion from all the data I’ve trawled through, and I’ll explain why I think this is case below.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;————————————————————&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;First off from a pure macro data point BTC is right where it should bounce - or bloody close to it, if it is to follow previous market cycles.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A BTC bear market low has never broken the previous all time high. Previous ath was 19.8K&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In all previous bear markets the 200ma on the weekly has provided support and been a strong cycle bottom indicator (yes it has broken below down to the 300ma once or twice but this has always come with a very quick recovery).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The weekly RSI is the lowest it’s ever been of any bear market, which indicates BTC is the most over sold it’s ever been in its history.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;BTC rainbow chat is now in the dark blue.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The fair value indicator has diverged massively with fair value now at 41.5K. Divergences this large at almost double the current price have strong bottom signal. Last bear market the largest divergence was half and this was right on the bottom.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Stock to flow - I know some people don’t follow this chart after the 100K predictions but it still provides valuable data if you take it with a grain of salt and account for diminishing returns.
The chart is now bright green, previous market cycles have bottomed when this has occurred.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;BTC has hit the second lower logarithmic regression band. There’s still one more lower band at the 16K, but taking into consideration diminishing returns &amp;amp;amp; diminishing losses, the lowest band should not be touched just as the highest band was not touched at peak 2 years prior.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fear and greed is the second lowest it’s ever been.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Finally on the weekly candle charts in logarithmic we have a rising trend line since 2013 that has never been broken.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There is still plenty more data suggesting this is the bottom but these are just a few of the main ones I have picked out.
Obviously there is no way to predict a black swan event, but the only one I can reference in crypto is the covid crash and this still didn’t break macro data.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;———————————————————&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Moving onto why I believe we still have one more large leg up before a recession.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A lot of people are citing inflation and interest rate hikes to be the catalyst of this recession. Inflation is the highest it’s been since 1981, and in 1981 people were claiming the same thing but what followed was quite different.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To have an idea of what might happen, you have to look at what has happened. History always has a funny way of repeating itself.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In 1981 inflation was very high, the stock market dumped, Iraq invades Iran and President Reagan was shot in an assassination attempt. But what followed was a parabolic rally till 1987 after inflation got under control, then a major global recession hit.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Today inflation is the same as 81, the stock market has plummeted, Russia invaded Ukraine., and all we need now is an assassination attempt.. on hopefully an old Soviet era dick of a leader 👀&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As long as inflation gets under control, which I’m sure is in the Fed’s best interest, a scenario like 1981-87 can very well happen again.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My belief is a major recession will come in 2027-29 for a few reasons;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;1.Unemployment is at an all time low, at least here in NZ. A lot of other western countries are also low.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Many large companies are posting their largest profits ever.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The banks have been extremely cautious with lending since the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis, so the average joe is not going to suddenly default on their debts.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The world is moving on from covid and supply chains are all starting to free up again.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Finally,
When we have large recessions that hit hard it’s because property gets effected too. And currently the property market doesn’t look like it’s going to crash anytime soon due to low unemployment, secure lending, landlords earning more on rent and housing still selling for record highs.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The property market is one of the oldest in the world and it’s what the most people have exposure to.
Mum dad and the kids don’t have stock portfolios, but they do have a mortgage or rent, and a majority of people are in this same boat. So that’s why when the property market crashes, everyone feels it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And an interesting thing to note, just like stocks or any other market, the property market cycles too. Being a slower moving, larger market, cycles take a lot longer - about 18.5 years on average if you look at history, which would put the next big crash at 2027-28.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;19 years ago was the 2008 recession.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;20 years before that was 1987 financial crisis.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;18 years before that was 1970, the early 70s a notorious period of economic stagnation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;17 years before that was 1954. The recession of the mid 50s&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;18 years before that was 1936, americas third worst recession of the 20th century.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;21 years before was 1914, WW1&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So in following this 18.5 year cycle 2022-23 is too early.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is all obviously macro data and price can fluctuate short term in markets, but in the bigger picture I truely believe the bottom is now/very soon for both the stock market and crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I’m aggressively buying now, and I’m not suggesting you do too. All I’m saying is take some time to look at the bigger picture, it might just change your life.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Thought I’d repost for those new to the scene who are interested. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Berkeley offers 4 courses on the subject, all free to access, 2 with certificates. Berkeley has been involved with blockchain a bit longer than MIT, and having taken the MIT Sloan course and Berkeley edX courses myself I can say that Berkeley is quite a bit more informative on the cryptocurrency and the technical side of things.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://blockchain.berkeley.edu/courses/&quot;&amp;gt;https://blockchain.berkeley.edu/courses/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;2 are courses are offered through edX that have optional paid certificates available.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;2 are courses they offer through University that have publicly accessible course materials on their decal page.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The first two are part of a larger EdX “ Professional Certificate in Blockchain Fundamentals”.  In includes both classes and a larger “Professional” certification for $178.  Each class is available independently with individual certifications for $99.  Both classes can be “audited” for free, giving you access to the educational materials: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/uc-berkeleyx-blockchain-fundamentals&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/uc-berkeleyx-blockchain-fundamentals&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The second is a couple of “student run” accredited classes on-campus with Berkley, but the educational materials are available for free for anyone.  Archives to multiple semesters available: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://blockchain.berkeley.edu/courses/archive/&quot;&amp;gt;https://blockchain.berkeley.edu/courses/archive/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;the tx was confirmed on the blockchain but crypto.com  never confirmed it, so after half an hour I receive a &amp;amp;quot;refund claim&amp;amp;quot; email from them, where I could take back my 80$. And here it comes the scumbags part. The Refund is 80$ - 25$ as per TRANSACTION COSTS, while ETH tx cost right now is no more than 5$. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After posting more than $3 billion of losses since its initial public offering in late July, Robinhood’s shares have plunged more than 80%, cutting its market capitalization to as low as $5.99 billion. The firm had $6.19 billion of cash and cash equivalents at the end of the first quarter. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

That maximum damage is still yet to come.  Nobody on this sub or anywhere else for that matter actually knows where the price will go.  If it&amp;amp;#39;s so obvious that bitcoin is going below 10k, why aren&amp;amp;#39;t you shorting it right now?  Why haven&amp;amp;#39;t you sold everything you have?  Why aren&amp;amp;#39;t the people who are far more knowledgeable, experienced and invested than you dumping since it&amp;amp;#39;s so obvious that BTC is going to 10k?  Seems like an easy way to profit, since it&amp;amp;#39;s so certain, right?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s not.  We could have already hit bottom.  Truth is, nobody knows.  Even if we aren&amp;amp;#39;t at the bottom yet, here&amp;amp;#39;s the fate of 99% of investors on this sub:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; BTC drops further.  &amp;amp;quot;This isn&amp;amp;#39;t maximum damage yet.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; BTC drops further.  You don&amp;amp;#39;t buy because you&amp;amp;#39;re too afraid that if you do, it will dip more.  You&amp;amp;#39;re afraid that it&amp;amp;#39;s not the bottom yet.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; BTC drops to staggering lows, everyone is panicking, articles doomsaying the end of crypto are published, the suicide hotline is pinned.  Looks damn close to the bottom.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; You don&amp;amp;#39;t buy, because now you&amp;amp;#39;re afraid this is the end of crypto as we know it.  The rug has been pulled, everything is going to zero.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Crypto rallies and begins surging in price.  It multiples in value several times before you can react.  &amp;amp;quot;It&amp;amp;#39;s just a dead cat bounce&amp;amp;quot; you think, or some other stupid shit like that.  So you continue to be afraid, and you don&amp;amp;#39;t buy.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Crypto is up 5-10x from the bottom and you FOMO in on the way up.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Institutions dump on you again.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

If the market suddenly rallies always ask yourself “has something fundamentally changed that would cause everyone to suddenly pile in here?”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The truth is that it will go lower until the inflation gets under control. I know is weird, the inflation should help crypto’s case not work against it but looking at the bigger picture will help understand the situation.    &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The FED at the moment is pumping the value of the USD by continuously raising interest rates and by that effect lowering the value of everything that is paired against the dollar. It’s not more complicated than that. Once inflation will be brought down to normal levels and the quantitive tightening will stop, then the other assets can catch a break and return to normal.    &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yes there is the option where they can’t control the inflation and people will lose faith in the dollar in which case everything will explode in value but honestly when one of the world’s biggest economy will go through hyperinflation, half of the other nations would be absolutely ruined. The Euro and GBP are burning to the ground at the moment and it’s making the USD more of a safe space than ever to have your money in.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So basically it’s a matter of economic stability more than Bitcoin’s price.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So many comments on these subs at the end of 2021 and early &amp;amp;#39;22 from so many people wishing they had got in at a lower price. Well here is your opportunity.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You&amp;amp;#39;ll see many comments such as &amp;amp;#39;Don&amp;amp;#39;t catch a falling knife&amp;amp;#39;, or &amp;amp;#39;It&amp;amp;#39;s still dropping, and could drop to $10k or $5k, so wait until then&amp;amp;#39;, &amp;amp;#39;Don&amp;amp;#39;t be a fool buying now&amp;amp;#39;, &amp;amp;#39;Take your losses and run&amp;amp;#39;, &amp;amp;#39;Come back in later&amp;amp;#39;, etc. However, purchase small amounts often (or stack free satoshis from sites now offering more as the price drops), ignore the noise &amp;amp;amp; FUD, and stick to your &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;long term&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; plan.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Will you regret buying small amounts often in 10 or 20 years time when you look back to this year and see how many sats you stashed up?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;If Bitcoin goes to zero, it&amp;amp;#39;s not the end of the world and shouldn&amp;amp;#39;t be the end of your investments (diversify), and don&amp;amp;#39;t invest money you can&amp;amp;#39;t afford to lose.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;If Bitcoin goes to $100k, $500k, or more in the next 10 years, you won&amp;amp;#39;t regret it, and obtaining one bitcoin/BTC will become only obtainable by millionaires.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Remember most of us didn&amp;amp;#39;t get in early, but that doesn&amp;amp;#39;t necessarily mean you have missed out.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Happy Down 69 from 69 day&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Obligatory &amp;amp;quot;I&amp;amp;#39;ve been in the space for a while and seen a few things.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;First and foremost, people are exiting out of Tether. This isn&amp;amp;#39;t a normal retail exit. When someone exchanges USDT for USDC, for example, on an exchange, that&amp;amp;#39;s not a real exit of USDT. The chart below shows that since May 2022, there have been billions of USDT being exited into cash. In May, the market cap of Tether (i.e., the total supply) sat at $83B. Today, it sits at $70B. So there is $13B tether liquidated from the market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/mfrr64jdup591.png?width=1916&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=bcd64df8e693ca65f126f3980b7f06911b5a2413&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/mfrr64jdup591.png?width=1916&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=bcd64df8e693ca65f126f3980b7f06911b5a2413&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The problem with this $13B liquidation though, originates at the source of this &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://assets.ctfassets.net/vyse88cgwfbl/4EtXPBkmEPDNbIHNajz9vQ/bb4766acfe36f5af0c4e54a2694c8a31/tether-march-31-2021-reserves-breakdown.pdf&quot;&amp;gt;report published by Tether&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, stating that only 2.94% of its reserves are in cash. The pie chart in that document is a bit misleading -- it says 3.87%, but it is 3.87% of the 75.85% category of &amp;amp;quot;Cash &amp;amp;amp; Cash Equivalents &amp;amp;amp; Other Short Term Deposits &amp;amp;amp; Commercial Paper.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That report was published on March 31, 2021. At that time, the market cap of Tether was ~$62B (see chart below). 2.94% of that is $1.8B. We can also play out a second scenario: assume the cash reserves grew in tandem with the market cap. If that&amp;amp;#39;s the case, then at $83B, $2.4B would be in cash reserve.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/vju5zl19wp591.png?width=1916&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=a8c87c7a90edb13490d92c16b74f56c3aa9dd5e1&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/vju5zl19wp591.png?width=1916&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=a8c87c7a90edb13490d92c16b74f56c3aa9dd5e1&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Regardless of whether we take the $1.8B or $2.4B as true, those are both peanuts compared to the $13B liquidated from Tether in the past month. In fact, the liquidations would be 5.3x to 7.1x more than what Tether has in supposed cash reserves. To be able to account for this liquidation with actual cash, Tether would need to have 16% of its reserve in cash. I doubt it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So in my opinion, I now assume that Tether is dry of its cash reserves. This is where things start to get sticky. We can categorize their holdings into three categories: liquid, short-term, and long-term:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Liquid is basically cash (2.94%). These are things Tether can reach for to cover the cash people are asking for when they exit from Tether immediately. As I just talked about, my assumption is they&amp;amp;#39;re out of this.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Short-term is stuff they can potentially liquidate quickly (potentially at a penalty, so the value is not 1:1 necessarily) if they really need to, in order to cover the cash people are still asking for after they run out of liquid. We assume that 72.9% of Tether&amp;amp;#39;s supply (78.85% - 2.94%) can be categorized as this although &amp;amp;quot;short-term&amp;amp;quot; in this case is really subjective. Out of this 72.9%, I assume that USDT has already dipped into ~13% (16% - 2.94%). So approximately 60% is left over.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Long-term is everything else: 24.15% (100% - 75.85%). These are things that just can&amp;amp;#39;t really be liquidated easily except at extreme penalty. Also to note, out of the 24.15% we can safely assume the &amp;amp;quot;other investments&amp;amp;quot; category of 1.64% is probably useless and less than 1.64% now because 1) it includes investments in crypto, and 2) the crypto market has crashed. These could be illiquid investments into projects that don&amp;amp;#39;t have tokens on the secondary market yet, or they could be other cryptoassets, which probably will come at a significant premium if liquidated quickly (we don&amp;amp;#39;t know how much of these investments are liquid or illiquid, but either way we can say that it&amp;amp;#39;s fairly useless in this market). If Tether needs to tap into the long-term category, it&amp;amp;#39;s already pretty much game over.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And the name of the game is bank run. Bank run on an unsustainable model destroyed Luna/Terra, and bank run can destroy Tether as well. For those that don&amp;amp;#39;t know, a bank run happens when people all run to the bank to cash out at the same time. The bank doesn&amp;amp;#39;t have enough cash to give to everyone, which causes more panic and more people demanding to cash out. Ultimately, trust in the currency is lost, and people start cashing out at lower market value, tumbling the value of the currency into oblivion.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The bank run for Tether would begin as what looks like normal withdrawals, which can be covered by its liquid assets. This would be a 1:1 exchange. Based on my back-of-the-napkin math explained above, I believe the liquid assets are exhausted. Now Tether is tapping into its short-term assets. Some of these may come at a slight cost to liquidate (market volatility, penalties, etc.). This would not be a 1:1 exchange, so Tether needs to liquidate a bit extra to cover everyone who&amp;amp;#39;s asking for a dollar. I don&amp;amp;#39;t believe the short-term assets are all exhausted yet, so Tether can continue to carry this charade for a bit longer. In the event that people start to liquidate more USDT, then Tether will exhaust its short-term assets and have to tap into its long-term assets. If the flag hasn&amp;amp;#39;t been raised up to this point, it&amp;amp;#39;s certainly full mast now. The long-term assets are hard to immediately liquidate without penalties or market impact. Anyway, you see the picture.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With the cash reserve at Tether exhausted, I believe it marks the beginning of a potential bank run. In the recent 2018 crash, you can see that the confidence in Tether barely faltered (barely noticeable the amount being . In fact, the printing of Tether continues at a much more rapid pace moving forward. The market was still dependent on Tether.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/c7ost7ekzp591.png?width=1892&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=581de5fcaca690244273ec0426a8b702efc41792&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/c7ost7ekzp591.png?width=1892&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=581de5fcaca690244273ec0426a8b702efc41792&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But in May 2022, the severe liquidation of Tether began. That&amp;amp;#39;s the steep drop at the end of the blue line. With the crash of UST and the depegging of algorithmic stablecoins, I think the industry trust and sentiment towards stablecoins in general has faltered. And for good reason--taking a look at USDT, we can see that it has not recovered its peg to $1 since May 10 (see image below), which is right around the time that the major liquidations of USDT began.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/z16n8xhz1q591.png?width=1510&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=803bc5e6e4ae62405c313afe3992f08f92bd38b7&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/z16n8xhz1q591.png?width=1510&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=803bc5e6e4ae62405c313afe3992f08f92bd38b7&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The bear market in crypto, combined with all this news around big players like Luna/Terra, Celsius, and (potentially) 3AC collapsing, combined with all of the macro signals that indicate a recession (inflation, fed interest rate hikes, global war, food shortages, etc) are pushing people to get out of risky assets. As a result, we see the price of crypto dropping. And the circulation of USDT along with it. So people aren&amp;amp;#39;t just exiting cryptos into stablecoins; they&amp;amp;#39;re exiting USDT as well.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They are exiting USDT and either going into fiat or liquidating into other assets like USDC. You can see the chart for USDC market cap below, which started printing the same day that USDT collapsed, and has been growing in circulation ever since.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/vpe7uhap2q591.png?width=1518&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=c490b647446d1593ebe4d2870a51d94ca958e1bc&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/vpe7uhap2q591.png?width=1518&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=c490b647446d1593ebe4d2870a51d94ca958e1bc&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I think this is at least some indicator that people aren&amp;amp;#39;t just exiting crypto altogether, but also the trust and, ultimately, dependence, on USDT is waning. Following this current trajectory, I think there are a couple of scenarios that could result:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;USDT remains pegged to $1.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;USDT depegs from the dollar very quickly due to a bank run from lack of confidence in USDT. This would ultimately result in the collapse of USDT. This depeg would likely put significant stress on the market.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;USDT doesn&amp;amp;#39;t immediately depeg from the dollar, but dependence on USDT wanes, such that eventually once USDT does depeg, it doesn&amp;amp;#39;t affect the market very significantly.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And this is where my bias sets in. I don&amp;amp;#39;t wish harm or financial difficulty on anyone, and I mean no ill will to the Tether team. But I do hope that Tether also gets wiped during this crash. I think part of Tether&amp;amp;#39;s demise is already baked into the market, and evidence of this is demonstrated throughout this piece. On a more philosophical tone, Tether&amp;amp;#39;s demise is one that, I believe, is necessary for web3 to continue to grow in a healthy and sustainable manner. This market has been brutal to the unsustainable models, and I hope that Tether is no exception. It is a symbol of a broken system, and a collective delusion of the market that indicate that the market itself isn&amp;amp;#39;t ready to be taken seriously.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Massively up voted posts across reddit from people calling bitcoin a scam, saying that they&amp;amp;#39;re popping champagne watching people lose money. In what world are people that obsessed with an asset that they don&amp;amp;#39;t even own? Not to mention that the ENTIRE macro market is in a pullback right now, not just crypto. Yet you don&amp;amp;#39;t see gold, the s&amp;amp;amp;p 500 ect getting anywhere near this amount of shit, it&amp;amp;#39;s only crypto. I&amp;amp;#39;ll never understand it. You don&amp;amp;#39;t want to own it, don&amp;amp;#39;t own it. But who obsesses so much about an asset that doesn&amp;amp;#39;t affect their lives at all is beyond me.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I predict that once BTC falls below the 20k it will quickly drop down to at least 18k if not even lower and everything else will drop even harder.
I am looking for a good entry point but I guess we will have the whole year to &amp;amp;quot;buy the dip&amp;amp;quot; haha. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What do you guys think? How low will we crash before we see somewhat stable prices again?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
