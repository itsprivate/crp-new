Half these posts sound like they want to sell me a time share. Everyone should do what is best for them and not listen to others trying to protect their own stack. If those people actually cared they would be gleeful others are leaving so they could buy cheaper. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you need the money or are getting overly emotional then by all means cash out. Sometimes its better to have an unknown loss than live in anxiety. Next time just think carefully about your boundaries and where investing becomes gambling.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I think its important to use the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;3 Year Rule&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; in crypto. (to my knowledge) On every date Bitcoin has always been worth more than it was three years prior. Thus, if you cannot live without your funds for the next three years you are investing too much.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Disclaimer: &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Ya ne Russki, nu ya mogu govorite i chitat Russki yazik&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; (I&amp;amp;#39;m not Russian, but I can speak and read the Russian language). &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As usual the mass media have painted a dystopian picture of how the authoritarian Russian Federation have decided to ban crypto currencies full stop. Blah, blah.... it&amp;amp;#39;s China all over again, blah, blah.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Except that isn&amp;amp;#39;t what the report is proposing - and yes, it&amp;amp;#39;s only a proposal at this stage - an awfully long way from ever becoming law for multiple reasons. In Russia, government is not actually dictated by the Kremlin, contrary to popular Western perception. Here is what is actually being proposed:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A ban on the mining of cryptocurrencies on the territory of the Russian Federation. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A ban on Russian banks permitting their customers to buy, sell or trade cryptocurrencies.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A ban on crypto currency exchanges operating on the territory of the Russian Federation. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Most interestingly of all, the new proposals did not come from the Russian Central Bank (which did ban the use of cryptocurrency as a means of payment in 2020). These new proposals actually came from the FSB (The Federal Security Service), which has proposed:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#39;A complete ban of all cryptocurrency transactions in Russia, in order to undermine the financing of “foreign agent” media outlets, “undesirable” organizations, and the opposition.&amp;amp;#39;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Given the security situation in Western Russia (border with Ukraine), it&amp;amp;#39;s no great surprise that the FSB are currently influencing Russian government policy more so than typically. Yet it remains HIGHLY unlikely that these proposals will ever pass into law. Moreover we&amp;amp;#39;ve been here before:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-cenbank-bitcoin/russia-turns-cold-on-crypto-currencies-idUSKBN1CF0RF&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-cenbank-bitcoin/russia-turns-cold-on-crypto-currencies-idUSKBN1CF0RF&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Many commentators agree:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;John Wu, president of Ava Labs:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“Once again we’re seeing the crypto markets’ resilience to this kind of posturing. This is just the latest installment in a pattern of monetary authorities calling for a ban of crypto, and either seeing no further action or reversing their stance in the near future.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Indeed, the Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov recently stated that: “There is no sense in banning them, there is a need to regulate them&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then just yesterday, Elizaveta Danilova, the head of the Russian Central Bank&amp;amp;#39;s Financial Stability Department, publicly stated that &amp;amp;quot;Restrictions on owning cryptocurrencies are not envisaged&amp;amp;quot;. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So what we are seeing is typical of how government operates in Russia: the usual power struggle between the security services and central government. Right now the FSB does have the upper hand, but that will only remain so as long as the threat of war with Ukraine is present.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Today it hurts, I won&amp;amp;#39;t lie. Months and months of unrealized profits, poof, gone. We can spend all day moping around, but it won&amp;amp;#39;t get us anywhere. Nothing has changed our investment thesis: crypto will improve our world, so in the long run, we&amp;amp;#39;ll be rewarded.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I feel like chasing the gloomy sub mood, so here are five reasons to stay bullish for the long term.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;1-Several hundreds millions of people hold &amp;amp;amp; use crypto worldwide&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s hard to get an accurate estimate, but the best source I could find states that there is &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://triple-a.io/crypto-ownership/&quot;&amp;gt;at least 300 million people holding crypto in the world&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. We definitely got mainstream last year, and the sheer amount of users makes it unlikely everything will go to zero anytime soon.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;2-Energy consumption of crypto will go down a lot, very soon&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This week, US Congress is holding hearings about the energy consumption of cryptocurrencies. People are concerned about this, but here&amp;amp;#39;s the thing : the second biggest coin out there by market cap, ETH, will switch off proof-of-work forever &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://ethblogging.wordpress.com/2021/12/24/eth-merge-eth-2-0-upgrade-will-be-renamed-to-bellatrix-hard-fork-eth-to-the-stars-and-beyond/&quot;&amp;gt;in six months&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. This will cut down it&amp;amp;#39;s energy consumption by about 99% - and the same goes for every ERC-20 tokens and every ERC-721 NFTs out there.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;3-Usecases are becoming more and more apparent&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Unbanked people in Argentina are using the Binance Smart Chain to accept payments. Major credit cards companies such as Visa and MasterCard are launching crypto products. Web3 social media is rising fast - same for P2E blockchain-based games. ENS domains are becoming a thing. The list goes on and on.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;2-Institutions are getting onboard&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While it may take a while, pension funds, hedge funds and state-sponsored sovereign funds are getting interested in crypto. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/lawrencewintermeyer/2021/08/12/institutional-money-is-pouring-into-the-crypto-market-and-its-only-going-to-grow/?sh=4b3f69114598&quot;&amp;gt;About 7 out of 10 institutional investors&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; recently surveyed by Forbes planned to buy and hold crypto. Medium-term, this will make our assets less volatile, with blue-chips such as ETH and BTC beeing seen as &amp;amp;quot;internet bonds&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;1-The most brillant minds are getting into crypto&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The crypto job market is in a frenzy. Developers are leaving web giants to go work for CEXs, L2 solutions, fintechs, etc. An Ethereum developer can get $300k/year nowadays. Cryptography research is going very well, and concepts such as zero-knowledge proof are already being used in protocols. For those &amp;amp;quot;in it for the tech&amp;amp;quot;, the future looks bright.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We will make it, my friends!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That&amp;amp;#39;s when I made the worst mistake of my life, I Listened to people on &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/CryptoCurrency&quot;&amp;gt;r/CryptoCurrency&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I put the phone down and looked around only to see the very thing I&amp;amp;#39;ve been hiding from my entire life, bills, debt, crippling depression, no social skills, the inability to relate to others and worst of all being poor.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Being poor sucks.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;I checked the mail and apparently I owe a lot of money to different companies for things like electricity and water.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;I looked at my real wallet and its even emptier than my crypto wallet.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;I screamed ALGO!!! at the store and people didn&amp;amp;#39;t applaud me or start saying &amp;amp;quot;if you go, I&amp;amp;#39;ll ALGO&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;I told the cashier that FIAT is poison and she should accept bitcoin but she just stared at me and told me not to worry about paying but that I wasn&amp;amp;#39;t allowed to return.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;after a difficult day I pulled out my Ace and said Moon&amp;amp;#39;s to $1.00 but was only met with stares.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;so the moral of the story is don&amp;amp;#39;t listen to people on this sub, the real world sucks and they don&amp;amp;#39;t even have gifs.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TLDR: its not all sunshine and rainbows out in the world, so keep looking at the charts and shitposting.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Bear markets at least are good for getting your life back and stop being agitated or excited about your money, cause its down anyway lol.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With bitcoin going down to 30k we wont see any all time high soon, so we wont miss lifechanging money or crazy altcoin pumps, cause they wont happen.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So just make some coin alerts, for example i set btc for 30k and 50k and also for the other two coins i own, ETH and TRAC, and try to enjoy life, forget about your crypto and just stop looking at charts. nothing now will happen within 5 minutes or 1 hours that changes the sentiment.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cause overally, its a market problem, not a crypto problem. Crypto is doing fine, but there are so many red flags rooming, that the market is worried, and the market is an old beast, it moves slowly, so enjoy the spring and the summer, try to read up about crypto, follow the news once or twice a day but stop looking at charts. Your wife and kids will say thank you and you will have a better sleep.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Extreme fear is still prevalent in the market, and some people will still waste their day watching the Bitcoin price constantly.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you&amp;amp;#39;re in the Bitcoin world for the long haul, and you&amp;amp;#39;ve chosen to be a HODLer, you&amp;amp;#39;d better put the Bitcoin price aside and move on to something more productive.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Specifically, if you&amp;amp;#39;re not a trader, there&amp;amp;#39;s no point in putting yourself through this all day. The market is red, but the fundamentals of Bitcoin keep getting stronger.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The best thing to do is to continue to focus on the long term. Move on and get ready to have a relaxed weekend away from the price of Bitcoin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I won&amp;amp;#39;t be surprised if some people didn&amp;amp;#39;t take profits just for the fear of having &amp;amp;quot;Paper hands&amp;amp;quot;.
I can&amp;amp;#39;t vouch for other communities cause I just lurk around in this sub, and you will agree with me when I say that this community scorns those who even &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;think&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; of taking profits.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now, I can bet that a lot of people here regret not listening to their &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;own intelligence&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; and taking some sweet profits before the big red hit us all this year. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We chant &amp;amp;quot;Buy the dip&amp;amp;quot; everyday in this sub, hell even in the entire crypto world, but never have I heard someone say &amp;amp;quot;Sell the rally&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So here I am, giving you all a heads up for the inevitable crypto rally this year:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;It is OKAY to take some PROFITS !&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;It is OKAY to be able to sleep at night with no regrets.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;It is OKAY to miss some extra green because you didn&amp;amp;#39;t want to risk it.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Honestly, everyone who has been there in the crypto market books profit every now and then, they just keep it a secret. And all the newbies fall for the trap called &amp;amp;quot;HODL till death&amp;amp;quot;. Just don&amp;amp;#39;t do that. Hodl isn&amp;amp;#39;t some holy grail you need to abide by all the time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;DCA and HODL is definitely a very smart strategy to invest in good projects, but don&amp;amp;#39;t forget to get your family something nice with crypto profits. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In case you fear missing out on huge pumps, best hodl &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;some&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; while booking profits on a &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;small&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; percentage of your bag. This is a win-win situation where you minimize both risk and regrets while still HODLing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Lastly, If you have extra money, Buy the Dip fellas!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We all say we’re long term investing, but I don’t think people know what a long term investment means. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This means no matter what happens, YOU DO NOT SELL. Your scope is 5-10 years maybe even 3 but that’s what a long term investment is. You don’t just start selling at a loss at the first sight of trouble. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitcoin trends up with time. If you want to win you must HODL and buy more. These are the times when millionaires are made. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You will be rewarded for buying into fear. This is not hopium, this is a fact. Throughout history whenever markets have crashed, the ones that had money to buy the crash always came out on top. Nothing is lost until you sell.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As much as this sub preaches buy high sell low. Profits are taken at the top, not at the bottom. Bitcoin will survive and recover. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However the people who bought alts that have no purpose but hype at ATH’s are in for a rude awakening.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The inflation rate is now too much to ignore as the people realize that their buying power is deteriorating faster and faster with little being done about it. As money is harder to get with the Fed reducing its balance sheet, there will be less money to invest into Crypto and the market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;The Crash Has Already Started&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When the Fed announced it was going to be raising interest rates, I warned about a market crash in a post I made just 10 days ago. Unfortunately, the crash I was talking about has already started as the stock market has started going down very intensely. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/c1prsr60x0d81.png?width=843&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=0b0b9fcffc58081d9477139f54bf4334b97e94c3&quot;&amp;gt;Nasdaq Index Falling&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The pace at which the stock market is going down can very likely cause a situation like we&amp;amp;#39;ve seen in 2008. This is going to cause panic and sell offs among people. We can already see people cashing out their stock market gains due to recent price action.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Surging Inflation and Market Crash&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If we see the history, every time there was high inflation, the Fed artificially triggered a market crash by aggressively increasing interest rates.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/wd2srkb9x0d81.png?width=982&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=628ff4587a8298793996352607cec9b84c928f16&quot;&amp;gt;Inflation and Interest rate correlation&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This rise in interest rate and the planned decrease of the Fed&amp;amp;#39;s balance sheet is going to have a severe impact on the market as people start borrowing less, spending less and investments into all assets start to dwindle.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Biden Approval Rating&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/tbvvccadx0d81.png?width=1281&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e10b55e73781fccb335a8fb7f7203a709023a84b&quot;&amp;gt;Approval Ratings Fall Sharply Due To Inflation Concerns&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With more and more inflation, people are losing trust in the Government and the approval rating is going down. The main reason behind this huge fall in approval rating is inflation, and the government needs to tackle inflation if they want to keep their approval rating from falling even lower as the public takes notice of their bills. The approval rating is a sign that the government needs to do tackle inflation if it wants to keep public support.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;The Sell-off and the Opportunity&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With the market crash ahead being very likely, people are taking their money out faster and faster. The Fed is no longer giving them free money very soon. The amount of people that are buying assets very low considering the current situation, and it is likely going to start going down as the interest rates are yet to be increased, which is when we will see the peak effects of the upcoming crash.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However, when crashes are at their peak, they leave most assets EXTREMELY undervalued. These are the times when you want to dump money into things like Crypto, which can rise extremely fast during a bullish market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Crypto&amp;amp;#39;s Correspondence With the Stock Market&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Cryptocurrency market is strongly correlated with the stock market, especially after more and more institutions have started to invest in Crypto. The Crypto market WILL react if there is a downtrend in the general economy. That is basically the reason we saw another dip in Crypto&amp;amp;#39;s prices today.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;TLDR&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;: The Fed will be tightening its monetary policies due to inflation and the stock market has started to crash. With the stock market starting to go down, we&amp;amp;#39;re already seeing the Crypto market react today, and unfortunately if the general market continues to dip, so will Crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As far as I remember, Bitcoin was thought to be the solution of the fact that institutions, wall street and big money control the financial world and the pennies of the simple people from the normal population. And it was more or less like this, in the first several years after the inception of Bitcoin. We saw so much price discovery, Bitcoin being volatile, because mere mortals like us were buying, hodling, selling, wondering how much the &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;real&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; price of this asset is. It was literally supply and demand, controlled only by the psychology and the individual decisions of every single one of us.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What do we see nowadays? We go to bed, we wake up and we see that Bitcoin is at -10% for no reason. Literally for no reason. Neither me or you have sold. We were just sleeping. What happens? Bitcoin is strongly tied to the trading algorithms of insitutions and they handle it the same way they handle stocks. If the stock market is supposed to move down, bitcoin and crypto in general follows instantly in a nanosecond. We are not in control anymore. It doesn&amp;amp;#39;t matter if we buy or sell.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;During the last few years, we welcomed institutional interest and we cheered. Now I realize that they have much more power than us and the situation is the same as it has ever been - big money controls the pennies, or in this case the satoshis, of us - the simple people.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It makes me sad, but in the end, this is an open and free market. Everybody has the right to buy, sell or hold as much as he or she wants. In this case, it just happens so that the big players choose to be massively invested in crypto, which gives us the spot on the sidelines - sit and observe how the price fluctuates, without being able to react on our own.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;EDIT: I agree with a lot of you guys and girls. The same way sometimes we go to bed, wake up and see that Bitcoin is +15%. In those green days, nobody complains about it. What concerns me in overall is how tied the price movement of crypto assets to the price movement traditional assets is. I am not sure if this is an issue to be concerned about. However, it&amp;amp;#39;s a fact and I feel the necessity to talk about it and discuss it&amp;amp;#39;s impact.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;OK the price is low right now, prices have been falling and the whole market is fearful. Some people much smarter than me would say that this the time to buy, because this is when people get rich. Buy when there is blood on the street. Be greedy when others are fearful. That&amp;amp;#39;s all good and well, but for the rest of us that are fully invested - what the hell is happening?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;The Fed&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The US federal reserve recently announced that they will begin hiking interest rates and tapering their purchases of securities - why does this affect cryptocurrencies? The current economic environment was one of extraordinary monetary policy. The money printer was on full throttle and interest rates were at near zero for a huge amount of time. What was the cost of this? inflation. Now that inflation is up, the money printer has to be shut off, and interest rates have to be hiked. This is bad news for companies with a lot of debt (like tech stocks with high future growth priced in). So traders, hedge funds, retail investors start cutting trades, and taking profit. Also to fund their safer bets they need to sell riskier assets... it&amp;amp;#39;s a risk off environment. So risk is coming off, what is perceived as the riskiest asset out there? Cryptocurrencies. So we see trades unwind, as people panic. For context this is not just SCLP, or cryptocurrencies. At the time of writing NFLX is down 20%...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/0xv9rhv890d81.png?width=1326&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=123fcb75d5657b94cc30fbd290db5a83629f5753&quot;&amp;gt;Risk off&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The S&amp;amp;amp;P has broken out of a long term channel ..&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/rb7fw46e90d81.png?width=2754&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=0063b1a820fe2912fc41de401eb4b663ceb86f9c&quot;&amp;gt;Left chart is S&amp;amp;amp;P - which defines risk in the market, bitcoin is a much smaller market and so follows in its wake.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;So what should I do?&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Ask yourself a few simple questions - what is my investment horizon? What is my long term view on cryptocurrencies, and my chosen projects?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You need to look for projects that are tangible. You need to look for projects that you believe in. If you are feeling a mental strain, perhaps this is your first foray into the crypto markets - I would suggest making sure your investments are not too much for you to mentally handle. If you feel you are too at risk, then rebalance into less risky assets. Buy some bonds, which will do well in the increased interest rate environment. Then take a walk, live your life. The markets are volatile, they go up and they go down, but fear won&amp;amp;#39;t control the market forever. Think about why you invested in the space in the first place and ask yourself, has anything changed?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;We are in this together&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You are not alone. We will profit together, and people will think that the journey there was so easy - but we have to suffer to get there, which is something that the everyday person doesn&amp;amp;#39;t get. The pain we had to face along the way. It&amp;amp;#39;s a tale as old as crypto. Stay strong!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;1. Feign ignorance.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Scenario: In a facetime call with your father and he asks you how &amp;amp;quot;that bitmoney of yours is doing&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Response: &amp;amp;quot;Bitmoney? Haha (fake laughter) you mean &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;bitcoin&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; dad. I was just joking about getting into it. What is it even?&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;2. Lie&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Scenario: Your mother texts you asking what you did with Grandpa&amp;amp;#39;s inheritance.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Response: &amp;amp;quot;Oh (stalling language to give you more time to assemble your thoughts), I put it into a high-yield savings account. Why? Will you be needing it in about 9-10 months time?&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;3. Redirect&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Scenario: You leave your desk for a cup of coffee and your co-worker shouts &amp;amp;quot;Hey! It&amp;amp;#39;s Mr. Funny-Money!&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Response: &amp;amp;quot;Hey! It&amp;amp;#39;s Mr. Give-his-wife-a-black-eye-so-she-leaves-with-the-kids!&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;4. Run&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Scenario: Your wife is asking what happened to the money for the trip to Italy you were saving up for anniversary.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Response: &amp;amp;quot;Hang on I need to take a piss (do not go to the bathroom, but instead leave the house and run to a neighboring city and register under a new identity)&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;5. Hide&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Scenario: Your brother-in-law has tracked you down under your new identity of &amp;amp;quot;Janice Maria Juan Hernandez&amp;amp;quot; a trans-sexual erotic dancer, and phones you on your cell-phone.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Response: Do not pick up.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;6. Gas-light&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Scenario: Your boss is concerned about you because she noticed you stopped talking about cryptocurrency even though you were raving all about it throughout 2021.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Response: &amp;amp;quot;What? You were the one telling me about it. Don&amp;amp;#39;t you remember &amp;amp;#39;HODL, HODL&amp;amp;#39; and &amp;amp;#39;to the moon!&amp;amp;#39;? You were saying it all the time! (surreptitiously place your &amp;amp;#39;No sell &amp;amp;#39;til LAMBO&amp;amp;#39; mug on her desk) Look! Remember parading this around last summer?&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;7. Talk sense&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Scenario: Some drunk walks up to you on the street and says &amp;amp;quot;Cryptocurrencies are a fucking fraud man! I put all my savings into them and lost everything!&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Response: &amp;amp;quot;Listen you degenerate urchin (clinch to deflect his attack), a bear market is a natural process of any economic environment (duck a punch). If you can&amp;amp;#39;t handle the bear and hold, you don&amp;amp;#39;t deserve the bull&amp;amp;#39;s gold (parry his knife with your child).&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;8. Admit that maybe you are over-leveraged and that ultimately your life is more important than money.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Scenario: The police are speaking to you over a loudspeaker as you stand on the rooftop of your 12 floor office building.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Response: &amp;amp;quot;I&amp;amp;#39;ll come down for a crunch wrap supreme, chicken quesadilla, loaded fries, and a case of beer. NO CILANTRO. I SWEAR I&amp;amp;#39;LL JUMP IF YOU SCREW THIS UP.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With these steps in mind, hopefully you can stall long enough until your portfolio recovers and you can face your friends/relatives/parole officers with a straight face again.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Like 5 minutes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So of course everyone who have invested more than they could afford to lose are uncertain what to do so expect to a lot of posts like, even though it keeps being said that you should only invest what wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t affect your financial situation if you lose.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There&amp;amp;#39;s a huge difference between losing 10k or $1000, so of course you&amp;amp;#39;d prefer losing less and not being affected by the crash, or possibly a bear market which won&amp;amp;#39;t recover for a long time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s also a great time to buy in my opinion, even though I&amp;amp;#39;m just speculating as everyone else and we might drop to 10k&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

With Bitcoin right at the $40k mark, this will be the last time in the foreseeable future you’ll be able to buy it this high a price. It’s time to go all-in and prove that you truly have diamond hands. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So what is my strategy-&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;1- early withdraw my 401k and invest it in BTC&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;2- get as many personal loans as I can and use those to buy ETH above $3k&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;3- go to the bank and get a reverse mortgage on my home &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With these 3 simple steps, I can set myself up to show that I have diamond hands and believe in crypto. It will lead to wife-changing money, as she will divorce me and I can focus purely on crypto. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I am also going to pressure my family and friends to invest blindly into crypto. If they can survive the next 3 years if a crypto winter, they will earn my respect. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Buy high, sell low. Not financial advice.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;TLDR: Bullish and interesting&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Question 1 from  Diana Degette to  Ari Juels&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Is there a way to do Proof of work without wasting energy or electronic waste?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He answers that there is no other way but there is always Proof of Stake (he shills it at every occasion)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Question 2 (same speakers)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Do people have incentives to go to the cheapest energy to mine?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yes but there is always proof of stake (Diana Degette shuts him saying they&amp;amp;#39;ll come to that later) &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Question 3  Diana Degette to  John Belizaire&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Why the energy consumption is a feature not a bug?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;=&amp;amp;gt; The energy consumption is here to protect the network and lock in the value. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Question 4 Diana Degette to  Steve Wright&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Sometimes Renewable are not the cheapest right?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yes&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Question 5 Diana Degette to  Brian P. Brooks&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;You mention that proof of work can&amp;amp;#39;t shift to proof of stake why?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The proof of work makes a big value compared to other industries per consumption of energy. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Proof of Stake poses problems of security because of the holders but proof of work is more resilient and more decentralized&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;____________________________________________________________________________&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;New Character arrives: David McKinley &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_McKinley&quot;&amp;gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_McKinley&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cries about the hearing being a distraction from real problems. Says that states without renewable are discriminated because of renewable. He is mainly ranting. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;He asks: could miners rely on renewable to Greg Zerzan&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Answer: Yes as long as it is cheap and as long as the US is a net exporter of energy. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;____________________________________________________________________&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Greg Zerzan speaks about data centers using also a lot of data. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Frank Pallone asks why the 0.5% of energy consumption is credible to Ari Juels&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Derived from Hashrate. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Frank Pallone asks Steve wright how can we make sure consumers don&amp;amp;#39;t pay more because of miners. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The dude lags hardcore and I can&amp;amp;#39;t get a grip of what the fuck he said. Seriously this is a US congress hearing and I have a better connection that this dude. (the congressman didn&amp;amp;#39;t understand too and asked for a written answer LMAO) &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Cathy McMorris asks of Zerzan how blockchain can empower the consumer?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He explains how it makes people control their data which undercuts Facebook, google and all other Big tech companies. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;McMorris explains how the job boom of blockchain is outpacing other industries and asks about the value from these jobs?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Zerzan explains how cryptos are the blood of the blockchain and that these experts are needed to make the cryptos and blockchain work. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Mc Morris asks Steve wright (the laggy boy) what are the negative impacts of crypto mining&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He says his community is scared by unregulated currencies and that they are skeptical about these technologies but doesn&amp;amp;#39;t answer the question. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;She explains how many assets exist and how the industry is growing and helping the world. She questions the sustainability. She explains that some leaders in the POW are trying their best to be green and to make big projects to develop a better power grid. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;She asks Brian P. Brooks What are the innovation in the future of the crypto mining?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Brooks explains how crypto is not about tax evasion or money laundering, he explains how bitcoin is the most decentralized crypto and that there is value in decentralization. He explains how companies in this space are starting to fight against the giant in tech. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;He says, decentralization is safer, fairer and the future.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;She asks John Bellzaire what are the exiled miners from China searching in the US ?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He explains that miners who have suffered from &amp;amp;#39;the great unplugging&amp;amp;#39; have been searching for a free market with a real ecosystem (insurance companies etc) rule of law and are trying to thrive in the larger US economy. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Is very pro crypto, says he accepts crypto campaign donations. He wants to &amp;amp;#39;let the market decide&amp;amp;#39;. He says that they should help crypto to thrive instead of regulating it. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He asks Brooks &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;how halving will help miners who are more efficients and to be more energy efficient?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Brooks explains that these halving are seen as the next big rise in the crypto sector and are pushing progress in a lot of other sectors such as cooling industries. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;He asks Brooks how chips technology is benefiting from Bitcoin POW.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Brooks explains how they have pushed specialized chip tech forward and that they made leaps comparable to the tech leaps produced by the Space program. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;He asks brooks if miners in other countries are dirtier, isn&amp;amp;#39;t the solution to welcome them in the US?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Brooks answers yes. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Focuses on the old plants re-opened and how economics can push the miners to fossil fuels. (She seems very old)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Asks about that to Steve Wright:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He answers that as coal is less and less demanded due to regulation, the prices get lowers and some may be interested in these products. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Asks John Bellzaire about cleaner sources and says she is skeptical about crypto and about the fact that they use fossil fuel. (she is anti crypto I think but yay) &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;John Bellzaire answers that Crypto brings huge capital which help with the transformative of the grid and of the zero carbon footprint. The capital deployed in clean energy is currently virtualy infinite because of subsidies and of crypto capital. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;She says that they should hope Bellzaire&amp;amp;#39;s vision comes to fruition &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;__________________________________&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Morgan Griffith asks if Southwest Virginia could profit from the fact that it has cold temperatures to Brooks.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Brooks says yes. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;He then asks the same to other people who say all yes&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;He voices concern that congress should not regulate the crypto space out of existence and asks Brooks what he thinks about this.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Brooks answers that Bitcoin&amp;amp;#39;s value is not about the market cap of Bitcoin but about the transactions and about the fact that Bitcoin is the bedrock of the crypto ecosystem. So Bitcoin should be protected. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;He asks Zerzan if China ban on crypto shows an anti freedom stance.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Zerzan says that crypto is freedom and some people don&amp;amp;#39;t like freedom. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Says that a lot of miners are interested in the energy in New York. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Asks Bellzaire if it is possible to ban crypto miners from fossil fuel?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bellzaire explains that this could be feasible through carbon tax credits or financial incentives to develop flexible load environement. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And that they could also incentive Green energy producer to team up with miners. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;He then Asks Juels if consuming excess energy from renewable has opportunity cost&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Juels answers by saying that he needs to repair something that was said: Mining rigs are more efficient over time but it doesn&amp;amp;#39;t mean that the energy infused has been reduced. And doesn&amp;amp;#39;t answer. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The law maker ask again why he believes that this excess energy is wasted when used on POW?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Juels answers that &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;it is because proof of stake exist and that the concerns about the centralization of POS are very theoretical. For him it is not proven yet that the validators could break it. He says that this energy could go else where gives a very bad answer.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Asks to Brooks is it possible to reduce consumption with better equipment?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Brooks says that yes, in fact the energy efficiency of energy/ hash has improved dramatically and that the industries benefiting from Asic have gained a lot thanks to the funding in R&amp;amp;amp;D funding from miners. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Asks to Juels why he says that it is in fact not reducing consumption or being more efficient.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Juels explains that he doesn&amp;amp;#39;t measure energy consumption / hash but per transaction and in that sense Bitcoin is very energy intensive. He also says that the lightening network is not used a lot and in its infancy and remains to be seen how succesful it is. (lol talks about millions of people using it daily...) &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Asks to Bellzaire how his vision of flexibility translate in application.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bellzaire answers that these datacenters decentralized could help with algorithms and other problems not only POW but bringing valuable applications. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Asks Steve Wright how they managed cost of energy to help consumers while allowing mining.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He answers that they have bought reserves and made contracts with miners (I can&amp;amp;#39;t understand him well) &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The law maker kim schrier is saying: Do you think that despite the ransomware, the drug and human traffics, are crypto really bringing value to humanity? (what a moron)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Steve Wrights says it depends, and it depends on regulations, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;he wants a mechanism to be sure crypto is not used in the wrong way (decentralization is not about this).&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;She then asks him about a dam contract with canada which is totally unrelated.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Directly asks Brooks if the number of miners is important.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Brooks answers that it is not that important &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;at least less than in proof of stake&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; since POW can&amp;amp;#39;t be tricked and the lottery makes collusion impossible but &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;proof of stake allows for collusion and modification of blockchain.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;She Asks Juels about proof of stake consolidation and is it a real alternative to POW.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Juels says that the concern is not about POS or POW but about centralization and that POW is not better in that front. Juels says that the real concern is about the rich being richer but that most problems are unrelated to POS or POW. (He is cheerleading for POS) &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Asks juels what is the danger of centralization&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Juels explains that the problem would be an overtake of the blockchain and a control of the transactions. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Asks Wright the difference between datacenters and crypto mining as consumers of energy.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Wright answers that data centers were better prepared to approach the energy industry and that Bitcoin miners were unprepared&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The lawmaker asks what growth in jobs is made in these industries&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bellzaire answers that the jobs produced per energy is not known by him BUT that they are creating high value jobs such as data technicians and that the value is high. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;____________________________________________________________________________________&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Says that Crypto is very mystifying and that Crypto can be a future, a currency, a commodity, and a security. This committee is the first to have passed bills to establish these kind of definitions and also taxation rules. He wants to make sure that Crypto is not used by terrorist and wants way to claw back some of the money. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Says he is concerned with the energy use and how coal plants are re-opened because of Bitcoin. He says that, if crypto is the currency of the future, we can&amp;amp;#39;t destroy the planet to make it work. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Asks Juels how Data oracles can make blockchain more efficient?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Juels says that oracles are not making these more efficient it is not their role. He says that Smart Contracts are actually at the core of this. He says that blockchain are not connected to internet and that the oracle is the link between blockchain and offchain systems. &amp;amp;#39;the eyes and ears of smart contracts&amp;amp;#39; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Asks Brooks what the gov should do to encourage less energy intensive efforts?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Brooks answers that the market is the best answer, it depends on a lot of costs and Bitcoin is an energy derivative which can be used to understand the best role of energy at a current time. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Brooks also says that his companies are talking to wind farms and solar farms, not coal plants. The anecdotal stories of coal plants are not the reality. The vast majority of Bitcoin miners are providing a base load consumption to Green energy producers.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;____________________________________________________________________________________&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The thing concludes with Degette saying that they are happy with answers today and want to know how in the future if miners are located in the US how will the energy spending evolve. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;She says that the testimonies were of the utmost value today.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The idea behind this setting is to hide comment scores to reduce &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwagon_effect&quot;&amp;gt;the bandwagon effect&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.  That is to say, visible comment scores introduce cognitive bias:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Most people are more likely to think a comment is good or bad based on how others have already voted&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;There is also the reverse bandwagon effect where people will intentionally do the opposite of what the popular opinion is&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Sometimes users will think a comment&amp;amp;#39;s score is too high or low and use their vote to correct it.  For example thinking a comment with 200 upvotes is good but not great, so they downvote it even though they thought it was good&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This kind of bias negatively influences they quality of votes because it considers how everyone else voted instead of just the quality of the comment itself.  Currently this setting is set to 5 minutes, but I&amp;amp;#39;m proposing that it be increased to 60 minutes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some additional technical notes:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Comment sorting is unaffected&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, even though the specific scores are not visible&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Your own comment scores are still visible to you&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, this only affects seeing scores on comments by other users&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Comment scores are still visible to mods so work against vote manipulation is unaffected&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The time to hide scores can always be adjusted again in the future&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

No. A bear market is an ACTUAL financial term, with an actual definition.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;No. A bear market is an ACTUAL financial term, with an actual definition. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;a bear market has a very specific definition: when the market is down 20% &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;for at least a two-month period&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It does NOT matter if it hasn&amp;amp;#39;t dipped below the previous bottom, etc. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You&amp;amp;#39;ve all been deceived into thinking bear markets are bad. They&amp;amp;#39;re not. They&amp;amp;#39;re where accumulation happens. You can&amp;amp;#39;t properly DCA without dips.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: and for all of you saying &amp;amp;quot;Crypto is different!!!&amp;amp;quot;, would you have the same attitude if we were coming out of the bull market that got us to ~$1k? Why not? (So far no one has answered this lmfao. It&amp;amp;#39;s not different, quit deluding yourselves)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How anyone can believe a company with Facebook&amp;amp;#39;s track record of data mining wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t track EVERYTHING YOU DO IN THE METAVERSE? How can you have any faith in the &amp;amp;quot;meta coin&amp;amp;quot; when Zuckerberg has done nothing but worsen the human condition? The man literally just said meta will be tracking your facial expressions while using meta &amp;amp;quot;to better serve you&amp;amp;quot; ok I&amp;amp;#39;m sure. For god sake I just don&amp;amp;#39;t get it&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
