So not only are CDC untrustworthy, but they&amp;amp;#39;re now censoring (accurately) critical posts on their own sub:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/0s83zfynw8m81.png?width=1057&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=dfcfbdf7f17dd829bb9554f2e114b109d9b8e8eb&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/0s83zfynw8m81.png?width=1057&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=dfcfbdf7f17dd829bb9554f2e114b109d9b8e8eb&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Disclaimer: I’ve been a serious cheerleader for CDC for almost two years (check my post history). Until the past week, they could literally do no wrong in my eyes. But I’m starting to see that they are sneaky and becoming more untrustworthy by the day.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As per the title of this thread - Yes, you read that right. Forced Liquidations from your Spot Wallet. Yesterday CDC were happily handing out Crypto loans on their Exchange at a balmy 8% APY. Yet today, they decided they’d rather not – and gave any borrower 7 days to repay their loan(s).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;e.g. if someone had taken out a 10K loan last week (at 8%) and then placed it straight into Earn (USDC 14%) with a three-month stake, they would be absolutely fucked right now because of CDC&amp;amp;#39;s incompetent and ridiculous communication. 7 days to repay a loan that THEY were happy to make just 24 hours ago.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yes, most us know that they trading on leverage is a bad idea, but it seems many were happy to borrow at 8% and then stake in Earn at 14%. I’m the opposite luckily – USDC staked in Earn and (currently) no borrowing as the market is a mess right now.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I think it’s important that we draw as much attention to this as possible as ANY exchange which decides to treat loyal users in this way deserves to be called out and publicly shamed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto.com do a LOT of things right (Cards, Marketing, Sponsorships, Partnerships, PR, etc). But they are starting to seriously wrong foot users and making some very penny-pinching, illogical decisions which make them look shady as fuck.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;End of rant : ))&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Proof (+ it&amp;amp;#39;s all over the CDC sub)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My aunt is visiting, though, and she loves MSNBC so we&amp;amp;#39;ve had that on quite a bit for the past few days.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Liz Warren comes on this morning to talk about the war in Ukraine.  Then the topic turned to crypto and how Russia is using it to bypass sanctions, but...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;...literally EVERY point she made was either flawed or completely false.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How the heck is the crypto community going to achieve true mass adoption when we have people like her in positions of power who are inhibiting progress?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It reminds me of Andreas Antonopoulos mentioning years ago about how people were so against electricity at first because...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;or&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;WHY SHOULD WE CHANGE?  CANDLES AND OIL LAMPS WORK FINE!&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The mountain of naysayers just seems insurmountable right now.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Literally, on every site I use, just hordes of people just throwing FUD at it, and losing their stones in the situation trying to make the best of said situations and asking for their old fiat jobs back. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is just a meme, but it really shows what the market sentiment is all about right now. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/1jzu70z425m81.png?width=439&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=ecdac44307f488828101e3289e65750b349268e5&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/1jzu70z425m81.png?width=439&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=ecdac44307f488828101e3289e65750b349268e5&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here&amp;amp;#39;s a literal analysis, the bitcoin fear and greed index, and it just shows that the market is in extreme fear. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It seems like almost every &amp;amp;#39;I&amp;amp;#39;ll buy the next dip&amp;amp;#39; guy I know is completely out of the game where we stand. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I think most people don&amp;amp;#39;t understand the value of the bear market, and how necessary and crucial it is to making any kind of long-term profit. Some cryptocurrencies will break all-time highs, but some small projects might not make it. That&amp;amp;#39;s why it&amp;amp;#39;s vital to place yourself where it matters. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For the mean time, high-risk tokens might not be your best. Most people should right now focus on stablecoins and amassing a large portion of them as the major chunk of their portfolio. It&amp;amp;#39;s important to have fallback. Even during a bull market, you want to take profits in stablecoins. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/5kk6wws635m81.png?width=845&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=4f8acb4a5018a8b69803fb7b1665e9bb038be474&quot;&amp;gt;even 4chan is feeling the heat and getting a little spooked &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Go ahead and buy the dip&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You&amp;amp;#39;ve been literally beckoning it all bull market, so go ahead, do something about it, this is the bear market you have been waiting for. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But of course, there&amp;amp;#39;s more way than one to &amp;amp;#39;buy the dip&amp;amp;#39;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The strategy I like to make, during a bear like this one is, 50% stablecoins, 25% sure-fire bets, 20% second-tier tokens, 5% memecoins, and for this special bear I&amp;amp;#39;ve got, USDT and UST, ETH BTC and ADA of course, MATIC CHZ, and then for the memes I&amp;amp;#39;ve got some DOGE ELON SHIB ALICE and maybe babydoge though I&amp;amp;#39;m still iffy on that... &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Another good strategy, that I would literally advise to anyone, either veteran or just starting in the market is &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Dollar Cost Averaging,&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; and for most of you reading this you already know how it goes: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You set parameters of time and buy amount, and every recurring date you buy the same amount in stable in your accumulated coin. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This strategy always works because there&amp;amp;#39;s a lot of room for error. Even if you mistime the market or miss out, you can still make it next period. Every veteran trader I know would push for it, even the addicted day-traders who need instant actions. Because, it simply works. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Another good way you can run the market now, is by shorting the top performers, or in this case, the worst performers, and make gains off their losses. Shorting and longing is a game of leveraging and will put you in a tug-of-war between the bears and bulls and I would not advise it for anyone, especially for those just starting or those unable to attend to the market 24/7. The bear/bull war is nasty and violent, and it&amp;amp;#39;s stock-full of bear traps and bull long squeezes, it&amp;amp;#39;s not a game for those who want to trade retail or put their full pledged attention upon it. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the meantime, the bear market blesses you with one precious gift, a time-off. Let the market recover itself in itself, as it has always down, as it always will. There&amp;amp;#39;s little you can about it now, so you might as well just let it run its course and set to repair and ammend. Take this as a sign for vacation, and get some well-needed rest.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There are surely people on both sides, who could be considered victims of war, but if the financial industry can contribute to making more people victims, then that is wrong. Crypto should never be controlled by anyone. Blocking it, or attempting to block it, is not going to solve any political conflict. But keeping it available to anyone and everyone will still ensure people can trade when and what they need to, in order to survive.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The order will direct federal agencies to examine potential regulatory changes and the national security and economic impact of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, people familiar with the administration’s plans told &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Bloomberg&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“The executive order, which has been in the works since last year, will require federal agencies across the government to report later this year what they’re doing regarding digital tokens,” per the report. “The plan is expected to begin carving out roles for agencies across the government, from the State Department to the Commerce Department.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Regulatory efforts &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/biden-administration-to-regulate-bitcoin-as-a-matter-of-national-security-report&quot;&amp;gt;would also involve&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; the Treasury Department, National Economic Council, Council of Economic Advisers, and the White House National Security Council.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitcoin has risen to the spotlight since the U.S. and its allies began imposing restrictions on Russia in a push to isolate the country’s economy and suppress its abilities to continue marching forward in its Ukraine invasion. Despite being a &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/biden-imposes-sanctions-on-russia-bitcoin-jumps-to-39k&quot;&amp;gt;tangible alternative to Russian citizens&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; who may now find themselves unable to send and receive money freely, Bitcoin is &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.btcpolicy.org/blog/no-bitcoin-wont-save-russia-from-western-sanctions&quot;&amp;gt;likely unable&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; to equally help the nation bypass Western sanctions altogether.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However, U.S. lawmakers have expressed concerns regarding such a possibility, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, who &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2022.03.01%20Letter%20to%20Treasury%20re%20OFAC%20crypto%20sanctions%20enforcement.pdf&quot;&amp;gt;sent a letter&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; to the Treasury Department inquiring about its plans to combat an eventual Russian usage of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Since late 2021, NFTs have been on a steep downward trend. I decided to do some quick research after watching the general sentiment here on reddit turn from &amp;amp;quot;crazy optimistic&amp;amp;quot; to &amp;amp;quot;pariah.&amp;amp;quot; Sometimes, that&amp;amp;#39;s just &amp;amp;quot;group think,&amp;amp;quot; and the truth lies in the marketplace. In this case, what we&amp;amp;#39;re looking at is actual search demand. This would include searches by non-buyers who were just learning about the term for the first time, seeking greater understanding of the concept, yet rather than finding that info and jumping into the pool, the data would suggest that most are disinterested in further participation at that point. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My assessment of the cause could be open to interpretation. The data shows however, that NFTs are in no way gaining in popularity overall.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

In the book, we learn many things about the founders including some of their behaviors. One that I found more fascinating was Charles Hoskinson&amp;amp;#39;s given how drawn many are to him.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Having read the book, a twitter user calls out Laura for portraying Charles in a bad light. Hoskinson replies to the user that Laura&amp;amp;#39;s book is a , &amp;amp;quot; Great work of fiction. Tough market to beat George R.R. Martin and Tolkien, but we wish her well.&amp;amp;quot; She then replies with some receipts, showing that Charles hasn&amp;amp;#39;t been very honest regarding some of his claims such as his level of education. At this point, can we trust anything Charles has to say because time and again, he&amp;amp;#39;s shown to not be very reliable? There&amp;amp;#39;s nothing wrong with not having a degree; however, to lie or stretch the truth in such a space where people are looked upon as &amp;amp;quot;experts in their fields&amp;amp;quot; is appalling.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;People are also blaming the bear market that started in November and the war that started recently as the sole reason for the dip, even though the ADA price has been falling non-stop since September.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So far, I have not met a single person here that made an actual argument for ADAs long term value.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I would like to know what’s so special about it? I get that ETH is currently unbearable and its true that Cardano has Proof-of-Stake while ETH doesn&amp;amp;#39;t. But there are literally dozens of Proof-of-stake blockchains with working smart contracts and a blooming network of dApps.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Tezos, Harmony, Fantom, Juno, Algorand, Solana, BSC, Tron, Flow, Cronos, Secret Network, Oasis, Near, Klaytn, Celo, Avalanche, Moonbeam and many more are proof of stake and have tons of dApps. They all have their pros and cons, but every single one of them is much further in their development than Cardano. Some of them also seem more scalable for the long term like Harmony and Near.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So, what about Cardano is so promising? Why is everyone so sure that it will outperform all this other ETH competitors?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Inb4 all the FUD comments&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The sufficient volume activity on the seller’s side suggests the coin would soon visit the $36000 monthly support. If sellers breach this support level as well, the bitcoin traders can expect another 8.5% fall, retesting the January low at $33000.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
On a contrary note, if the shared support of $36000 and traditional pivot level bolster the buyers to regain control from the bears. Then, the coin price would surge higher to rechallenge the $45000 barrier. This formidable resistance is crucial for buyers to initiate a genuine recovery. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Resistance level- $40000, $45000&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Support level- $36000, $33000&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

Moreover, a bearish alignment among these EMAs indicates a bearish tendency.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The RSI indicator slope wavering above-below the neutral line accentuates a side-way rally in price action. However, the slope currently moving below the midline suggests the bears have the upper hand.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I heard the 100k by EOY and believed it. I didnt borrow money or invest anything I couldn&amp;amp;#39;t afford to lose, but I bought into it. I listened to too many people on twitter and YouTube yell &amp;amp;quot;TO THE MOOON&amp;amp;quot;. I get it. No one wants to hear realistic discussions. They only want to hear hopium.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But you have Saylor and Rao Paul, Plan B talking about BTC going to a million or 10 million. Then you have this demonization of selling. Paper hands bad. Diamond hands good. HODL HODL HODL!!!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You ever think the reason why is so they can buy and sell between 45k and 38k, make you hold so they can bounce the price up and down and get rich while we sit around and wait for them to let us make a little bread? Maybe they let us have 69k for a shot of hopium?? Idk man. It starts to shoot up and people fomo in so that rich dudes have someone to sell to.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They like crypto because of the low market cap and small supply when everyone holds. Low volume equals easy manipulation. They treat us like suckers...or maybe I just feel like one.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Am I overstating the obvious or completely wrong?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Nell reports via Twitter that as many as 25 apps and services will be terminated on April 3. These include the following crypto projects: Yearn Finance (YFI), Keep3r (KP3R), Multichain (MULTI), Chainlist (CLIST), Solidly (SOLID) and Bribe.crv.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/9y8k59l60ul81.png?width=602&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=95eb11b9084970afae84486f8f4eb25ae1f75237&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/9y8k59l60ul81.png?width=602&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=95eb11b9084970afae84486f8f4eb25ae1f75237&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Unlike previous &amp;amp;quot;building in defi sucks&amp;amp;quot; rage quits, this is not a knee jerk reaction to the hate received from releasing a project, but a decision that has been coming for a while now. Thanks you to everyone that supported us over the past few years.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thus Knell. The authenticity of the message was initially doubted, as Cronje no longer has a Twitter account. However, journalist Colin Wu reports that Cronje confirmed the news via LinkedIn. The tantrums Knell refers to are familiar to Cronje. He has threatened to resign before when things went wrong with some of his DeFi projects. Cronje had in fact launched DeFi projects a few times with the warning that they were not yet finished. Despite this, people put a lot of money into them that was then stolen when vulnerabilities were exploited by hackers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Major damage Fantom and co the result?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yet the community cries that &amp;amp;quot;terminated&amp;amp;quot; may be a misleading term. After all, not all projects are being shut down.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To contain further damage, a number of projects have already announced that Cronje was not the only developer working on this crypto. The Fantom Foundation reports that more than 40 people are working on the Fantom platform. Also &amp;amp;#39;Banteg&amp;amp;#39; from Yearn Finance says that as many as 50 developers are active.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However, this may not be true for all projects. Some apps, such as Bribe.crv, now have a welcome message on the website stating that the service will be discontinued on April 3. Also, damage control seems to be working only slightly; the prices of many of these crypto received heavy blows this morning.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For example, YFI is down 11%, FTM 16%, KP3R 27%, MULTI 19%, CLIST 7%, and SOLID a whopping 70%. Solidly, by the way, launched less than a week ago. The hefty declines seem to be pulling even the rest of the market along.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And you kind of just stutter for a hot second as like a million thoughts flood your mind - history of money - gold standard - Brettonwoods - fiat - computers - hashes - housing crash - mtgox - DeFi - miners - inflation - consensus mechanisms - market caps - bonds - yield - Merkel trees - SHA-256 - Could probably talk for hours about economic possibilities.        &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here are the easy answers:&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
1). Bitcoin is just a money sending system, like the VISA network, but it’s now owned by anyone, it’s open source software. Really good for instant settlements, you can trade it back to USD in one click, while banks take a few days.       &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;2) Bitcoin is like a digital dollar, but instead of the US government making more of it whenever they want, it’s made on orderly computers by anyone who runs the Bitcoin software. The more computers the more strength the network has. It goes up in price because people find its digital value more and more worthwhile.           &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;3) Bitcoin is just digital money. Thing is it wasn’t once not digital and made digital like the dollar was, it was designed on computers using advanced security software with its continued computational integrity in mind.                       &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Those are my best quick answers. How would you elevator pitch Bitcoin?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Yes, we are desperate and it is your doing. We are here risking for a win because we have no other choice. Because you fucked up bad.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Dear feds, there are more pressing matters than crypto, you fucked up earth and continue to do so. World is on the brink of war. We have tyrants taking out democracies and people&amp;amp;#39;s trust in you is at all time low. Leave us alone for once. Don&amp;amp;#39;t fuck this one up. We can take care of ourselves. It is our choice to make. Let us have this one thing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The only thing you need to do is &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;comment your Banano address&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; and you will receive some.

Setting up a wallet only takes a minute or so and wont cost you anything.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;What is Banano?&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Banano is an instant, fee-less and eco-friendly cryptocurrency founded in 2018 and probably inhabits the most friendly and funny community in all of crypto. In fact, this endorsement (or just call it a kind note) should tell you all you need to know:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/fgjskua97sl81.png?width=751&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=33b9485b4db1ca575c8382dffb44ec8bc1a867df&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/banano/comments/n9oz27/creator_of_dogecoin_here_was_told_to_check_this/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Importantly, Banano has been distributed entirely for free since April 1, 2018.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Banano has ongoing development since years and has experimented with hundreds of different ways of distribution since then, while keeping the onboarding of noobs and the education of users as a &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;priority&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. For example, we set up &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://bananominer.com/&quot;&amp;gt;Bananominer.com&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; which simply means we are rewarding users to contribute to Folding@Home with BAN - while Banano itself doesn’t require mining. This incentive to support medical research has led Banano into the top folding teams of all time! Stats can be found &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://stats.foldingathome.org/team&quot;&amp;gt;here&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;

Try out these &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/banano/comments/nyb4ch/faucet_list/&quot;&amp;gt;faucets&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and join our community (&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/banano/&quot;&amp;gt;Reddit&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.banano.cc/&quot;&amp;gt;Discord&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; being the most active channels), we have loads of different ways to get free BANANO all the time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also, in recent times we started to wrap Banano and bring wBAN to Binance Smart Chain, Polygon and since yesterday also to the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://fantom.banano.cc&quot;&amp;gt;Fantom network&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To better understand what Banano is, check out our &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://banano.cc&quot;&amp;gt;website&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;particularly our&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://banano.cc/yellowpaper&quot;&amp;gt;meme-rich Yellowpaper&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. For help getting started and relevant links check out &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://banano.how&quot;&amp;gt;banano.how&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;THANK YOU to &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/CC&quot;&amp;gt;r/CC&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; for letting us do this, and we&amp;amp;#39;ll see YOU in the Jungle!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
