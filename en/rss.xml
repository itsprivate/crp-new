- enjoy life
- ignore your portfolio for the coming years

Bear markets are the rare opportunity for wealth transfers, and are where crypto millionares are made. If you loaded up on $90 ETH and $4K BTC during the March 2020 dip, or either coin from 2019 til then, you&amp;amp;#39;d still be up a TON. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Buying $40K BTC to sell at $60K during a bull market really isn&amp;amp;#39;t going to change your life. Buying during the fear, panic and capitulation is. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I know its hard, but I&amp;amp;#39;d urge you to be calm and excited for a bear market. I doubt we will see an 80-90% dip off ATH, but I HOPE we do. I want to dispose of USD shitcoin and load up on limited supply, lower inflation coins like BTC/ETH, and I have been during this year. But sales and discounts allow you to 10x instead of 2x. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The only reason you should have fear, is if you need this money to pay bills in the next few months. But if you hodl for the long term, you should be very happy that we may have another wealth transfer market on the horizon; transferring wealth from those who can&amp;amp;#39;t afford to wait to those who can. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Good luck.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: Yo guys! Thanks for the responses, no matter showing criticism or support. I don&amp;amp;#39;t really know why people are comparing this situation to being in a toxic relationship, so I will provide another analogy for the quotes: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You have a partner who you have been together for years. Although financially, he/she might not be doing very good, but you know that he/she is TRYING! That&amp;amp;#39;s the main point, there&amp;amp;#39;ll be a great future if u guys stay together. Leaving your partner who is struggling and when they are down is bad...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So one more here, you&amp;amp;#39;re supporting a football club and you know, they can&amp;amp;#39;t win all the games. If you leave your club and go on supporting other clubs when your old club is in a bad form, then don&amp;amp;#39;t come back when they start winning because you simply don&amp;amp;#39;t like the club true heartedly.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I admit it doesn&amp;amp;#39;t feel good when bitcoin dips, but if u paper-handed, then u wont even have the chance to celebrate the highs. So why not have some hopium!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Edit2: many of you still don&amp;amp;#39;t understand what I&amp;amp;#39;m doing here, I&amp;amp;#39;ll try again: when I wrote the post, BTC was lower than a year before that, on January 10th, 2021. Yes, for example on July 21st, 2021 BTC went below 30k and was lower than now - but even at that point BTC was much higher than on July 21st, 2020 (a year earlier), when it was at 9k&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I got into crypto in late 2020. During that whole time, whether BTC was up or down in the past days or weeks, you could always &amp;amp;quot;zoom out&amp;amp;quot;, look at the prices a year ago and see that it was still up a ton compared to then.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For the first time since I got into crypto, this is not the case anymore. At the time I write this, BTC is down 1.5% compared to a year ago, compared to Coingecko. So I got curious: when was the last time BTC was down from a year earlier? So I got the data and looked into how BTC opening prices changed to a year earlier every day since 2013.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To answer the question: &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;September 14th, 2020,&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; when it was very closely below where it was a year earlier. The last time it was lower than a year earlier for more than a few scattered days was June to July 2020, the last time it was consistently down a lot compared to a year earlier for a long time was in early 2019. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/a/BfBfXWu&quot;&amp;gt;Here is the data for the past 3 years in an ugly graph&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, you can see it was up for the vast majority of the time and was more than 1,000% up in March 2021 compared to March 2020.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Widening the time frame, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/a/9BxCR52&quot;&amp;gt;here you can see the whole time frame I analyzed&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, and, not very surprisingly, BTC has also been up compared to a year earlier for the vast majority of the time as well.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some more fun facts:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;BTC was up 8,671% from a year earlier on November 30th, 2013&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;BTC was down 90% from a year earlier on January 16th, 2019&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;during the whole time frame, BTC was up compared to a year earlier for 2634 days and down for 627 days&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;the longest timeframe BTC was continuously up compared to a year earlier was from December 6th, 2015 to October 31st, 2018 (1,060 days)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;the longest timeframe BTC was continuously down compared to a year earlier was from November 16th, 2014 to November 2nd, 2015 (351 days)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sometimes individuals remind us that the whole purpose of cryptocurrencies is that a decentralized financial system allows us freedom and independence from a third party as we conduct our transactions.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But still crypto will never replace fiat fully.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto and Fiat will coexist.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fiat money has been used for longer and is accepted more globally then crypto, but crypto offers many advantages that fiat currencies do not have, especially when we talk about inflation and creating a fair financial system.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Unlike gold that has gold in it and silver that has silver in it ,fiat as paper has worthless paper in it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But the central government gives value to this paper and it exists only because the central government says that it has purchasing power.  Also, with the help of the central power, states preserve power, and thus peace with all manipulation that comes with it.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is precisely those states that will simply never hand over that power, but will jealously guard it, and whatever crypto does, fiat will historically still be there.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto will not replace Fiat, but with cryptocurrencies we get one strong alternative that we can use whenever we want, and banks will therefore have to change their business.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The way the stock market is booming right now is nothing more than abnormal. The S&amp;amp;amp;P500 alone is &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;100%&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; higher than what it was in March 2020 while actual productivity has shrunk with people leaving jobs faster than ever. Moreover, the housing market booming makes zero sense. Houses continue to skyrocket in value faster than the already high inflation rate can keep up.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Companies are also being overvalued by hundreds of times if you compare their profits to the stock market. If you look at Tesla, it is often the most used example of an overvalued company, and even then it pales to some of the most overvalued companies in the market right now.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Prof. Dr. Robert Shiller&amp;amp;#39;s Bubble Checklist Made in 2010.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;1. Sharp increases in the price of an asset like real estate or shares&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;☑&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;2. Great public excitement about said increases&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;   &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;☑&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;3. An accompanying media frenzy&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;☑&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;4. Stories of people earning much money, causing envy among people who are not&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;   &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;☑&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;5. Growing interest in asset class among the general public&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;☑&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;6. ”New era” theories to justify unprecedented price increases&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;   &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;☑&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;7. A decline in lending standards&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;   &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;☑&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;The Illusion of Prosperity&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Every hyperinflationary event is always followed by a fake illusion of prosperity. We&amp;amp;#39;ve seen this happen with the Weimar Republic, Venezuela, Zimbabwe and Lebanon. For example, in the months following hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic, people were becoming wealthier in the millions despite coming out of a war just months earlier. The market was doing so good that it was called the &amp;amp;quot;Golden Twenties&amp;amp;quot; in Germany.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However, as the hyperinflation got closer, &amp;amp;quot;The citizenry saw prices going up due to shortages — and as more currency was produced to pay ever-rising union wages — buying activity became a frenzy.&amp;amp;quot; This is very similar to the worker, logistics and countless other shortages we are facing today, this is not normal.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The interest rates of 0.25% by the Fed are also another indication of money supply being overstretched. The interest rates have been kept artificially low for way too long. Any country that has kept interest rates this low has always faced some kind of crash or economic crisis. The US can only do so for so long.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Be Prepared&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Recessions &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;are the inevitable result of the business cycle in a capitalist economy,&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; never believe people that say &amp;amp;quot;this time is different,&amp;amp;quot; and be prepared if things go south. Moreover, something even worse than all these indications is the debt level growing right before our eyes which is nearly $30 Trillion and growing exponentially. Moreover, the Nasdaq is already 8% down from it&amp;amp;#39;s ATH, while the S&amp;amp;amp;P500 is 4% down. Maybe the crash comes in a few months or even years.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The best thing you can do right now to protect yourself is to keep an emergency fund that can act as a hedge in the case of hyperinflation or a sudden crash such as Gold or staked Crypto. Always be prepared for the worst because the current state of the economy is eerily similar to what has happened in the past right before a major economic crash.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

When in fact they&amp;amp;#39;ve been turning it into BUSD, USDC, and various other cryptocurrencies. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVkgGHt33c&amp;amp;amp;t=343s&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVkgGHt33c&amp;amp;amp;t=343s&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; here is where the scam starts, he states where the coins will go and how the investor earns their yield. Promising to stake the bnb sent to them in return for WISB tokens. So let&amp;amp;#39;s track it and see where these coins went.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Let&amp;amp;#39;s track down where the initial half of the liquidity went to:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;1) Adding liquidity transaction&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://bscscan.com/tx/0xcf9bba00c849ff47f21b908935b02c95e174028af8bc68acb7f4f8401e212993&quot;&amp;gt;https://bscscan.com/tx/0xcf9bba00c849ff47f21b908935b02c95e174028af8bc68acb7f4f8401e212993&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;10,659.53 BNB (half of liquidity was sent)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To 0x88ecfe0a6428a104a8bde2f31ae771ae4d37f6b4 wallet&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Everything is fine here as it was advertised initially.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;2) After this this the wallet sent tokens to 0x1d60202d34444950e7cbad48a37245928e6184f6&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A couple of transaction proofs:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://bscscan.com/tx/0x43465ac119f88408022a97a436de2b32240f4a6d9fca2d37bb9ec6afa40f7de8&quot;&amp;gt;https://bscscan.com/tx/0x43465ac119f88408022a97a436de2b32240f4a6d9fca2d37bb9ec6afa40f7de8&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://bscscan.com/tx/0xae93f3ed2916d74459277711b22b17491339f4d07c005f2a01d02966019e62c8&quot;&amp;gt;https://bscscan.com/tx/0xae93f3ed2916d74459277711b22b17491339f4d07c005f2a01d02966019e62c8&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Check here:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://bscscan.com/txs?a=0x1d60202d34444950e7cbad48a37245928e6184f6&quot;&amp;gt;https://bscscan.com/txs?a=0x1d60202d34444950e7cbad48a37245928e6184f6&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As you can see here BNB were sent to BSC Hub (BNB staking)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;404.002+ 100.002+ 373.032+ 300.002+ 537.002+ 3,800.002+ 1,191.992 = 6,706.034 BNB&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After that, I lost track of where the remaining tokens went to because it was converted to BUSD, binance-peg USD, and mixed between wallets. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The question is where is the other 3,953.496 BNB? (37% of 10k BNB)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It was initially advertised in videos that all of the 10k will go to BNB staking and rewards will be airdropped to WISB stakers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some amount from rewards may go to developers&amp;amp;#39; salaries (but has to be reported how much, where, for what, etc).  Does a developer get paid 2 million per year? Lol.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;From what I can see 37% or 3.9k BNB ($2M at current price valuation) was converted to BUSD and USDC. After that was sent to multiple wallets, check it here:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://bscscan.com/token/0xe9e7cea3dedca5984780bafc599bd69add087d56?a=0x1d60202d34444950e7cbad48a37245928e6184f6&quot;&amp;gt;https://bscscan.com/token/0xe9e7cea3dedca5984780bafc599bd69add087d56?a=0x1d60202d34444950e7cbad48a37245928e6184f6&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://bscscan.com/token/0x55d398326f99059ff775485246999027b3197955?a=0x1d60202d34444950e7cbad48a37245928e6184f6&quot;&amp;gt;https://bscscan.com/token/0x55d398326f99059ff775485246999027b3197955?a=0x1d60202d34444950e7cbad48a37245928e6184f6&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;- plus some of BNB was converted to random tokens, added liquidity, and moved around inside (liquidity beneficiary) wallet:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://bscscan.com/address/0x88ecfe0a6428a104a8bde2f31ae771ae4d37f6b4&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;https://bscscan.com/address/0x88ecfe0a6428a104a8bde2f31ae771ae4d37f6b4&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hmm? Do they not realize we can see these transactions on a public ledger? This is literally the point of blockchain technology, are we that stupid? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As you can see in the videos Peter says that all BNB will go to staking.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Really 37% are gone to his &amp;amp;quot;development&amp;amp;quot; 2 million on development? Lol what are they developing for 2 million? Their wallets thats what.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And it is not clear if all rewards from staking are airdropped because he says $30k are airdropped weekly, however staking rewards can&amp;amp;#39;t be exactly $30k in value, excess of that must be cut to his wallets.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TL;DR the team is lining their pockets whilst leading on investors and essentially money-grabbing under the pretense of development.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So take time off the chart to learn more about blockchain tech, DeFi, how banks fucked the economy in 2008, etc.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

But it&amp;amp;#39;s not. I firmly believe we will get better in the mid to long term.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But this is just reminding me of 2018 too much. Day after day, week after week, my portfolio is losing a few %. With no end in sight. And the reasons are pulled out of thin air. September slump, November shenanigans, Christmas shopping, you name it. Now in 2022, I&amp;amp;#39;m just waiting for the same ol&amp;amp;#39; sayings from 2018. Chinese new year, wall street bonuses, January to end, March madness, and whatever idiotic saying there was to explain something that cannot be explained.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now with the FED rates raised (and more rates raised foreseen), I just can&amp;amp;#39;t help but feel... defeated.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I didn&amp;amp;#39;t invest more than I&amp;amp;#39;m willing to lose. I will not suffer financially if I lose EVERYTHING I have in crypto. That said, does anyone here LIKE losing any money?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I know it&amp;amp;#39;s volatile. That&amp;amp;#39;s why I love crypto. But this seems like it has no end in sight. And it just smells like 2018 all over again. And I just fall into this slump of how I felt back then. 10-20% dump daily. Going on for days and weeks. BTC was down 80% from ATH. All other alts over 90% (yes, even ETH). It&amp;amp;#39;s terribly exhausting.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Maybe I&amp;amp;#39;ll feel better smack down in the middle of bear run. That way I know there&amp;amp;#39;s no other option but to buy/DCA and stake. But now... I&amp;amp;#39;m scared.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yeah.. sure jan. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is such a horrible security practice that just doesnt need any explanation. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Definitely, nothing untoward can happen by entering your seed to login everytime.. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Oh wait.. they themselves prove how it could go horribly wrong.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Not only do you have to enter the seed, they are storing the seed in plaintext locally&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This horrendous security practice was noticed by user Nptacek. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The whole platform stinks tbh, if you go to their home page, its full of buy their shitcoin links instead of an actual social network. Decentralised social media networks like Mirror and GM already exist that do not have any token and can be used already. Mirror especially is growing in popularity as an alternative to Medium among crypto users. It doesnt have any token, and only uses Metamask to verify the authenticity of your account. For example Vitalik could verify himself with his ENS address. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Whereas DESO seems to be only interesting in pushing their token first and has a market cap of over $650m without even a functional product. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Why should I buy a token to use a decentralised social media network first?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Basically stocks become kind of a risky and uncertain assets while bonds become the opposite, safe haven, almost zero risk and guaranteed yield. That will eventually crash stocks/sp500 and so on. Understandably this means all huge institutional investors will take their money out of BTC. At best we are expecting another 2-3 to 4 year bear market before markets start to recover. BTC may as well go 10k under easily and stay there for a long time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On the other hand Jeff Booth and  Greg Floss may say that government can reduce money printing and improve bonds yields but that&amp;amp;#39;s just  temporary and eventually they will have to start printing lots of money again to avoid stock markets to crash because nobody wants that. Also they may say inflation is going to get worse and worse due to the money printing and the best bet against inflation is Bitcoin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But my opinion is that Bitcoin is not dependant on reddit users/bitcoin forums/youtube gurus etc. It&amp;amp;#39;s dependant on the big money! And big money is controlled mostly by people who consider BTC a very risky asset! (of course with the exceptions of Saylor, Cathie Wood and the early BTC Whales who have diamond hands for lifetime)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So I&amp;amp;#39;m thinking who exactly is going to put a lot of money in Bitcoin in a market crisis where stock are going down by 50% and more in a couple of weeks/months. Who is going to risk it? Also is US Government really able to prevent another mega stock market crash? Nasdaq Composite Index is currently at all time highs up around 600% from 2010!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But no, I&amp;amp;#39;m a HODLer. I believe in the tech long term. I believe that the coins I&amp;amp;#39;m invested in, will in 5-10 years time form the foundations of decentralised AI, finance and web3.0 infrastructure.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m likely to see a bear market or dip soon&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; but who cares?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The short-term dips won&amp;amp;#39;t matter in 5 years time!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;These kinds of gains take years in the stock market, and I&amp;amp;#39;ve seen them in less than a year&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; I was naive, waking up to my portfolio at higher highs every morning.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;-8%&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;That&amp;amp;#39;s my portfolio today.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All those unrealised gains, lost. Everything that was once beautiful flourishing green, is red like the blood of a slaughtered goat.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I considered selling some of my gains at the top, but I was too greedy. I wanted more. Had I taken some profits, I would&amp;amp;#39;ve had the opportunity to buy in at much lower prices.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;What am I going to do?&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m still HODLing.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; But I&amp;amp;#39;ve decided during the next bull run, I will take profit &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;(nothing massive, the initial investment or less)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; and hold those funds in wait for a significant dip. The dips do come and will come and I think it really benefits your mental health to be able to take some amount of profit.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Having this constant paranoia and fear of sending crypto to wrong addresses, I decide to look up the address he sent to me on etherscan, and I find quite a large balance with many transactions. I make a joke to my friend about how rich he was, but he tells me that he has a 0 balance. That was when the alarm bells started going off in my mind. I ask him to take note of the first two and last two characters in his ethereum address, copy it, and then paste it to me. He tells me the address changed when it was pasted from the windows clipboard. To be double sure, I ask him to make up a random set of numbers and letters of length 42, then copy and paste it in our chat.The fake addressthat was pasted changed.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;My suspicions were right.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In short, his computer was infected by the colormania malware that targets the windows clipboard. This malware checks whether a copied text has a particular length that is common to some blockchains and replaces the text or address, in this case, with the attacker&amp;amp;#39;s address. So when you hit paste and click the send button, the address changes and the funds are sent to the attacker instead. We found evidence of the malware at the task manager&amp;amp;#39;s background processes. And lo and behold, we found colormania running in there. I had him download and install Malwarebytes, which found several threats on his system and cleared it. Now, the values of addressed copied onto the clipboard no longer changed when he pasted them.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Personally its currently my second biggest holding after ETH.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Richard Heart, aka Richard J. Schueler, aka, J. Richard, aka James Hart is linked to a Panama criminal network which included corrupt lawyers and judges.
Heart also sold anti-aging cures in between roles as Spam King and Bitcoin thought leader.
Richard Heart, founder of controversial cryptocurrency project HEX (HEX), has been outed as a former internet scammer and ‘Spam King’.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://techtelegraph.co.uk/crypto-hex-founder-is-actually-notorious-criminal-spam-king/&quot;&amp;gt;https://techtelegraph.co.uk/crypto-hex-founder-is-actually-notorious-criminal-spam-king/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Heart now charades as a thought leader in the cryptocurrency space, but while Satoshi Nakamoto was working on Bitcoin, Heart was hocking anti-ageing remedies.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Methuselah Foundation, for which Heart apparently volunteered, is committed to extending the human lifespan and “making 90 the new 50”. The video below shows Heart in between his spells as Spam King and crypto thought leader.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://cryptotraderspro.com/hex-founder-outed-spam-king/&quot;&amp;gt;link&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The cryptocurrency’s official website even claims that the asset is “designed for 10,000x returns,” something that even the SEC would say fails their Howey test, which helps investors determine if an investment is too good to be true and may be a scam.
 &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newsbtc.com/news/why-this-developer-of-the-controversial-hex-cryptocurrency-accused-of-scam-left/&quot;&amp;gt;link&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Most recently, a Reddit user pointed out that 800 Ether tokens were withdrawn from the wallet used to store the proceeds from HEX token sale, and 770 Ether were sent to two crypto exchanges - Binance and Bitfinex.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/exit-scam-500-eth-from-hex-ico-wallet-liquidated/amp/&quot;&amp;gt;link &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The list goes on and on and on. All of the articles saying it isn&amp;amp;#39;t a scam are clearly paid for, the only SEO ranking against the coin is Reddit, luckily you can&amp;amp;#39;t pay for Reddit rankings. Hex even run a site saying they&amp;amp;#39;re not a scam, lmao imagine if any other coin did this? Massive red flags.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However, since joining this sub my Crypto portfolio is definitely performing a lot better than it was beforehand. Yes, this is largely due to this being a major hub for crypto news, but advice I’ve been given by others on here has definitely helped me out too. Here are some of the best pieces of advice I’ve been given:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;BTC/ETH should make up around 70% of your portfolio&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Staking as a method of passive income&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Earning free BAT through the Brave browser&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;How to set up a hard wallet, and why I should&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Importance of understanding Tokenomics&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;2 of my top 5 gainers this year were introduced to me through this sub (won’t name as this isn’t a shill post)&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This sub definitely isn’t all that bad, and there are some very smart people in here. What’s the best piece of advice you’ve been given on this sub?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;EDIT: Some great mentions in the comments that I feel should be highlighted in the main body (as I know some won’t bother to read the comments)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Don’t invest more than you can afford to lose&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Time in the market &amp;amp;gt; timing the market&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I 10x&amp;amp;#39;d my money investing into ATOM, SYS, HOT, LUNA, LRC etc. and I was way over the moon. I thought I was fucking invincible... &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I was going around suggesting people to set stop limits, do not invest more money than you can afford and of course, I shilled for coins that I held. I had this baseless stupid confidence that comes with the money that I never had before.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then came 2022... I was talking with my friends about decent coins they can potentially invest in and the topic of leverage came up. We talked about the potential money I could earn, calculated the amount I&amp;amp;#39;d have if the coin I invested in mooned and then after dreaming about what I can do with the money I can potentially earn, it got to me... why not try out leverage on Binance and went right into 3x leverage. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I didn&amp;amp;#39;t even bother checking the interest rate, I forgot about all the principles I had with coin trading and borrowed the maximum amount and went all in. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I don&amp;amp;#39;t fucking know what got to me. Hype threads that talk about potential moon, people around me asking for advice, the money that I never had before... I&amp;amp;#39;d have held through the drop if this was just normal trading because I believe that it will always bounce back and maybe even go even further but with leverage... I cannot afford to hold. If whatever coin I buy drops even for a little bit I am left with no money and no way of earning what I lost back.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now, I sold all the coins I owned for BUSD and I am on the brink of liquidation at margin level of 1.14. The interest rate is piling up, I barely slept last few days and I am literally sweating due to anxiety. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I just wanted a place where I can vent about my stupidity. Thanks for reading... or not reading. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;*&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;tl;dr i am confident. i touch leverage. coin market goes boom. i am broke and fucked beyond measure. *&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;** point: don&amp;amp;#39;t touch leverage unless you have enough that you can use money as a toilet paper. **&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We often say &amp;amp;#39;&amp;amp;#39;moonboys never learn&amp;amp;quot;. Let me hit you with some facts:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Nov 2013. Bitcoin hits ATH of 1154$ and corrects to 227$ in Aug 2015. hitting new ATH Apr 2017.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Dec 2017. ATH of 19500$, corrects to 3300$ in Jan 2019. hitting new ATH Dec 2020.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Nov 2021. ATH of 69000$.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What have we learned? It takes around 2 years from ATH to hit bottom, and 2 more years to hit new ATH. And corrections are around 80%.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Retail and Industry are now heavily involved in cryptocurrency‘s, it went mainstream last year, The richest man in the world openly share the fact they HODL. I helped my mother set her account up last month! This is not the same space anymore.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;/u/Jxntb733&quot;&amp;gt;u/Jxntb733&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; is 2y old account and surely wasn&amp;amp;#39;t here in 2018. when McAfee said bubbles are mathematically impossible in this new financial paradigm. People also said Bitcoin is now too big to be a bubble. That&amp;amp;#39;s like the biggest red flag in bubbles, when people claim that something is too big to fail. You know, like Dot com bubble was too big to explode, 2008. housing market, and now crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyways, what&amp;amp;#39;s exactly different then 2018? People still use crypto for one and only purpuse: to watch it grow in fiat value. Also, different is that now we have modern day Tulip mania called NFT&amp;amp;#39;s, we have rupulls, awful memecoins, and more scams. I haven&amp;amp;#39;t seen bigger adoption then 4 years ago. Also, should I mention Tether printing usdt without any backing? Blockchain still haven&amp;amp;#39;t founded a single problem to solve since 2018. All I see is hype, new shitcoins, new NFTs, new scams, talks is still only about price, gains, profits. I&amp;amp;#39;m sorry but Bitcoin is no better then 5 years ago.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now, after this snap back to reality, I just want to say that&amp;amp;#39;s completely ok if Bitcoin hits 20k or even 10k before next rally to 100k in this decade. You just need to be rational with your money and patient. I belive in cryptocurrencies in long run. Stay safe and hydrated bros.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And what about all those influencers and celebrities and rich people. They promised me that they know this is a fact and people never lie, especially not for something so important like money!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also everyone said BTC was a guaranteed hedge against inflation and inflation is like 40% in Turkey right now so BTC must go up by at least 100%, that&amp;amp;#39;s just super obvious to anyone.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So I stand by BTC and I stand by 100k 2021 and I invite you to join me. Ley nothing and no one stop us from achieving our dreams!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

And of course you guys are upvoting this.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That&amp;amp;#39;s garbage. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gapminder.org/answers/how-many-are-rich-and-how-many-are-poor/&quot;&amp;gt;A billion people have less than 1 USD a day&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. Those that have a bit more than that are not exactly rich either. There are millions of homeless people around the world, many of which don&amp;amp;#39;t have access to the internet to buy crypto - and none of which have money to do so. There are so, so many people in the world who cannot afford to buy enough food, pay rent, or other important commodities, and many more who can barely do so but have nothing left in their bank account at the end of the month. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Those people are definitely too poor to buy crypto&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sure, don&amp;amp;#39;t get me wrong, if you get by and only have a few bucks each month to gamble away, you&amp;amp;#39;re not too poor to buy crypto, you can just buy small amounts and it&amp;amp;#39;s fine. But saying &amp;amp;quot;Nobody is “too poor” to invest&amp;amp;quot;, as one of the commenters did, is just arrogant - and blatantly wrong.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Edit: please stop telling me that this is also true for other investments. Of course it is. My point is that people like to pretend while this is true for other investments, the barrier is so low for crypto that it isn&amp;amp;#39;t true for crypto. I&amp;amp;#39;m not saying crypto is more exclusive than other investments, I&amp;amp;#39;m saying it isn&amp;amp;#39;t really more inclusive&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Here are 5 top crypto strategies worth noting. Good Luck!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Day Trading&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;  - As a digital asset investor, you should be familiar with various resources and strategies. Basically, there are two types of trading strategies you can choose from. Active, which requires more time and attention and involves constant monitoring, and passive, which allows for a more hands-off approach.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Trend Tading&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; - One of the active strategies, trend trading, also sometimes known as position trading, is a tactic in which an investor will hold their position for a longer span of time, usually a few months. If you choose to be a trend trader, you need to keep up with directional trends and know how to take advantage of them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Scalping&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; - The last active strategy on our list is scalping, which focuses on small moves repeated over and over again and taking advantage of inefficiencies in the market such as gaps in liquidity. Scalpers open and close their positions in a short period of time, sometimes even in a matter of seconds.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;HODL&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; - If none of the active strategies seem like something you would be interested in, you might explore passive ones such as the buy and hold strategy. In this strategy, investors purchase a large sum of assets and hold it for a long time without paying attention to market fluctuations.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Index Investing&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; - Finishing off with another passive investment strategy, index investing focuses on buying ETFs, which you can purchase on centralized cryptocurrency exchanges. You can create a crypto index by creating a basket of all of your assets and then making a special token that will track their combined performance.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
