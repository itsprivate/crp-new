The coin has seen an insane increase over the past couple months.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TRON has recently launched its algorithmic stablecoin &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usdd/&quot;&amp;gt;USDD&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. The algorithm governing the stablecoin‚Äôs dollar-peg is an arbitrage trade between USDD and TRX, Tron&amp;amp;#39;s network‚Äôs native token. &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Hmm... this reminds me of something but I can&amp;amp;#39;t put my finger on it....&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now here&amp;amp;#39;s this week&amp;amp;#39;s best offer! &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/a/JoFQgSH&quot;&amp;gt;You can earn up to 57% through sun.io&amp;amp;#39;s LP!&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; What a great deal.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;According to &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://defillama.com/peggedassets/stablecoins&quot;&amp;gt;Defillama&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; USDD is #10 stablecoin by market cap, with a 20% increase over the past week, this figure is up from $90 million recorded during its day of launch on &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;May 5, 2022&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Hmm... I have a vouge memory of something that happened in early May 2022...&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Oh and we haven&amp;amp;#39;t even checked the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;project&amp;amp;#39;s founder, Justin Sun.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Let&amp;amp;#39;s get started:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Justin Sun launched TRON&amp;amp;#39;s whitepaper during the ICO craze in 2017, days before China&amp;amp;#39;s ban on ICO&amp;amp;#39;s. He raised $70 million and left the country. Sun had been &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;tipped off by Changpeng ‚ÄúCZ‚Äù Zhao, the founder and CEO of Binance.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Does this also sound familiar....? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On top of that. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://coincentral.com/community-accuses-tron-plagiarizing-whitepaper/&quot;&amp;gt;it&amp;amp;#39;s been also reported that he copy pasted the project&amp;amp;#39;s whitepaper from another coin&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. This only adds to the pile of cards that his so called &amp;amp;quot;algorithmic stablecoin&amp;amp;quot; is a scam waiting to collapse.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is no coincidence that Justin also left China, days after the ICO ban was announced.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On top of all that, it&amp;amp;#39;s been reported that:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He hosted a ton of fake giveaways in 2019 announcing fake winners and retracting prizes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He announced fake partnerships with big organizations such as Liverpool F.C., who have denied connections.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s been reported that Justin has sold most of his TRON coins after the ICO and bought a large chunk of ETH. Some say he owns more ETH than the projects&amp;amp;#39; Co-Founder Vitalik.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/c/22947663/justin-sun-tron-cryptocurrency-poloniex&quot;&amp;gt;You can read more here&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So, what do we make of all these? Justin Sun, the creator of TRX and USDD, not only literally copy pasted everything, he has also been involved in a huge amount of sketchy dealings and scams. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My hope is that people like Justin and projects like LUNA and TRX are wiped off entirely from the market, for this is the only way to move forward and build something meaningful.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

And when I say &amp;amp;quot;in depth&amp;amp;quot;, I&amp;amp;#39;m not kidding: journalist Laura Shin gives an almost daily description of the days of Vitalik Buterin and other developers for the period 2013-2018. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;She interviewed hundreds of people and consulted thousands of documents of all kinds, both on the blockchain and in official reports from the Ethereum Foundation, to paint a picture of this historic crypto moment.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The book came out last February, I received it in early April, and I just finished reading it. Here is five things I learned!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;1-Crypto is fundamentally a chaotic universe and full of drama&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The first months of Ethereum were marked by disputes, dissension, power plays and total chaos. Developers bickered with financiers, financiers bickered with the Ethereum Foundation, the Ethereum Foundation bickered with community members, and community members bickered with each other... Many great people were involved in the project, and their egos often took precedence over the common good.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The book left me with the impression that chaos was inherent in the crypto world. No project, even the most popular and best built, escapes it. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;2-Charles Hoskinson, founder of Cardano, is a liar&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I am absolutely sorry, and this is not a judgment on Cardano&amp;amp;#39;s blockchain, but there is no longer any doubt in my mind that Charles Hoskinson is a liar who has taken advantage of his proximity to Vitalik Buterin to build a reputation. He self-proclaimed himself &amp;amp;quot;CEO&amp;amp;quot; of Ethereum, an absurd title, and then spent his days talking about Lamborghinis while smoking cigars while the real developers did all the work. He also made it look like he was a PhD candidate, which is not true: he never got past the undergrad stage. Even worse: when confronted with the evidence by Laura Shin, he refused to admit the truth and continued to lie, Do Kwon style.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;3-Money makes everyone lose their mind... except Vitalik&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Initially, despite the bickering, there was generally a good-natured atmosphere in the Ethereum developer community. But when the price of ether started to rise, people started to show their true colors. The DAO hack is a perfect example: the person who executed this attack would have been a hero in the community if he or she had chosen the path of honesty, and he or she would have been rewarded; but the amount of money at stake - in the hundreds of millions of dollars - made him or her lose his or her mind, and the person tried to keep it all to himself or herself. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Conversely, there is Vitalik Buterin, whose personal fortune is valued in the hundreds of millions of dollars, but who couldn&amp;amp;#39;t care less. Imagine what Ethereum would look like if a narcissistic megalomaniac had been at its helm... &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;4-The nerds always win&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Several times in the early years of Ethereum, the project could have gone very wrong. Multiple &amp;amp;quot;DOS&amp;amp;quot; attacks were launched, financiers wanted to &amp;amp;quot;sell&amp;amp;quot; Ethereum to private companies, jealous developers wanted to convince regulatory authorities that Ethereum was a bad project...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But at the end of the day, the nerds won. Why did they win? Because they are the only ones who truly understand the full potential of blockchain technology. So they put their heart and soul into it, often at the expense of their personal lives. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Never bet against the nerds; in an increasingly digital world, they will always win.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;5-Nobody knows what the future will bring&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We are all convinced on this sub that crypto will play an important role in the economy of the future. But one thing I took away from my reading is that no one knows what the technology will be used for.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Vitalik Buterin, for example, never saw non-fungible tokens coming; at least, certainly not that they would be used to sell monkey pictures. If even the inventor of Ethereum couldn&amp;amp;#39;t foresee the explosion in popularity of ERC-721, how can we mere mortals claim to know what crypto will look like in five years?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My takeaway is that you always have to keep an open mind if you want to survive in this universe. We are still in the infancy of crypto, no matter what the no-coiners say, and no one knows what the future holds. I find it exciting!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I hope this short summary was helpful, and I wish you all a very green weekly candle!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

It&amp;amp;#39;s not the sure-fire doomsday scenario it was 2 months ago.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;The herd.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When it comes to investing, be careful of following the herd.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Last year, the herd thought Bitcoin was heading to the moon and could hit $100K. And that&amp;amp;#39;s when the herd was overbuying.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Things aren&amp;amp;#39;t looking good. But is the data really showing only doomsday? I&amp;amp;#39;ll explore that in details.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Not every correction is a recession. Not every bear market is long term (see the 2013 mini bear market of 5 months for Bitcoin).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Inflation:&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is the big one. Inflation is still high, but it&amp;amp;#39;s showing signs of slowing down, and potentially having peaked already. If it starts going down, will it still be able to fuel further market fears?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Both CPI and PCE rates have slowed down.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;-CPI slowed from 8.5% in March down to 8.2% in April.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;-PCE has slowed from 6.6% in March down to 6.2% in April.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Obviously real inflation is higher, but these are important for later when we talk about Fed rates.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But what about food and gas still being so expensive? It still costs me so much, how can it have peaked? That brings up the next two points.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Supply chain:&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Probably one of the biggest wrench getting in the way of economic growth in the last 2 years.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Luckily, the supply chain is beginning to reopen, and the bottleneck is getting unclogged. But it has been an uneven recovery.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While you see a lot of items back on the shelves, and shipment taking less time, you have other items like baby formula vanishing from the shelves.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The big one everyone is waiting for is for China to join in that de-clogging. They&amp;amp;#39;re still behind due to their more recent lockdowns.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the US this year:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;47% drop in ship congestion (those ships anchored waiting outside a port).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;12% increase in containers in the main ports (LA, New Jersey, New York, Long beach).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In Europe, they experienced a setback with the war in Ukraine. With some ports getting increases in delays by several hours, sometimes up to two days.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In terms of sea shipping  worldwide, the bottleneck is still high thanks to China and Russia, but we are starting to also see signs that it has peaked:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/6t9zd84c4n291.png?width=990&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=54d4e555c3b0f72dcde6e85bafb82c87ccc0ee31&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/6t9zd84c4n291.png?width=990&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=54d4e555c3b0f72dcde6e85bafb82c87ccc0ee31&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Things are still not looking great and are uneven, but it looks like in many countries we are starting to see things turn around.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Overall, the world waiting time for all cargo ships has dropped. Going from 17 million container waiting days down to 6 million.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Oil: the domino effect that could put the breaks on a recession.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Oil prices has everyone worried.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It has also been a big contributors for rising CPI numbers, and the perceived inflation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It has also been a problem for supply chains, along with businesses. And has put strain on many companies in the stock market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So it&amp;amp;#39;s been in the middle of almost all of our problems.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here&amp;amp;#39;s some good news.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One of the main reason it&amp;amp;#39;s so high, is because OPEC hasn&amp;amp;#39;t increased the output to keep up with the big emerging demand from the post covid crisis, nor make up for the strain from the war in Ukraine.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The purposely held back output to let price rises, to makeup for all the money they lost when oil prices tanked in 2020. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;OPEC is actually due to increase the output in July, per their internal agreement, by 400K barrels per day. So relief will begin this summer.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The G7 meeting has asked them to increase it by even more. So we&amp;amp;#39;ll have to see how big the relief will be.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If oil price output increases significantly, it could bring the price down more significantly, helping everything from inflation to supply chains and businesses.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And it could create a domino effect that could help ignite a potential recovery.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Fed rates:&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Rates don&amp;amp;#39;t have much uncertainty left. Feds have already laid out the roadmap. We know how high they want to go. And unless inflation starts to spiral out of control again, it looks like they are targeting 2-2.5% rates. So only going back to pre-covid rates.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These are still economic stimulation level of rates. They&amp;amp;#39;re not high rates.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now that we got a good idea on how fast they&amp;amp;#39;ll go with the point basis, there&amp;amp;#39;s not much left that hasn&amp;amp;#39;t been priced in already.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The only question is the Fed balance sheet unloading. That&amp;amp;#39;s a little harder to predict the effect. But there won&amp;amp;#39;t be a selling off, they&amp;amp;#39;ll just let bonds expire.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also, keep in mind that legislation has changed a little, with the ability for banks to get their liquidity. So it won&amp;amp;#39;t be quiet the same as it was in the past.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;War in Ukraine:&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I can&amp;amp;#39;t really say too much about this. There&amp;amp;#39;s no clear metrics to talk about here.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This could end next month, or it could end in 5 years.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One thing we do know, is Putin wasn&amp;amp;#39;t able to roll over Ukraine, and move on to the next conquest.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In terms of market uncertainty, it has fizzled out a little bit, and is nowhere near at the level of fear as the early days of the war.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;US GDP:&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is the one place where we can still see an alarming case for a recession.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The GDP has decreased by 1.5%.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That&amp;amp;#39;s as bad as it can get.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But a big part of that decrease was actually caused by the trade deficit, rather than a decrease in spending. Consumer spending actually increased by 2.7%. Inflation adjusted, it still increased by 0.7%.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also, supply chain issues, and slower inventory accumulation fueled that decrease. The effect of high inflation also didn&amp;amp;#39;t help.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But if those problems have already reached their peak, ports are now getting unclogged, and with the trade deficit already going back down, we can have better expectations for much better GDP numbers next quarter.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Can we still have a recession?&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Both in crypto and other markets.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While things may look like they have reached their peak, and there are some improvements already, you never know when there could be set backs.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So I&amp;amp;#39;m definitely not trying to be Nostradamus here. I&amp;amp;#39;m just saying a recession is not 100% in the cards. In fact, it may be starting to diminish in probabilities.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is definitely not your 2008 recession. We still have low unemployment, a strong housing market, trade deficit dropping 15.9%, growing consumer spending, and we don&amp;amp;#39;t have foreclosures popping up everywhere.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bankruptcies filling have also been dropping in the US:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/2ue7dlkj4n291.png?width=782&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=dcbc5af846604e4b395b270d7aacdf7f80cdba1b&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/2ue7dlkj4n291.png?width=782&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=dcbc5af846604e4b395b270d7aacdf7f80cdba1b&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What&amp;amp;#39;s important is to understand the cause of all this, to understand if we are heading straight into a recession.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;The cause.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Where did it all go wrong, and how did we get here in both crypto and other markets?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Long story short: liquidity supply crunch.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Both crypto and stocks have been getting extra fuel with the extra liquidity being printed into the market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Both went a little too high too fast, and got a little overbought.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It was natural that we&amp;amp;#39;d get a correction once the Fed turned off that printer.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So this isn&amp;amp;#39;t exactly a crash where you have foreclosures popping up all over neighborhoods, bankruptcies, and financial institutions collapsing, like in 2008.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is more the market correcting to adjust back to normal pre-covid liquidity.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In fact, for crypto, it may not even be like 2018, and be more like 2013.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Where we got a mini bear market for 5 months in the middle of a bull cycle:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/flk4i3235n291.jpg?width=1262&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=3d96d3ac5785cd6cd0b9443eb4d6abd73270e1a0&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/flk4i3235n291.jpg?width=1262&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=3d96d3ac5785cd6cd0b9443eb4d6abd73270e1a0&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;tl;dr:&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All the same macos that were supporting the theory that we were heading into a long recession, are now showing signs of either peaking, slowing down, or even turning around.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And if a couple of key macros like GDP, supply chain, or oil have a significant turnaround, it could create a domino effect that could fuel a recovery. Or at the very least erase a lot of the fuel behind the recession.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And all 3 are showing data that they are likely to turn around in the coming months.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This doesn&amp;amp;#39;t mean it will necessarily happen, or that we won&amp;amp;#39;t have a long recession. There&amp;amp;#39;s still a strong possibility. Just not as strong as many people think, and definitely not close to 100%. And the likelihood has begun to decrease.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

He said, he had &amp;amp;quot;a model that predicts the last 2 BTC bottom prices&amp;amp;quot; and based on this model, predicted what the next bottom price will be. In the comments, he showed a lot of confidence in his complex model, because &amp;amp;quot;There is a reasoning behind&amp;amp;quot; it and &amp;amp;quot;It&amp;amp;#39;s gonna happen&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Okay, so I thought even though two data points is not really great (to be very euphemistic) and using data from those two data points to predict the same data points is, uh, not best practice, I&amp;amp;#39;m curious what sort of factors they included in their model to get to their estimate. Had to be somewhat complex for them to be so convinced, right?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yeah, no. After eyeballing the &amp;amp;quot;data&amp;amp;quot;, I immediately saw that the BTC &amp;amp;quot;model&amp;amp;quot; was:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;2013 bull run: bottom was roughly ATH divided by 6.5&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;2017 bull run: bottom was roughly ATH divided by 6&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;prediction: so this time it will be ATH divided by 5.5&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Seriously, that&amp;amp;#39;s the whole &amp;amp;quot;model&amp;amp;quot;. His ETH model was even more complex: it&amp;amp;#39;s only based on a single data point but hey, that&amp;amp;#39;s more than zero I guess? There their prediction, which is calculated &amp;amp;quot;applying a corrective factor (eth volatility)&amp;amp;quot; is even more complex: &amp;amp;quot;ETH bottom is always previous ATH divided by 12&amp;amp;quot;. That&amp;amp;#39;s maths for you!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Someone else said in the comments &amp;amp;quot;If you want to see some real math possibilities, then check out the BTC/ETH rainbow charts.&amp;amp;quot; - Jesus, people! It was literally created &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ercwl/status/1341061789182791683&quot;&amp;gt;as a joke&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, there&amp;amp;#39;s no maths behind it and no, it doesn&amp;amp;#39;t work!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Why am I making this post? Because if you&amp;amp;#39;re new-ish to crypto (or just a bit naive) and are seeing a post like that, you might think that those people probably know more than you if they make those predictions, and you might think &amp;amp;quot;even if they are not precise, how can those data-driven predictions be far off?&amp;amp;quot;. The truth is pretty easy, however: &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;predictions like that are complete garbage&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. Not every prediction is on the level of &amp;amp;quot;complete this series of numbers&amp;amp;quot; like the one above, that could be an assignment for like a fourth grader, some include more numbers and complex model specifications. But they&amp;amp;#39;re still complete nonsense. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We simply don&amp;amp;#39;t know what will happen - maybe the economy will crash, maybe it will boom, maybe another LUNA-like fiasco will happen. Those things affect how BTC and ETH will behave. You can build a model that perfectly predicts previous ATHs or ATLs or whatever - honestly, it&amp;amp;#39;s very, very easy - and it doesn&amp;amp;#39;t help you even a bit predicting the future.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Long story short: all &amp;amp;quot;technical analysis&amp;amp;quot; is complete nonsense and you shouldn&amp;amp;#39;t fall for it - no matter if it&amp;amp;#39;s done by someone on the level of a 10-year old like the OP I am quoting or something more complex.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So what does this c#ck head do‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.creates Luna 2.0. This is a regulators wet dream. The optics on this whole thing are so incredibly bad.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To ALL of the exchanges out there who listed this token‚Ä¶‚Ä¶you fucked up. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Not only do the regulators have hard on for flogs like Do Kwon, but you are in their crosshairs even more now. Exchanges literally listed the exit pump token for Do Kwon‚Äôs initial ponzi. Utterly psychotic. Like how can they be so stupid.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Exchanges should have denied the listing of Luna 2.0. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is why we are so far away from full scale adoption. It‚Äôs bullshit like this and maybe it‚Äôs time for the regs to come in and clean this bullshit up. A lot of people lost a lot of money in the last couple of weeks, Do Kwon is causing more and more damage every day he is active in the crypto asset class.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

While people still invest in bitcoin hoping to cash out for fiat, you can be sure bitcoin will not decouple from fiat currency, and you&amp;amp;#39;ll see the &amp;amp;quot;value&amp;amp;quot; of it move with other markets tied to fiat (although we all know the real value is priceless)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We know the central banking system is collapsing. The ship is sinking and they cannot keep it afloat much longer. Decades of manipulation and Bipolar policy has damaged fiat beyond repair. It&amp;amp;#39;s going to zero, as it has in many areas of the world already. When you buy bitcoin you should understand you&amp;amp;#39;re betting against the central banks. You&amp;amp;#39;re betting against fiat currency altogether. You&amp;amp;#39;re expressing your desire to see this decentralized monetary system become the standard, so you should expect to have to hold for a decade or several decades to see the vision come true. Once the fiat currency system finally collapses for good (and it will) your Bitcoin will be the only life raft you have. It will be the only life raft anyone has, and then you&amp;amp;#39;ll see everything else valued in satoshis. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Do you think the world is going back to trading physical gold when fiat finally collapses? I don&amp;amp;#39;t think so. In today&amp;amp;#39;s world technology is important and convenience. The world will choose bitcoin when central banking dies. Get on the boat and don&amp;amp;#39;t sell your bitcoin for any shitcoins especially the ultimate shitcoin USD.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You know what does go to the moon? Layoffs, interest rates, political and social strife, corruption, disease, death. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That&amp;amp;#39;s what to prepare for. Have a safety net of some kind. Do you have savings for if you or your partner(s) get laid off? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What do you do if the place you&amp;amp;#39;re renting gets sold off to cover some landlord&amp;amp;#39;s margin, and the new buyer raises your rents past what you can afford?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Do you have skills and network and savings to survive if suddenly your luck goes worse for 3-6 months?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If not, that&amp;amp;#39;s where to focus. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Learn from the past. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
