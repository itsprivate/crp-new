&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Another user bid the NFT for 1.9 ETH. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;@franklinisbored then accepted the 1.9 ETH but forgot to cancel his own 100 ETH fake bid.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;New owner then got the NFT then accepted the 100 ETH bid. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;@franklinisbored lost his 100 ETH in the process.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;He is now asking for the buyer to return his 100 ETH thru a letter. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;He also sent back the 1.9 ETH to him.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The whole incident happened to a NFT called &amp;amp;quot;stop-doing-fake-bids-its-honestly-lame-my-guy.eth&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

People putting hundreds of thousands of dollars in one project because they somehow trusted a commercial entity with everything they&amp;amp;#39;ve saved.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The shear amount of risk that is involved with crypto just cannot be understated.....there just is absolutely no guarantee here, and really a high probability of not even breaking even.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Really having any amount in crypto that will negatively impact your quality of life if lost should be carefully considered. At the end of the day it&amp;amp;#39;s the individuals choice, but dam is it tragic seeing so much hurt from these failed projects months later.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For those who do not know, &amp;amp;quot;Whale No. 3&amp;amp;quot; is a well-known holder of bitcoin and has gotten famous due to the sheer amount of BTC and anonymity. You can check out their holding here&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/address/1P5ZEDWTKTFGxQjZphgWPQUpe554WKDfHQ&quot;&amp;gt;https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/address/1P5ZEDWTKTFGxQjZphgWPQUpe554WKDfHQ&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That wallet currently holds over 117k BTC (valued at 2.6 billion USD). Nobody knows if this whale operates as an individual or an institution but it has been active for multiple market cycles.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Over the cycles, the whale has been rather accurate in the local tops and bottoms. During the summer lulls of 2021, it was accumulating. Then it started selling into Q4 of 2021. Some people keep 24/7 tabs on the whale&amp;amp;#39;s wallet activity using it as buy/sell signals. Sometimes the whale gets things wrong and loses (millions of USD ouch), but more often than not it gains huge.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/e2v17dyk5jc91.png?width=716&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=d0e77d350fa54c1b341a3f9a8d80f1f7f2210b6a&quot;&amp;gt;a c c u m u l a t e&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;During the past 1 month, when everyone was insanely bearish calling for 10-12k BTC, the whale was accumulating loads of BTC. Summing up to over 5k BTC. Congrats to people who followed the whale&amp;amp;#39;s decision.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/6vi8czuw5jc91.png?width=473&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=04b57c3aa78ec32b6bf57f7905f16df6442a76e2&quot;&amp;gt;yo chill out man&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Today, it has just moved 15.5k BTC out of the wallet. It could be just a movement, but highly likely it&amp;amp;#39;s a sell. We are currently at major resistances at multiple timeframes, and this huge movement is piling onto the indicators.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Well we all know nobody knows shit about fuck, I&amp;amp;#39;m just here to report something which this sub doesn&amp;amp;#39;t seem to pay much attention to.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Im way too old and unattractive to be fiddling with TikTok but if any of you is using it, I highly recommend that you move your assets to new wallet(s) as the possibility of TikTok acquiring your seed-phrase and a ton of other personal data is very high. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I know a lot of people with 6-figure incomes that are basically living paycheck to paycheck or are in debt up to their eyeballs.  I also know a lot of people with median incomes for their area who are much more disciplined and financially literate and have more wealth than the aforementioned 6-figure earners.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Something I have noticed is that this subreddit and many other crypto centric subreddits are filled with people with poor personal financial literacy and discipline, regardless of their income level.  There are also many people in the crypto space that actually do have a gambling addiction.  I also believe there are many bad faith participants egging these kinds of people on to FOMO invest so they can get their pump and dump short term play quotas in.  These kinds of posts have existed since the days of the early internet in stock discussion newsgroups and dial-up BBS.  Hell, they even existed pre-internet when guys like Jordan Belfort (Wolf of Wall Street) created cold call centers to drive penny stock pump and dumps.  The manipulations are not new, but the scale and speed with which they can be executed due to social media and everyone having access to the internet is and the best way to protect yourself from the knock-on effects is to be educated and financially literate.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;How To Get Financially Literate&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So how does one achieve financial literacy?  That is a big topic which is too big for a single post.  There are a lot of resources.  Being redditors, you might start here:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://np.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics/&quot;&amp;gt;https://np.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I truly believe every single person in this subreddit should have a strong understanding on the importance of basic personal finance topics like bad vs good debt, emergency funds, budgets, and IRA&amp;amp;#39;s before considering investing anything in crypto.  Without this very basic level of financial literacy, what you are doing is not investing, it&amp;amp;#39;s gambling.  In fact, investing and gambling are very close to the same thing... the main difference is the amount of knowledge and risk management put in place.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now keep in mind, many people that are conservative about personal finance are also biased to think in absolute negative terms about emerging technology like crypto.  I am not one of them.  I think crypto should play an important part in many people&amp;amp;#39;s investment portfolio.  However, it is a very high risk investment and should only make up a small portion of most people&amp;amp;#39;s overall investments.  Truly investing only what you can comfortably afford to lose is the best way to approach crypto in these very early, very volatile times.  I know you&amp;amp;#39;ve heard that phrase a thousand times, but many don&amp;amp;#39;t grasp what amount it means to be able to &amp;amp;quot;comfortably lose&amp;amp;quot;.  Basically, even if you are able to pay your bills and still have a 6-month emergency fund, if you are losing sleep over what you have invested or if it&amp;amp;#39;s occupying an uncomfortable amount of your time and thoughts, you probably have invested more than you can comfortably afford to lose.  It&amp;amp;#39;s not just what you can afford to lose and still live just about sustenance level, it&amp;amp;#39;s what you can afford to lose and not feel angry, emotional, or mad about it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Responsibly Investing In Crypto&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I am a strong believer in the technological and societal impact that cryptocurrencies and other decentralized data and processing projects can have in the future.  However, I am also very cautious about my crypto investments because I also have personal experience from the dotcom bubble era to know that volatility is normal for new and emerging technology.  There will some big winners, but also the majority of projects and companies related to crypto will fail.  Be prepared for failure, but also put yourself in a position for taking advantage of opportunities when they come along without risking too much.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Exceptions&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now, I do understand, some people may not be able to get a median level job.  Some have been born into systemic disadvantages, family situations, or other extenuating circumstances that make it very difficult to even get to median level.  For people in these kinds of situations, the best advice I have to give is to just keep building your skillset and your experience.  Also keep networking and making connections.  In my experience, many of the best opportunities come about from knowing the right people, and the more people you know the better your chances of one of them being the right person at the right time.  You don&amp;amp;#39;t have to set the bar too high, just set it somewhere you can realistically aim for and keep building on that.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Lastly, I also recognize there are people that can get a median level job or better but don&amp;amp;#39;t want to be financially literate or disciplined.  They want to chase the adrenaline of a big win, put it all on the line and try to get rich quick, be lucky, etc.  You know what?  If this is your choice, it&amp;amp;#39;s what makes you happy, and you are not hurting other people with your choices, I&amp;amp;#39;m not one to tell you not to do it if that&amp;amp;#39;s what you want.  Just know it&amp;amp;#39;s your choice, you could have done it a different way that would have virtually guaranteed you at least a certain level of financial security, and even if you &amp;amp;quot;hit it big&amp;amp;quot; there&amp;amp;#39;s also a good chance you might be continuing your bad habits of chasing the adrenaline rush and might lose everything if you never learn basic financial literacy and discipline.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Some reasons have been the LUNA-UST collapse but also a very bad business model of the exchange where the crypto hedge fund basically just borrowed money from many other companies without every repaying that and now even those companies are going bankrupt.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So what did they do with that borrowed money, obviously they used it to improve their project and safety for their customers. Well from the $72M borrowed from Celsius, $50M directly went to the founder Su Zhu and he bought a yacht with that money.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I mean apperantly the project was always supposed to be a total scam and their team never took it serious. Sadly there are still such projects out there so be careful what you trust in.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

There are people making claims that crypto ATL will be in when the stock market is also at an ATL. The way I see it, BTC and alts follow the Nasdaq. The worst stock market bear markets lasted two to three years. This one is about six months old now.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So with the crypto bear market happening, what happened to the crypto services lately? Especially the exchanges and services? There are a lot of crypto companies that are also affected by the bear market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;First, there&amp;amp;#39;s Coinbase being &amp;amp;quot;insolvent&amp;amp;quot;. They also slashed 18% of Staff. There&amp;amp;#39;s Crypto.Com laying off over 250 employees which is roughly 5% of its workforce. Gemini also announced reducing 10% of its workforce and BlockFi by 20%. And worst of all, there’s Celsius which just recently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While the majority of crypto companies are joining the firing frenzy, some are not. Binance claimed they have 2000 open posts. This includes data research, communications, business development, and more. Kraken also had openings for 500 positions. They believe that bear markets are the best when it comes to recruiting. FTX also overtook Coinbase in May to become the second-largest centralized crypto exchange by market share.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Aside from the CEXes, there are also DeFi and CeFi services doing well. There&amp;amp;#39;s Nexo only making use of overcollateralized loans, which are by definition sustainable. They are extremely cautious and have no involvement in high-risk DeFi projects which is key to why they survived the bear market.  There&amp;amp;#39;s also Haru Invest which is very different from other CeFi services. They don&amp;amp;#39;t place their customer&amp;amp;#39;s funds in DeFi or other platforms. They have an actual arbitration/trading product that is true and tested. And then there’s also Whalefin landing a major Kit Sponsorship Deal With Spanish Atletico Madrid.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;During bear markets, the bad players are usually weeded out while the good players stay. Such is the case with the crypto services mentioned above.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So with everything that&amp;amp;#39;s happening lately the good and the bad, what do you do with your coins that you probably did or didn&amp;amp;#39;t research but were promised with some good income? Are you going to stake or lend them to these crypto services or do you just HODL? It&amp;amp;#39;s good and it&amp;amp;#39;s safe but you may or may not be missing out on some good returns.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This whole thing is basically just a roller coaster ride and you are in it. There will be good and bad times. It’s up to you if you’ll continue to join the ride. And if you&amp;amp;#39;re trying to time the bottom, just don&amp;amp;#39;t. That maximum damage will come but not today. In fact, nobody really knows how low the price will go. Hell, if people do know, they&amp;amp;#39;d probably be shorting it right now selling everything they have.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

This is ridiculous, getting a good job would be far more beneficial, especially if you have a shitty job and can&amp;amp;#39;t afford to buy much crypto in the first place. And if you are making 25-40k a year you shouldn&amp;amp;#39;t be spending huge chunks of your time looking into or researching crypto. There are people here that claim to have spent hundreds or even thousands of hours on research. And they admit they are also poor... &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Firstly, if you are poor it doesn&amp;amp;#39;t matter how much research you do, if you cant even afford to invest a grand you will never see returns that will even support you for one year. You are far better off spending the hundreds or thousands of hours learning tech that pays, like getting your ccna, or learning how to program or something like that. If you are really that into tech why haven&amp;amp;#39;t you done this? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Secondly let&amp;amp;#39;s say you make 35k a year and decide to learn new skills and net a job that pays 75k a year. Your effort has awarded you an extra 40k a year. Crypto will never bring you those kinds of annual returns (unless you are a big player, but big players have good jobs), especially if you are poor (refer to previous paragraph). &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So for those of you that believe this is the ticket to financial freedom and hate your sub 40k a year job stop looking into crypto right now, get some skills and go get a better job. Then come back.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Let&amp;amp;#39;s take some constant, like &amp;amp;quot;1 meter.&amp;amp;quot; The &amp;amp;quot;meter&amp;amp;quot; is defined as the length of the path travelled by light in a vacuum during a time interval of 1/299,792,458 of a second.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Since the speed of light does not change, the length light travels in that time in a vacuum does not change. Therefore, the meter is an unchanging and permanently fixed constant backed by physics and mathematics, i.e. &amp;amp;quot;1 meter = 1 meter.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If the speed of light were somehow centrally planned and constantly changing (read: inflating), then 1 meter would not be a reliable and we could not measure length effectively. Buildings could not be built and no one would be able to communicate distance. You can substitute the meter with any other mathematical constant to illustrate the same concept.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Similarly, a &amp;amp;quot;bitcoin&amp;amp;quot; can be defined as a single token out of 21 million. Since the cap cannot change, a bitcoin is also a permanently fixed constant backed by physics and cryptography, i.e. &amp;amp;quot;1 btc = 1 btc.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The same cannot be said of the dollar, as it is one unit out of a forever increasing total, centrally planned supply. This is similar to the speed of light always changing, messing with the &amp;amp;quot;meter&amp;amp;quot; definition and our ability to measure. The changing inconsistency of the dollar leads to distortion in &amp;amp;quot;measurements&amp;amp;quot; (read: prices) that is destructive to society - which bitcoin remedies.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is the first constant in the field of economics. The importance of this can hardly be overstated.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;tl;dr: The &amp;amp;quot;1 btc = 1 btc&amp;amp;quot; does NOT mean how much a btc is valued in fiat, nor does it indicate how much a bitcoin can buy, nor is it a tongue-in-cheek tautology. It&amp;amp;#39;s a phrase indicating the fixed, mathematical, physically-tethered nature of bitcoin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;CB Pro is shutting down because CB is in trouble. As far as I can tell CB Pro style trading will be available as Advanced Trade on Coinbase. The fee schedule to buy/sell looks about the same, but not sure what it will end up being by the end of the year. Of course Coinbase Pro, had it continued, could have altered trading fees at any time itself. My biggest concern here is what happens to existing orders and what glitches might I experience if I have any trades or cash or crypto on CB Pro at the time it changes over. This change doesn&amp;amp;#39;t indicate any upcoming bankruptcy. It would be nice to have everything on one platform instead of having to sometimes move stuff between CB and CB Pro. If Advanced Trade sucks or starts charging crazy fees, then that will be a huge deal.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;CB layoffs and rescinding job offers. This happens during poor economic times. People get laid off and job offers are rescinded. It isn&amp;amp;#39;t a good sign for CB, but this is hardly unique to CB. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Hundreds of Millions of $s are leaving CB. People are pulling coins and cash off of exchanges for their own wallets. I think people are realizing it is better to pay gas and transfer fees and in some cases forego staking or lending awards in order to ensure the safety of your crypto. Obviously Celsius and Voyager and others are spurring this on. How much of an impact the removal of crypto from CB will have on CB remains to be seen. CB, allegedly, doesn&amp;amp;#39;t make money lending out crypto so they aren&amp;amp;#39;t losing out on interest from lending out coins. They also thus allegedly don&amp;amp;#39;t have coins at risk that are being lent out. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;CB allegedly temporarily shutting down the US affiliate marketing program. Not sure the reasons for this other than they maybe have decided it isn&amp;amp;#39;t paying off. I&amp;amp;#39;m not really familiar with this program.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;CB Pro USDC trading pairs recently disappeared. Apparently they are merging USDC with USD.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Etc.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Despite the fact that I am unaware of any credible report showing Coinbase is about to go bankrupt, I have moved most of my coins off of ALL CEXs, including CB (Obviously I can&amp;amp;#39;t move my staked ETH). If CB were to ever go bankrupt, nobody knows for sure if they would ever see their crypto again or how much of a warning there would be (would you have enough time to move your coins?). So, do I trust my coins on CB? No. Is it because I think CB is going bankrupt this month or next? No; it is because I don&amp;amp;#39;t trust any CEX and I&amp;amp;#39;d rather keep my own coins in my own wallets. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TL;DR---OP hasn&amp;amp;#39;t seen any credible report that CB is about to go bankrupt. There are a bunch of bankruptcy rumors that might be based on multiple factors, such as current CB layoffs, CB Pro being phased out, etc.  Still, you might want to get your coins off of ALL CEXs to be safe and into your own wallets. OP has moved most of his coins off of all CEXs, including CB.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

And the once in a century kind of bad macro situation with 40 year high inflation (with real data its 70 year peak), has made this arguably the most extraordinary bear market in Crypto yet.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To strengthen this statement, the occasionally used Fear and Greed Index that is meant to show the market sentiment in the crypto markets, has been at &amp;amp;quot;Extreme Fear&amp;amp;quot; territory for now 72 days in a row. That&amp;amp;#39;s the longest period that has EVER happened. And you can clearly see that in the charts too, we did not have any meaningful rally since April.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The markets are in a situation they never been before and on July 28th crypto will see its first recession is history. The coming waters are very uncharted, so be cautious or the whales will eat you up.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In terms of stablecoins failing, cant do much about that.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In terms of where you keep your decentralized currency, that is absolutely your choice.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So before any other exchange falls, understand that by not moving your coins and allowing a centralized company to &amp;amp;quot;hold&amp;amp;quot; them for you, you are consciously accepting the potential loss of said currency.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I know that we all heard about this, but I wanted to leave a reminder of whats possible... An excerpt From Coinbases own quarterly report that ended March 31, 2022. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/a/nJ4ulrO&quot;&amp;gt;https://imgur.com/a/nJ4ulrO&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is NOT a &amp;amp;quot;be careful with Coinbase&amp;amp;quot; post, its a &amp;amp;quot;be careful with ANY centralized exchange&amp;amp;quot; post. I only mention Coinbase because its big but it is not too big to fail.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
