Not sure why it took me so long, and I had my doubts about scalability, but now everything seems so clear.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The lightning network has improved the speed of transactions by using off-network wallets signed by 2 separate parties. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;El Salvador has accepted BTC as legal tender, and other countries will undoubtedly follow as inflation destroys their currencies.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Proof-of-work was created with decentralization and fairness in mind, using math and cryptography. Bitcoin has the largest volume of miners, and was launched in a completely fair way. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Apps like Strike are making Bitcoin payments easy, and cash app and venmo are supporting Bitcoin payments. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Widespread adoption seems inevitable.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Minority of people know anything about it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Check you tube, tik tok, instagram or other social media. But not crypto channels or sites, those are pro crypto bubble, obviously most people there will like it. Check non crypto related ones that randomly mention crypto and you will regret it forever. Knowlege of average person in the internet about crypto is terrifying. Never saw so big amount of ignorance as superstition. Most people think it is fake internet money or biggest scam in history. And those people are not only boomers but millenials or gen z too. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Main argument is that it is a scam, but ofc no one can logically answer why, they act  like medieval peasants toward &amp;amp;quot;witch&amp;amp;quot;. No knowledge, just the same emotional repeated lies that crypto is dangerous, people lose money and my &amp;amp;quot;favourite&amp;amp;quot; that everyone should grow up and  work in 9-5 instead of wasting money and thinking about getting rich... Obviously anyone who invest and want to be successful is wasting time for those people. It is known internet hate any advices of making money, business or self improvement, but even most people that are seeking for bussines ideas, financial freedom and investing advices hate crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Is visiting those places necessary? I think yes. Too many people in crypto space don&amp;amp;#39;t understand real situation and are too optimistic. Some truth will be refreshing  like bucket of ice on their head. Instead of only spending time  in crypto subs or channels you will see reality. Here everything is about crypto, outside not. And even if is usually not friendly at all. I tell it not to complain, get angry or be sad. But to simply understand &amp;amp;quot;the enemy&amp;amp;quot; and stop being ignorant. Nothing better in politics, music or business than meating people that dislike you. To much compliments lead to delusions. Reality check make you improve and become more experienced.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I know a lot of cynics troll these boards either because they are down bad in the market or they just don&amp;amp;#39;t believe in short-term trading. But my process is pretty simple and if you just take a fresh approach you will see that it is possible to extract profits consistently in the market on a regular basis.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Screen altcoins using &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://coinrotator.app&quot;&amp;gt;coinrotator.app&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; advanced settings. Put the Trend streak on 20 +  so you can find coins that have been trending down for at least a month or more. Depending on your risk profile you could even sort by lower market cap (0-100m). If we bounce at all the smaller caps usually bounce the hardest. But as you can see in the current market today, even the big caps are up nicely.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/3x5js3kvkvu81.png?width=503&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=05af8961b481f101a63ecec6b4371fe72dae80aa&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/3x5js3kvkvu81.png?width=503&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=05af8961b481f101a63ecec6b4371fe72dae80aa&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Depending on your broker, head to &amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://ftxpremiums.com/&quot;&amp;gt;ftxpremiums.com&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; or &amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://binancepremiums.com/&quot;&amp;gt;Binancepremiums.com&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and see if the futures funding have been excessively negative for a few days recently. For a less granular view, you can try &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coinglass.com/FundingRate&quot;&amp;gt;Coinglass&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; or &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://coinalyze.net/futures-data/coins/?order_by=fr_avg&amp;amp;amp;order_dir=asc&quot;&amp;gt;Coinanalyze&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. Both are reliable sources for futures funding data.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then it&amp;amp;#39;s important to wait for the market to level off (don&amp;amp;#39;t buy into euphoric spikes). Set an intraday alert for the price to close above the Supertrend. This can be done via Tradingview alerts. I like to use 45 minute charts to establish the next UP trend. Some people prefer the 5 minute, some prefer the 4 hour, it&amp;amp;#39;s really up to you.  The standard Supertrend works fine for setting alerts. My settings are (5 and 1.5) vs the default (10 and 3) that most people use.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/4pv249golvu81.png?width=856&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=2d6d67c99484bf86b9a86fdc77628d5577612c10&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/4pv249golvu81.png?width=856&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=2d6d67c99484bf86b9a86fdc77628d5577612c10&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;If the list is too large to monitor (and on days like today it will be), one further refinement is to check for upcoming news events. For example, now there is a conference in Amsterdam for crypto devs. A lot of positive news has been released since the start. Coins like DUSK and, yes, even MATIC are announcing positive events which will put upside pressure on their coins.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is my oversold setup. I will keep this watchlist for a few days unless BTC crashes, I will be waiting for buy alerts and then consider the overall sentiment of the market (no FED drama, I am a buyer).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Curious to hear others&amp;amp;#39; feedback about how they buy into an uncertain market these days.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;edit: I made a longer post on this topic if you wanted to read more on my approach to buying oversold altcoins. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://coinrotator.medium.com/find-the-most-oversold-altcoins-systematically-e5efac3caab6&quot;&amp;gt;https://coinrotator.medium.com/find-the-most-oversold-altcoins-systematically-e5efac3caab6&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My backup works by converting each word of your seedphrase into its equivalent number using the BIP39 Standard, a static pool of 2048 words. Then you just grab a hammer or mallet and stamp the sequence of numbers into the plate.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Original wordlist: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/english.txt&quot;&amp;gt;https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/english.txt&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So instead of shipping 27 alphabetical stamps I just ship 9 numerical stamps (6=9).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I use AISI 304 Stainless Steel which has a melting point of 1450 °C (2642 °F) so I knew it would not melt, this was rather intended to be an endurance test against high temperature for a long period of time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;***&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyway, so one of my dad&amp;amp;#39;s friends runs a ceramics factory which manufactures Raku (his name is Juan), and he was kind enough to let me put one of my plates in one of the furnaces.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;April 12 at 6:30 am the test had begun&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, the furnace was on. Juan told me the peak temperature was gonna be reached at around 4:30 pm so I went to the factory at that time to photograph the live  furnace and and the thermostat. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Please note that the furnace was turned off at 6:00 pm but remained closed until the next morning at 9:00 am, an extra 15 hours which I do not have the graph for, but it&amp;amp;#39;s safe to say it remained very hot inside the furnace for a good few hours after it was turned off. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/ve4i58e3hyu81.jpg?width=4592&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=69b090de8604e2b4df8e8ff37e6581c48d988e1a&quot;&amp;gt;The live furnace.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;The Aftermath&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;April 13 at 9:00 am the test had concluded&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, the furnace was practically at ambient temperature. The first pic was taken by Juan when they first opened the furnace. I got really anxious because you can barely see any marks on the plates so for a moment I thought they were completely done. I arrived at 11:30 am to the factory only to be surprised by the results.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/vo2s0m5yhyu81.jpg?width=1512&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=16667d2625c92ecb52b997ad7fda3e5a686d39df&quot;&amp;gt;First pic after opening the furnace&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/j4fiobibiyu81.jpg?width=4592&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=cac74ca0890d9a21706ed2196559df1fb48b20a7&quot;&amp;gt;Front and back&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/f6saqvdciyu81.jpg?width=4592&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=3c0094e64ae6af465c823ca6e8ea2493bfeea6bf&quot;&amp;gt;Close up&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/pltszrwciyu81.jpg?width=4592&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=94c821a379f2b35880005c89fbf8adf659578c76&quot;&amp;gt;Macro shot of the stamped numbers&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Result &amp;amp;amp; Conclusions&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The backup data was fully recovered, you can see all the numbers because the steel has almost all of its integrity even after being burned down for half a day.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After carefully reviewing both burned plates and the nature of this benchmark, I came to the conclusion that this test was a total success. I like that this ended up being an extreme endurance test that really shows the strength of the steel.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There&amp;amp;#39;s no secret, if the furnace would have reached a temperature of 1450 °C (2642 &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;°&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;F) both plates would have melted and redeemed irrecoverable. But realistically speaking, in what scenario would these crazy temperatures be reached? The average house fire temperature oscillates between 600 °C  and 800 °C (1100 &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;°&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;F - 1500 &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;°&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;F). &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://firefighterinsider.com/house-fire-temperature-how-hot-does-it-get/&quot;&amp;gt;Source 1&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://jacksonvillesafe.com/2019/07/do-you-know-what-will-not-burn-in-a-house-fire/&quot;&amp;gt;Source 2&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I do not claim to be an expert in house fires but I firmly believe that 12 hours of high temperature is a long amount of time and proves that this grade of steel is suitable for this kind of application.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I would love to hear everyone&amp;amp;#39;s opinion on my test, was it good enough? I do believe it simulates a severe house fire. If you have any cool ideas for other benchmarks against steel!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;If you don&amp;amp;#39;t believe me or don&amp;amp;#39;t get it, I don&amp;amp;#39;t have time to try to convince you, sorry&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Just keep investing, keep trading, keep doing what you think it is the best for you. If people telling you otherwise is bothering you, you may never reach your goal. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Coinbase, Gemini, and Public are just three exchanges I use, and ALL are affected by this (others include Robinhood and Venmo). When you initially make an account with one of these exchanges, they use the third-party company Plaid to connect to your bank account and verify.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Well, Plaid was accessing everyone&amp;amp;#39;s bank info, including transactions, &amp;amp;quot;anonymizing&amp;amp;quot; the data, and selling it. This is what the class action lawsuit is about. Anyone who connected their bank to an exchange or other service using Plaid before November 2021 should file a claim right now, your personal data was illegally sold. Again, you might not even remember it, you did not have to make an account with Plaid, this is just the 20 second process of using them to connect your bank. Over 5,000 apps used Plaid.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is my first time involving myself with a class action lawsuit, it&amp;amp;#39;s actually very easy. If you cannot remember or are unsure what apps used Plaid, first go to &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://my.plaid.com/&quot;&amp;gt;https://my.plaid.com/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and make an account with Plaid. When you make an account, it will tell you what connections associated with your phone number are on file. Click to view that list of connected apps that you&amp;amp;#39;ve used Plaid with.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Next, go to the settlement website: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://plaidsettlement.com/submit-claim.php&quot;&amp;gt;https://plaidsettlement.com/submit-claim.php&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fill out the form, it takes just a minute. On section two, fill out the boxes using information you got from Plaid: Bank account connected/app used (coinbase, gemini, etc)/ and approximate date of connection. Plaid will not give you an exact date, but your best guess should be good enough, anything prior to November of 2021 is valid. At the end, you can select a method to receive your settlement payout. Paypal and direct deposit into your bank are accepted.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Exact payout amounts and dates are not known, but Plaid has had to establish a settlement fund of $58 million to be divided among everyone. I can imagine that the more connections you had, the more you will get.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The final court hearing appears to be set for May 12th. Again, make sure you file your claim before April 28th of THIS MONTH. Get your money from these scummy fucks.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;E: Since there are a lot of comments asking, this is unfortunately for US citizens only, as it is being settled in a US court. A class action suit would need to be filed in your respective countries for action there.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Coffezilla made a youtube video exposing SafeMoon&amp;amp;#39;s billion dollar fraud:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;SafeMoon&amp;amp;#39;s founders and employees are currently being investigated by the FBI, while obviously having commited fraud that is documented on the blockchain and in several recordings. They even admitted deleting evidence on video. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is a fact that SafeMoon is a fraud, several employees said so themselves. There are millions of dollars missing that should be in the liquidity pool and are now in the pockets of safemoons creators. All of it can be looked up by everyone on the blockchain.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yet the safemoon subreddit calls Coffezilla &amp;amp;#39;FUDzilla&amp;amp;#39; and claims he is spreading FUD. Right now they are celebrating for buying the dip... while being 95% down from ATH.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Not everything is FUD. This echo-chamber, cult-like behaviour is sadly quite common in the crypto space, not just with meme coins like SafeMoon. Take care and think for yourself.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Golds market cap risisng from $10T to $25T is a given during a period of high inflation and financial uncertainty, and if investors are allocating the same amount to both gold and bitcoin then theres nothing to stop bitcoins market cap also rising to $25T.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That would mean a 25x rise from this point and price per bitcoin above $1 million.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you play 6 hours a day just to get some profit, that&amp;amp;#39;s not a passive income. That&amp;amp;#39;s called a real ass job. Now I&amp;amp;#39;m not throwing everyone in the same basket, surely some people from developing countries really thrive off these games but for most people in developed countries it&amp;amp;#39;s not a passive income at all.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I mean I would assume the bank would be questioning where this came from or if it’s legal etc if you’re someone who just typically makes like 60k a year lol.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How does that work or what does one do?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Especially cause sometimes coins just skyrocket and people wanna take their profits fast&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
