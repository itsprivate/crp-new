The act of dissolving just days before the collapse of UST suggests the intent to eliminate responsibility of the aftermath, which serves as evidence that he knew something was going to happen. On top of it all, Do Kwon&amp;amp;#39;s Terra foundation sent 52,189 Bitcoin to Gemini and 28,205 Bitcoin to Binance, which were intended to serve as reserves to prop up TerraUSD (UST). So what happened here? This looks like one big premeditated crime to steal 2 billion USD worth of Bitcoin by means of using Terra Luna and UST as the front.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Below is the documentation showing Terraform labs being dissolved just days before the collapse&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The majority of FOMO after all is simply just greed and events like this one should always be a reminder to overcome this feeling.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then there are the people who went all in on memecoins and hype coins and are full blown REKT right now. What did you expect? Its a coin that’s literally backed by &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;hype&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;nothing more.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yet again, events like this bear market should always be a reminded to invest in something that has actual backup.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Look at Ethereum for example. Its down bad but its holding up way better than other coins since it has actual technology and fundamentals. Or even Bitdao. Their price action has been one of the steadiest in the market cause of their massive $2 billion treasury backing them up with hundreds of millions of dollars of stablecoins and ETH.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Let this be a lesson to NEVER invest more than you can afford to lose and focus more on projects with fundamentals and backing rather than hype based coins that will most probably go to zero at the nearest market dip.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The BTC to Dollar exchange rate is being affected by the fact that those who purchased BTC as a speculative asset are moving their money out of BTC back into dollars because they are fearful of a market crash. But your SATS haven&amp;amp;#39;t lost value in compared to the other SATS on the market...they will only go up in time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Crypto is dominated by software engineers who think they are more knowledgeable than they actually are, especially when it comes to fields like economics and finance that are FAAAAR out of their wheelhouse.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Terra&amp;amp;#39;s failure was a failure of economics more than it was a failure of engineering. Even the best software engineers are only as good as their inputs, and they had shitty inputs. They thought they understood supply and demand. They didn&amp;amp;#39;t. They thought they were coming up with something new. They didn&amp;amp;#39;t.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The whole Terra/Luna &amp;amp;quot;mint and burn&amp;amp;quot; mechanism is also known by another name in TradFi: the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deathspiral.asp&quot;&amp;gt;Death Spiral Bond&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. It is such a bad idea that it is only employed by the most desperate of companies because of how easily it can get out of hand. For an industry where innovation and meritocracy are supposedly valued, you&amp;amp;#39;d think someone with even a sliver of influence would have recognized it for what it was and raised warning bells. But describe Terra&amp;amp;#39;s mechanism to a single TradFi financial advisor or analyst, and they will politely decline your business and laugh at you when you walk out the door.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But if you think Terra is the only major crypto project that is deluding itself with overly optimistic assumptions about how economics works, you&amp;amp;#39;ve got another thing coming.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That should give you an idea of just how &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;incredibly&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; immature this industry really is, how little actual expertise is working on these things, and how much all of it is still in the experimental stage, even so-called &amp;amp;quot;blue chips&amp;amp;quot; like Bitcoin and Ethereum.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Even Satoshi was a terrible economist. He thought Bitcoin would make for a good digital cash, and it ended up turning into something no one wants to spend (&amp;amp;quot;HODL!&amp;amp;quot;) because everyone&amp;amp;#39;s too afraid it&amp;amp;#39;ll moon the next day. That makes it an objectively bad currency. And Bitcoiners are not alone in this. If you&amp;amp;#39;ve ever praised &amp;amp;quot;deflationary tokenomics,&amp;amp;quot; you&amp;amp;#39;re guilty of it, too.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Compounding ALL of that is the fact that the crypto industry &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;as a whole&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; is less than 15 years old. Ethereum is barely seven years old. And DeFi is less than two years old. Even the guys who invented Solidity don&amp;amp;#39;t have a decade&amp;amp;#39;s worth of experience in the language.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m not being anti-crypto, I&amp;amp;#39;m just being realistic. I&amp;amp;#39;m still invested (~10% of my liquid net worth) and still DCAing. But fuuuuck, I can&amp;amp;#39;t wait until this community gets its head out of its own ass about how &amp;amp;quot;innovative&amp;amp;quot; crypto is and how it will eat the TradFi industry, and just focus on building good and functional products instead of turning into moral philosophers about economics and politics.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And then people here act surprised and sneer at others for saying they saw it coming. &amp;amp;#39;Hindsight is 20/20&amp;amp;#39; they say, except that&amp;amp;#39;s not true in this case.

I have been following actively the crypto market for 6 years now (Since I was 18 y/o). The first time I heard about bitcoin I was a 12y/o kid who had just heard about the deep web and how Bitcoin was used to pay for assassinations and drugs and child porn and so on…
Fast forwad to 2018 I thought about buying but Bitcoin had already hit 17k (euros) and was at the time at 6 or 7k. I thought to myself “It dropped from 17k to 6k, that’s no good, besides, 7k is still too much”. Then it dropped to 3k and 2k and I  kind of lost interest, and now I regret not buying and Hodling at the time. However today I can see why Bitcoin is and will always be the number one cryptocurrency. I bought my first satoshi at 39k, I bought more earlier today at 29k and will continue buying every month and Hodl it for a very long long time.
Thank you for reading.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

What new users don&amp;amp;#39;t understand is that these people HAVE SEEN SOME SHIT.    &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Imagine living through not just the Terra/Luna meltdown but also witnessing Bitconect, The DAO hack, Mt Gox, and hundreds of shitcoins, rug pulls, ponzis, and exchange hacks. Imagine getting burned yourself (perhaps several times) and then watching it constantly happen to new people. Imagine how every four years, right after the Bitcoin halvening, all these new people show up with their &amp;amp;quot;new toys&amp;amp;quot;. (2013 alt coins, 2017 icos, 2021 NFTs) and zero experience and stubbornness and watch as they completely ignore the advice from people who have spent years in this space.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitcoin is just different. There is no leader. There is no premine. There is no changing the finite supply or the economic properties. Its real decentralized money and the reason we even understand the word &amp;amp;quot;blockchain&amp;amp;quot; today.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here&amp;amp;#39;s to all the new Bitcoin maxis that will be born during this crypto winter. May you be toxic af and may you do a better job protecting new retail investors than the SEC ever has.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TL;DR: Take your ALGO off exchanges unless you are actively trading. June 5 is the target &amp;amp;quot;date&amp;amp;quot; of the ALGOrun, but really this an ongoing affair. This is good for decentralization of the ALGO chain.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Not long ago, our brethren in Monero staged the Monerun. It was a fantastic move and we applaud you. Also, we are saddened by the news that you all collectively took a boat trip to celebrate and then all lost your keys in a tragic accident. Truly heartbreaking.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyway, like the folks at XMR, we at ALGO are also concerned about fractional reserve trading. But, even more pressing is the issue of exchanges having too much control in our governance program. They pledge your ALGO, then vote them how they see fit. They pocket the rewards and pass scraps on to you. We are fighting back and taking control.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So far, the effort at an ALGOrun has been confined to our little community over at &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/algorand&quot;&amp;gt;r/algorand&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. In that time, we have nonetheless managed to sack two of Binance&amp;amp;#39;s cold wallets and make them forfeit a total of over 154M ALGO from Governance.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is time to spread the word: #weALGOoffexchanges.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What we are trying to accomplish is a run on the exchanges that forces them to forfeit their governance rewards (return more power to holders) or buy OTC to defend their governance position. So, we are now officially on an ALGOrun. From now until &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;June 5th&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, we are pressing all our folks to go off exchanges unless they are actively trading. We have made a stockpile of memes and educational material. We will force every damn exchange we can to quit governance and return control to the Algonauts.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;So...What is the idea here?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Answer: We try to push exchanges out of governance and/or buy ALGO over the counter (OTC) to cover their position. At least 500M Algos in governance belong to exchanges. That means exchanges are voting on governance proposals how they see fit and pocketing the rewards. People don&amp;amp;#39;t realize they can get the same or WAY better rewards on a private wallet that is pledged in governance and actually be able to make their own choices on how Algorand goes forward.. The exchanges have wagered that many Algonauts will remain ignorant of this fact. It is time to we expose this.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Wait, are you saying this is like a short squeeze?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yes. Wallets that pledge and then vote in governance get rewards. Exchanges are using your Algo to do this. They are voting for you (and it may not be a vote that is in your interest) and then pocketing the rewards. They pass on only a portion of it to you. If we withdraw from the exchanges, they will be faced with two options: (1) forfeit governance rewards, which can be millions of dollars; or (2) go buy ALGOs over the counter and drive the price up.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;But can&amp;amp;#39;t the exchanges just freeze withdraws?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yes they can, and many already have. But just keep up with it and withdraw. In the past two days we&amp;amp;#39;ve sacked 154M ALGO from Binance. They had to halt withdrawals while they recharged their hot wallet. First they forfeited 64M Algos from governance. Then they reopened withdrawals. And then, they had to forfeit another 94M.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Why June 5th?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anniversary of the launch of Algorand main net!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Won&amp;amp;#39;t people just front run June 5th? Should I pull my funds sooner than that?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sure. They might. And, you don&amp;amp;#39;t need to wait to withdraw. This is an ongoing movement. June 5 is just an arbitrary day for peak activity if possible. And this isn&amp;amp;#39;t just about price. It&amp;amp;#39;s about decentralization and ensuring people have the power to vote their own ALGO and receive all the rewards for it, to participate in the ecosystem, etc.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Can&amp;amp;#39;t exchanges just frontrun this event too? Stock up on ALGO to avoid forfeiting governance?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sure. If they want to buy ALGO and drive price up, more power to them. The point is to either make them forfeit governance or to make them buy more ALGO. If we are relentless enough, we can make them do both.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Don&amp;amp;#39;t exchanges do this with other coins too?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yes. I have no idea if those other coins have the same economic incentives for exchanges to try to defend their cold wallet positions. But, if you want to do your own &amp;amp;quot;[coin]Run&amp;amp;quot;, you can feel free to do so. I&amp;amp;#39;ll promote that too. We have made a ton of content that you can crib from. This isn&amp;amp;#39;t a coin vs coin battle. This is a people vs institutions battle. We are all on the same side here.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you are interested in contributing to content or seeing the content we have made so far, we have posted a lot of content over at &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/algorand&quot;&amp;gt;r/algorand&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. I refrain from posting it here for fear of  automod. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;From henceforth, the ALGOrun is officially on.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My opinions on this :&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The proposal assumes that luna and UST still has value.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There doesn’t seem to be any actual fix to the protocol, this is basically just resetting the chain to a more convenient state.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;No mention on how to fix UST. I mean he said to push the fix later, but the counter argument is that the dynamics UST with LUNA is what defines terra, without that terra is just a PoS like avax or Polygon.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

If someone doesn’t have to do anything to receive an airdrop, they won’t have to pay income tax on it. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Do you believe that this new rule will make life easier for a crypto investor?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That upward swing was never meant to last, and the deeper we go into the red the more desperate people become and those with weaker hands will inevitably sell while on the red and want to blame it on someone, anyone but themselves, and I guess a celebrity like Matt makes for a good scapegoat.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Which is a shame, because there&amp;amp;#39;s so many celebrities actually scamming people, yet Matt only did an ad for an actual exchange, but that&amp;amp;#39;s just how people are.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Remember, your investments are 100% your choice, and thus your fault. Both the red and the green.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

While most users don&amp;amp;#39;t see this spam due to our bots removing it, this affects our governance token by lowering the ratio as well as the cap, governance is meant to be distributed proportionally to users that contributes to the subreddit, not to bots/shills/scammers. Moderators also have a really hard time catching these users since bots automatically remove their posts/comments.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Removing &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;vaultless&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; users with less than 10 karma from the snapshot and distribution.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Pro: Higher ratio and karma cap for contributors and more governance available to vote &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hey hey hey everybody my name is Do Kwon and I am coming from Korea and let me tell you guys that I am so excited, I am so happy, I am really so thrilled to be right now sharing this amazing, glorious, super, and exciting moment of my life with all of you guys, and let me tell you that we are really changing the world as we know it, the world is not anymore the way it used to be, mmm mmm, No! No! No! TERRACONNECT!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Wow! TERRACONNECT! We are coming and we are coming in waves! We are starting and we are watching go all over the world! We are pelting the entire world! Let me tell you guys that I started 137 days ago with only $25,610 and right now I am earning 20% guaranteed yield! Woah woah woah woah woah woah woah Whats up? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And let me tell you that I am actually earning around one hun- I mean $1,400 on an every day basis, seven days a week! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What? I am right now independently, financially independently. I am saying to so many people who say that this was going to be con artist game, that this was gonna be a scammer game, “Hey! You’re gonna lose all your money!” My wife still doesn’t believe in me! I’m telling him “Oh honey, this is real!” “Oh no no no no no, that’s a scam!” And I said “But wait I’m gonna go to the bank and I’m gonna get my UST and I’m actually gonna turn it into dollars, here there right on the table!” “No, that’s money you took from another account!” And I’ll say “What am I gonna do? Then I said to myself, “You know what? When I am starting to put $10,000 a day on her, right on her, you know on her table.” Then she’s gonna say “Woah!” Hahaha! Yo yo yo yo yo! “OK that’s real!” Hahahaha! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So guys, I’m gonna tell you something. Faith and believe is the one thing that we will need to be able to change the world, and right now I believe that in this room, we have the seed that’s gonna germinate and is going to explode into an amazing opportunity for us to change this entire world. I am so proud, I am so honored, I am so excited to be here right now and let me tell you something, that each and every one of you has the opportunity to become like those amazing people that we know here from Vietnam.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hey hey! My group from Vietnam! Making so much money that it could probably that could probably have a real hard time counting it! Ha ha ha ha ha ha! So guys, let me tell you, I love, TERRRRAACONNEEEECT!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Doing a rollback back to 3 or 4 days ago does not solve ANYTHING it just hurts even more. The legal implications of that would be gigantic, too.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I am actually debating, if I should by some coins just to have funny legal battle if they actually follow through with that.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
