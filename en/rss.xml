What they can do is swapping a shitcoin for another shitcoin or staking to gain more shitcoins. How crypto market isn’t just a large online betting site when everything gain value from short time speculation and manipulation. When the price hasn&amp;amp;#39;t really been correlated with the quality of the product. It&amp;amp;#39;s just all the hype. Many crypto holders have not even transferred their coins out of an exchange ever.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TBH, the longer I’m in the crypto market the less I&amp;amp;#39;m leaning toward crypto and the more I lost hope in the community. Aren’t this community consisted of a bunch of greedy, naive, clueless people and a few scam artists who will get rich.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Bi-partisan crypto bill&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; by the GOP&amp;amp;#39;s Cynthia Lummis and the Democrat&amp;amp;#39;s Kristen Gillinbrand (this is a person who voted against bailing out Wall Street &amp;amp;amp; banks circa 2008). The bill should be out this month, but probably won&amp;amp;#39;t get a vote until the 118th Congress begins next year. My belief is that after regulatory clarity, bitcoin will absorb TradFi and trust rapidly. Governments won&amp;amp;#39;t be able to control programmable money like this and it will run wild. Anything unfavorable in any bills will get programmed around and that&amp;amp;#39;ll be a wrap&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Taproot Support.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Praise the lord, because we already have 75%+ nodes supporting it, and Taproot addresses, signatures, and scripting are necessary to unleash the security and innovation we need to begin onboarding institutions, governments, and individuals en masse&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;TARO&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; (taproot asset representation overlay). This means stablecoins, products, services, NFT collectibles, tokenized securities, and anything else that you can assign value. It&amp;amp;#39;s difficult to stress the absurd liquidity and power this can bring the Bitcoin Network. All of this stuff will ultimately get settled in bitcoin. Why? Because bitcoin is a payment network that only bitcoin travels on. Meaning anything built on or traveling above bitcoin&amp;amp;#39;s base layer gets settled in BTC. This is how we &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;bitcoinize the dollar&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; flipping the dynamic we&amp;amp;#39;re so accustomed to on exchanges, where bitcoin is settled in US dollars. This will fire a major shot across the bow spurning a circular economy war. TARO is also cool because the upgrade to wallets is so minimal. Of course none of this is good news for centralized exchanges&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The Merge&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. This will set that protocol rapidly on its path towards centralization and self-immolation. Liquid staking derivative platforms will within 1 year acquire the network effects and stakes necessary to capture over 50% of the network and control it forever unless hard-forked, creating several problems itself because of L2, bridges, and sidechains obviously. If it&amp;amp;#39;s not a single platform acquiring the network, it will be two of them colluding. The decentralized autonomous organizations that run these platforms are made of TradFi and erstwhile hegemons. Expect them to utilize carry trades (low interest cash borrowing), use it to buy the crypto, stake it, and use their staking derivatives to short the crypto, creating near delta-neutral positioning. Remember, if you&amp;amp;#39;re not staking, you&amp;amp;#39;re being diluted by whatever the staking APY is. I suspect this inflation will match the USD&amp;amp;#39;s traditionally (4% or so). Just another reason why fixed monetary policy (bitcoin) and PoW are important&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;SEC regulation&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;: this means securities designations for much of the space which will damage centralized exchanges as much as VC&amp;amp;#39;s and (expletive)coins themselves. This is the s-curve adoption shakeout we bitcoiners have been warning about. It will help end the above system we talked about even faster&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Full-blown LiFi&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; (Lightning Finance). If I can send you bitcoin and you get stablecoins on the other end; or you send someone stablecoins and they get milk, then you can see how most people using the Bitcoin Network won&amp;amp;#39;t know they&amp;amp;#39;re using the network. They won&amp;amp;#39;t see or understand what&amp;amp;#39;s happening in the background anymore than they do Visa when buying a concert ticket, or HTTP when clicking through a website. You don&amp;amp;#39;t have to price things at the store in sats people. It doesn&amp;amp;#39;t matter what they&amp;amp;#39;re priced in. I can see several payment processors bypassing traditional discrete payment networks (like Visa or PayPal) and leveraging the LN. I expect banks, the traditional payment networks themselves, and even governments to use it. One major chartered bank is already in talks to issue fiat (not stablecoins, but digital fiat) on the LN. It&amp;amp;#39;s pretty cool to know the LN will connect everybody in the world, and to get started all that&amp;amp;#39;s needed is downloading a free wallet&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Hyperinflation.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; It&amp;amp;#39;s unavoidable. We&amp;amp;#39;re at the end of the debt cycle. The USD is trapped. You can&amp;amp;#39;t raise interest rates enough because the debt is too high (over $30T) making the interest paid too high. Foreign demand for Treasuries peaked years ago. Supply chains are broken, many for the rest of this decade. Energy inputs can&amp;amp;#39;t be reigned in, not just because of sanctions which cause an immediate impact, but because even when those are gone, the chronic underinvestment in exploration/extraction will take years to fix with proper investment (even if we made a sweetheart deal with Venezuela). And lastly, inflation is high everywhere you look. This is what Robert Triffin predicted back in the 1960s for an inflationary world reserve currency--an eventual doom vortex when the currency got trapped between low rates, inflation, debt, and falling foreign demand. Several countries have currencies which are more volatile than BTC is (Turkey, Iran, Argentina, Cuba, much of Africa, etcetera). Is Japan next? What I know is it&amp;amp;#39;s climbing the ladder, and when BTC is more stable than major currency pairs are, with longterm bias to the upside, we&amp;amp;#39;ll see a credit market rapidly develop around bitcoin collateral globally. Point is, the capital flight release valve in a hyper event is pretty obvious: Bitcoin. The USD isn&amp;amp;#39;t going away just yet, but stopping inflation doesn&amp;amp;#39;t mean prices go down, it simply means prices stop going up. Thankfully BTC will be there to do whatever you need it to do: issue new assets, collateralize, lend, borrow, save, send, or spend. The new global reserve asset&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Seriously though, this shit is going to disappear into the internet stack. And the sooner we&amp;amp;#39;re the internet of money, the sooner the price becomes apparent:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;∞/21M&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Conclusion: HODL. BUY. REPEAT.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As you guys know the worse consecutive red weekly candles happened from August to September of 2014. I&amp;amp;#39;ve skimmed through the weekly chart and there are a lot of 4 consecutive red candles btw.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The ponzi slowly unravelled during the Great Recession when investors started to want to withdraw funds, he wasnt able to keep up with the withdraw requests as he was now lacking funds. He eventually told his sons. They then reported it to the feds. He was then sentenced to 150 years in prison. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Whereas, in 2022, Do Kwon lost investors around 60billion (Luna and UST combined market value). And instead of answering questions/investigations or serving time. He created Luna 2.0 &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It baffles me how he has the guts/audacity to launch Lunacy two point zero. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For old luna bag holders / new comers thinking on “investing” on lunacy 2.0, I will leave you with a quote to think about.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“Fool me once , shame on you. 
                          Fool me twice, shame on me”  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now I wonder if Do will ever see jail time? As south korean authorities are conducting investigations with regards to the collapse of both ust and luna. Plus allegations that Terraform Labs is being used to move/launder money.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/newyork/press-releases/2009/nyfo062909.htm&quot;&amp;gt;Madoff 150 yr sentence fbi archives link&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;IMO, Luna 2.0 is a spit on the face to the unlucky ones who got duped by the “stablecoin” and a somewhat “conservative” 20% apy combo. The 20% is what I call “Good , but not that good to NOT be true” the perfect bait&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Only real investors with conviction in the tech or price action or whatever are remaining.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Such drastic declines in New investors who just hold for a few months are very good because the market is now getting settled up for the next leg upwards and is making space for those hype investors to once again return and buy at the ATH.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Currently only we are remaining here and if you made it this far you can definitely call yourself a long-term investor and also a Crypto Citizen. It definitely was not easy to come this far and you should not give up after coming this far too.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I wanted to see if AI could replace traders by running a small (and maybe a costly) experiment.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Rules are simple. For the next week, I’ll long/short Bitcoin based on an &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/predictBTC&quot;&amp;gt;AI twitter bot&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#39;s forecasts. Every position will be opened at 00:00 UTC and closed at 23:59 UTC.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Our start balance is $1000. And we won’t use leverage in our trades.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Day 1/7: Great start?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/u0cbdnzg1n391.png?width=537&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=dd02d5ade8d842836c3e8849d98f1dc0a4b2fbf9&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/u0cbdnzg1n391.png?width=537&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=dd02d5ade8d842836c3e8849d98f1dc0a4b2fbf9&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/klmq40rr1n391.png?width=664&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e2a6715f19fd7f0301bfffe75decbff1d0643ae2&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/klmq40rr1n391.png?width=664&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e2a6715f19fd7f0301bfffe75decbff1d0643ae2&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The bot&amp;amp;#39;s forecast was barely bearish. We opened a short position at $29.5K (when the forecast was tweeted) and closed it at $29K (at the end of the day). We ended up with a profit of $17. This brings our final balance to $1017. Probably luck. We will see by the end of this experiment.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Day 2/7: Sometime it happens&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/30lwoo8n2n391.png?width=542&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=93946c2f5e9a027da1144dcb3c3be2a63ac6874a&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/30lwoo8n2n391.png?width=542&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=93946c2f5e9a027da1144dcb3c3be2a63ac6874a&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This time I couldn&amp;amp;#39;t really tell if the bot was bullish or bearish, so I didn&amp;amp;#39;t open any positions that day.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Day 3/7: Two wins in a row?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/5xo4bk0a3n391.png?width=536&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=4e187438ffd3548059e3ae1151b714822a98ecec&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/5xo4bk0a3n391.png?width=536&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=4e187438ffd3548059e3ae1151b714822a98ecec&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here, the forecast was clearly bullish. Time to long. We opened a long position at $28.6K (when the forecast was tweeted) and closed it at $29K (at the end of the day). We ended up with a profit of $14. This brings our final balance to $1031. Two wins in a row baby!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Day 4/7: THREE wins in a row?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/k20ww8gx3n391.png?width=660&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e070877ad3a2d91043e0923f900674eef55f6f70&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/k20ww8gx3n391.png?width=660&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e070877ad3a2d91043e0923f900674eef55f6f70&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is our luckiest day yet (I really hope this continues). We longed at $29K and closed the position at $30.3K, ending up with a profit of $46. This brings our final balance to $1077.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Day 5/7: I knew it&amp;amp;#39;d happen&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/vo927hr55n391.png?width=533&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=86edac09d9330d4d0e687bba7da8b506371cb5ec&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/vo927hr55n391.png?width=533&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=86edac09d9330d4d0e687bba7da8b506371cb5ec&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/c1syxmx65n391.png?width=682&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=06ae1a81129a4401adc2a9a852998ebb296dfb56&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/c1syxmx65n391.png?width=682&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=06ae1a81129a4401adc2a9a852998ebb296dfb56&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here, the bot seemed neutral and bearish at the same time, so short it is. We opened a short position at $29.5K and closed it at $31.8K (at the end of the day). We ended up with a loss of $84. We&amp;amp;#39;ve successfully wiped all of our previous profits, bringing our final balance to $993. Yay!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Day 6:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/z7jquj3a6n391.png?width=537&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=7fd0c60c3bd889b2e03c21a9c7a5aa5c271e7f7c&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/z7jquj3a6n391.png?width=537&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=7fd0c60c3bd889b2e03c21a9c7a5aa5c271e7f7c&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here, the bot seemed neutral, and its confidence was slightly high, so we didn&amp;amp;#39;t end up opening any positions that day.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Day 7/7: Comeback or Horrible Fail?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/oc5tysfj7n391.png?width=543&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=0627a3744df61afd0633595193f01418106edaca&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/oc5tysfj7n391.png?width=543&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=0627a3744df61afd0633595193f01418106edaca&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/nnn66avk7n391.png?width=667&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e06653510c139ff7d5f5a65f5a51c8e21d37ae32&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/nnn66avk7n391.png?width=667&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e06653510c139ff7d5f5a65f5a51c8e21d37ae32&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Ah yes. Nothing goes up forever. The bot here was barely bullish, so I ended up longing. Big mistake. We longed at $31.8K (when the forecast was tweeted) and closed it at $29.7K (at the end of the day). We ended up with a loss of $66.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Summary&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;We won three trades and lost two. Our win rate seems to be 60%.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;We won a total of $77 and lost $150. Finishing up with a total loss of $73.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Of course, five trades aren’t enough to evaluate any trading strategy. The bot seemed to do well initially, but then the market started crashing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This small experiment shows that the crypto market is genuinely unpredictable. Not even by a shitty AI Twitter bot that made me lose $73, which probably flips a coin to generate random predictions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;Http://wenmerge.com&quot;&amp;gt;Http://wenmerge.com&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And in an as yet unspecified date in august, the real main net merge will happen.  So why am I so bullish about the merge?  Its largely Eth moving instantly from 3.3% inflation to -0.7% inflation. But it&amp;amp;#39;s also these. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;99% reduction in energy cost per Tx. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;90% issuance reduction.  12500 eth a day to 1250. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Miner sell pressure drops from 14,000 eth a day to 0. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;More eth locked in the staking contract for 6 months after the merge . &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Deflationary asset.  More eth burned than produced if gwei &amp;amp;gt;20gwei.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Number 3 is I think the most important. While it wont drop to exactly 0 on the first night, removing $30 million of sell pressure per day will have a massive effect.  The market would need to refind this pressure just to stop the price going up. (Its guaranteed profit). It wont find this sell pressure.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There won&amp;amp;#39;t be a &amp;amp;#39;massive selloff&amp;amp;#39; on merge night.  All eth remains locked into the contract until the next update.  After that, there is a queued release. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I believe that both Bitcoin and Ethereum are stores of value,  but Ethereum is currently also the worlds largest and most secure crypto network.  It is the foundation of web3.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As a final note, it took 19 months to get 12.6 million into the deposit contract.   In the last 2 months alone,  2.6 million of that amount was deposited.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As a final final note, I&amp;amp;#39;d like to thank Do Kwon for causing the luna crash and allowing us to buy Eth this cheap, this close to the merge.  And also removing luna from the market and allowing Ethereum more room to grow in MC.  You&amp;amp;#39;re a bastard, make no mistake; but you&amp;amp;#39;re a magnificent one.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

It keeps weathering storms and coming back, and it&amp;amp;#39;s the most truly decentralized coin I know. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All the recent stuff with LUNA has also swayed me toward BTC.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I don&amp;amp;#39;t think I will ever be a pure 100% BTC maxi. I invest in BTC, ETH, and the Cosmos ecosystem, but the percentage of BTC in my portfolio continues to grow (about 75% now), and it&amp;amp;#39;s the one I feel most secure investing in.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I know I may lose out on some coins that go to the moon far more quickly, but I&amp;amp;#39;ll also miss out on the many more coins that promise the moon yet hardly make it off the launching pad.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If we match the 2017 drawdowns for BTC and ETH, it&amp;amp;#39;s 85% and 95% respectively, then we are looking at levels of $10k BTC and $250 for ETH. 
It might seem highly unlikely, but the market is surely reflecting some fear of this happening.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto exchanges halting new hirings,even cutting the current staff, miners selling their stacks to cover up for the expenses could be the some of the signs you are looking for. 
Even the rest of the financial markets are not doing good, fearing a recession might be coming. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Overall, the picture of market is still negative.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Just look at this sub, a month ago even during that massive downturn we still had some discussions. The new posts page is a straight up cemetery, beyond a couple news articles that gets posted there&amp;amp;#39;s nothing.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is the start of winter, the crypto winter that is. This is the time that will test those that truly believe and are staying and averaging in until the next bull market. If you can manage to hold on, and it won&amp;amp;#39;t be easy you may just have what it takes to quit a regular job and live financially free. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;None of that &amp;amp;#39; financial freedom &amp;amp;#39; stuff is of course guaranteed, but the people that have made it in this market are the ones that planned and stayed. If you can ignore your emotions, you can secure financial promotions!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The most important part is to always have a plan. A lot of people follow the HODL strat and “I’m never gonna sell it’ll go back up again” mentality. It makes sense, it’s a good strategy but please be aware of what can happen.
Let me give you an example.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;The 2017 Incident&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Imagine you bought around the ATH in 2017. 10-16.000$ back then. After 2017 a bear market hit. And it was a brutal one for the mentality of a lot of investors. -80% investment &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;on BITCOIN&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; not just alts. And this wasn’t happening in a couple months it happened over years.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fast foreword it’s 2019 and BTC is currently at 9k again. You hope for a new ATH to cut your losses or at least break even and what happens? It goes back down again. It’s 2020 and BTC is still at 9000$. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;It’s been nearly 3 years now&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; since you bought BTC and your portfolio was always in a loss. And now Covid happens. BTC falls towards 5000$. All that with the years of mentality “Will it ever hit 10-16k again?”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you managed to even hold through that time after 4 years you finally get rewarded. The next big bullrun hits and it was the biggest that ever happen. In a matter of weeks BTC doubles. After that it doubles every couple weeks. New all time highs every week reaching up to 60k+&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you managed to HODL through those years congratulations you just 6-8x your initial investment. I’ve been through this time and I can promise you the majority of people with that HODL mentality gave up and sold eventually. It’s rough and not as easy as a lot of people think.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I double checked the white paper and looks like the full mint and burn mechanism wont be implemented until November. Until USDD can be burned for newly minted TRX there is 0 chance of a failed mint and burn scenario similar to Terra / UST&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Just pulled up the white paper for USDD. Seems that the &amp;amp;quot;stability&amp;amp;quot; mechanism for USDD is the exact same as UST.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here&amp;amp;#39;s the white paper so you can read for yourself &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://usdd.io/USDD-en.pdf&quot;&amp;gt;https://usdd.io/USDD-en.pdf&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Page 3 and 4 show very plainly what the mint and burn mechanism is. You don&amp;amp;#39;t have to know much about any of this to understand it. Simply 1 USDD can be burned for $1 equivalent of TRX minted. $1 worth of TRX can be burned for 1 USDD minted.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Looks like right now USDD borrow rates on &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://justlend.org&quot;&amp;gt;justlend.org&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; are 5%&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So if you want to short USDD with leverage here&amp;amp;#39;s how to do it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Deposit collateral on &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://justlend.org&quot;&amp;gt;justlend.org&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; - Eth, BTC, USDC take your pick&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Borrow USDD&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Immediately sell USDD for more collateral&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Deposit collateral&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Repeat steps 2 and 3 depending on how much leverage you want exposure too&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The loan to value ratio on justlend will determine how many times you can repeat this process. Each time you repeat steps 2 and 3 you increase your leverage. So at 10x leverage every 1% move in either direction is a 10% gain or loss. You&amp;amp;#39;ll want to figure out what the liquidation threshold is so you don&amp;amp;#39;t lose your collateral.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some of the more obvious risks in this trade are the APY you pay on borrowed USDD, not managing your collateral and getting liquidated, and also maybe a not so obvious one is since justlend runs on tron, its worthwihile to think about if USDD and TRX fail will Tron shutdown? In the event of a network shutdown you wont be able to repay your USDD and release your collateral.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There&amp;amp;#39;s also a much easier way to short Tron and USDD in the event of a failure of the mint and burn mechanism. Just set an alert (or program a script if your savvy enough) and short TRX on a centralized exchange like Kucoin if USDD depegs to $0.97 then short TRX with leverage in your margin account. I&amp;amp;#39;m sure you can find TRX perpetuals on other exchanges too if you want to increase your leverage. Then if USDD repegs you close the trade. Rinse and repeat every time USDD depegs.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Many crypto critics charge that the whole space is an elaborate ponzi scheme, and a zero sum greater fools game. This is due to the fact that they narrowly define &amp;amp;quot;utility&amp;amp;quot;. The truth is, as soon as there is a secondary liquid market for a cryptocurrency or blockchain and its native asset, it becomes a utility in the real world because it offers the transmission and manipulation of real world value. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here is the revised diagram, and my point in summary:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/3b3y9dtrnb391.png?width=2252&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=1b3f31899487a26f35ce3ffc7e547ac57e2b6630&quot;&amp;gt;Blockchains are not zero sum&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You will see that in addition to investors cashing out, the security fee is the other leak of accrued value in a blockchain. I posted earlier an &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/v0j27u/a_coherent_investment_thesis_looking_forward_to/&quot;&amp;gt;investment thesis&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; where I mentioned how to fundamentally value crypto, or at least the rough framework I use. It is important to realize &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;that most blockchains pay more in security costs than the transaction fees they receive from use&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. This means they ARE essentially zero sum most of the time. Only a few are not, and that is essentially Ethereum and its roll ups, though other modular PoS chains can eventually achieve the steady state of paying for security outright without diluting holders.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

And yet again it was attacked YET AGAIN recently! If traditional banking was this flakey the government would haul it over the coals and watch it burn.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yet people still invest in this centralized chain.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Litecoin for example (and I am sure there are many other examples that people can name) has had 100 percent uptime with literally no hacks or exploits, yet people instantly dismiss.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It brings me to the conclusion that we don&amp;amp;#39;t really care about fundamentals in the crypto space, only juicy profits. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So it brings me back to the original point of this post, why an earth are people investing in SOL when it is the least secure and reliable chain in crypto?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
