&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Winter came and as you know, prices keep falling and falling.. I was getting worried, not for my personnal stash, but for my dear fragile mom. What if she decided to check the price today? &amp;amp;quot;Nah, she will not look, she never look&amp;amp;quot; I said to myself... But guilt was hanging over my head. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Today, I&amp;amp;#39;ve had enough, i&amp;amp;#39;ve pulled the plug. I took a 2000$ personnal loan at 12% interest and transfered the total cash amount to her checking account. &amp;amp;quot;Yeah mom, Bitcoin is down, but I&amp;amp;#39;ve sold it before, hehe!!  Sorry it didn&amp;amp;#39;t went up, here&amp;amp;#39;s your investment. Love you, mom&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thats all you need to remember. The rest is noise. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yes politics may come and go, different ideas may be thrown around, but don’t for one moment think that if there is money to be made, they will let that chance slide.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Regulations may come and you will probably have to kyc more regularly or in a more specific way.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But banning crypto has proved to be basically impossible. And at this point i don’t even slightly consider it an option and neither should you.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Instead, turn of the bullshit news (because it always is absolute bullshit) and just look for nice price points to get more of your favorite coin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then over a couple of years, look back and enjoy.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Every once in awhile I see the &amp;amp;quot;should I tell the wife&amp;amp;quot; posts and ...idk...So...that got me thinking how much does she know? Or for the other 3 ladies and few gents with husbands in here does &amp;amp;quot;he&amp;amp;quot; know? It&amp;amp;#39;s bad enough I&amp;amp;#39;m on my phone in the middle of the night checking things...he&amp;amp;#39;d probably be grateful if it was porn but nope...I&amp;amp;#39;m such a nerd crypto is my side piece. Thoughts?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TLDR - Does you SO know how much you&amp;amp;#39;ve spent/made in crypto? You gonna tell them?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: So, our relationship is good, 23 yrs strong.  We are financially sound and own everything. I&amp;amp;#39;m talking less than 10k. The post was brought on by the downturn where I&amp;amp;#39;m down about 40% and it&amp;amp;#39;s more about being perceived as making a bad investment decision and not wanting to talk about it. I&amp;amp;#39;m not hiding it but he hasn&amp;amp;#39;t asked and I&amp;amp;#39;m not bringing it up. BTW, he&amp;amp;#39;s not perfect either. I&amp;amp;#39;ve also seen a lot of &amp;amp;quot;should I tell the wife&amp;amp;quot; questions and that&amp;amp;#39;s why I asked where everyone&amp;amp;#39;s at ...pure curiosity.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But is this the place where you need to shill your favourite political party and share the same overused &amp;amp;quot;this party bad, this party good&amp;amp;quot; rhetorics? No. There are so many of us that don&amp;amp;#39;t give an absolute donkey&amp;amp;#39;s ass about why you think one party is better than the other.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;By all means, it is important that many of these topics within the political sphere are discussed and opposed when they threaten the future of our financial independence, freedom of information, etc.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But really, it gets old fast when you all inject your political views into things. If you&amp;amp;#39;re going to constantly look for reasons to hate on a political party,  but not actually address the underlying REASONS both parties are equally corrupt when discussing crypto, you&amp;amp;#39;re not helping the issue, you&amp;amp;#39;re &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;part&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; of it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Just another bought politician sneaking in a &amp;amp;quot;small&amp;amp;quot; hidden provision in a large bill.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto lobbying groups are worried about a specific provision proposed by Rep. Jim Himes, buried around page 1,482 of the almost-3,000-page bill, that would allow the Treasury Department to bypass certain checks to take &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/5318A&quot;&amp;gt;“special measures”&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; to surveil, condition or prohibit any transactions deemed of concern to U.S. interests. The provision, titled “Prohibitions or Conditions on Certain Transmittal of Funds,” also expands the department’s authority to include crypto exchanges and transactions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So these CBDC&amp;amp;#39;s will be really bad news.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I went through the last proposal so you didn&amp;amp;#39;t have to.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TLDR:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In short, they want unilateral power over money and to maintain control of global economies. They also fear Russia China and others are using crypto to skirt sanctions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They want complete control to spy and freeze funds in everyones accounts&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;edit clarification: the top are screenshots from the CBDC proposal, they are eerily similar to the America Competes law listed below. One can deduce that with the power and flexibility of CBDC&amp;amp;#39;s they will give the treasury unilateral power&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you stack this with the  America COMPETES Act of 2022 which gives the TReasury &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;unchecked and unilateral power to spy and halt or limit accounts and transactions.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here are some screen shots&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Lastly Biden will be using an executive order to provision and issue crypto rules next month&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This will be done under the banner of national security&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.barrons.com/articles/white-house-executive-action-regulate-cryptos-national-security-51643312454&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.barrons.com/articles/white-house-executive-action-regulate-cryptos-national-security-51643312454&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;An executive order is a signed, written, and published directive from the President of the United States that manages operations of the federal government.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Executive orders are not legislation; they require no approval from Congress, and Congress cannot simply overturn them. Congress may pass legislation that might make it difficult, or even impossible, to carry out the order, such as removing funding. Only a sitting U.S. President may overturn an existing executive order by issuing another executive order to that effect.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.americanbar.org/groups/public_education/publications/teaching-legal-docs/what-is-an-executive-order-/&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.americanbar.org/groups/public_education/publications/teaching-legal-docs/what-is-an-executive-order-/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Personally I hope this goes all the way to the Supreme court as this is a gross violation of the 4th amendment &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How can the spot ETF suffer from manipulation risk when the SEC themselves allowed the futures ETF which according to them doesnt suffer from manipulation? Both of them are the same market. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Lets say US retail and institutions, who the SEC wants to protect, have invested in BITO.. and over the weekend when BITO isn&amp;amp;#39;t traded, someone unknown to the market borrows a ton of money and also dumps million BTC on Bitfinex and crashes the price. Manipulation.. probably? But it doesn&amp;amp;#39;t make BITO free from manipulation, on Monday when it trades, BITO will just follow the spot price and dumps as well.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Even BITO would be manipulated.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So manipulation in spot - the SEC must protect, but manipulation in CME futures as a result of spot manipulation is fine? How does it even make sense?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Manipulation&amp;amp;quot; bs is just a big smokescreen to hide what the SEC really wants.. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The real reason is that the SEC wants to control and exert authority over spot exchanges. Thats what DADDY gensler wants, and this is all soft power play from a corrupt regulator acting in his own interest, not in the interest of the people. Spot exchanges unless they are trading securities are not under the purview of the SECURITIES exchange commission. Bitcoin is not a security, and does not fall under SEC&amp;amp;quot;s purview under any stretch of mental gymnastics. Bitcoin futures have already been held as commodities. It literally makes zero sense that CFTC regulates Bitcoin futures, but SEC regulates spot. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yet, the SEC is trying to arm twist both the people and Congress to give regulatory authority over spot exchanges to the SEC. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A regulator must act in the interests of the people, not in the interest of the office. A regulator cant make power play so that the regulator gets more authority from Congress.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Imagine if the last mile electricity supply company cut off power supply to the city because they dont have the authority to fix prices? Everyone would be up in arms.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Recent news about Cardano congestion shooting up around 90% and more, Polygon being borderline unresponsive during Sunflower popularity/incident, and AVAX fees getting sky high while network suffered congestion a few months ago.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If these networks had the Ethereum levels of activitynon them, they wouldnt hold for long. Cardano has a handful of dapps and its already clogged? Same with Polygon. 1 dapp putting whole network on stop is really not what people would expect of the so called &amp;amp;quot;next gen eth competitors.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While I 100% agree that gas fees on Ethereum are absurd, I wonder if the alternatives that we have at the moment in top10 are going to solve that.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Not a great writer&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So yeah this does exist and you can go to jail for trading/holding cryptocurrency. You maybe wondering which country it is. It&amp;amp;#39;s located in South East Asia called Nepal. I&amp;amp;#39;ve been into crypto space for almost a two year now and it&amp;amp;#39;s like living in the future. Recently Three people got arrested and four member of the same family got arrested for trading cryptocurrency. Kudos to those who got arrested. May satoshi be with you. Fuck this country man so tired of this fucking government fuck the system. I&amp;amp;#39;m so frustated and deperessed reading these types of news warning about cryptocurrency. The government doesnot give a fuck about development it&amp;amp;#39;s all corrupted from the root. I want to keep a low profile now but fuck man talk about freedom nothing like this actually exist we are just bind by the shitty rules made by government. kudos to those who live in a country where you can hold and trade cryptos freely and can experience financial freedom. I have huge respect for those country. I want to get out of this shithole country and do what I want freely. So yeah good bye to the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/CC&quot;&amp;gt;r/CC&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; community but I&amp;amp;#39;ll be back when they make crypto Legal or meet a point where I don&amp;amp;#39;t give a fuck and keep trading and holding crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Its unbelievable that they have not revealed this to the users.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One of the projects TIME is collapsing over the past few weeks, and both these users have supposedly been liquidated on leveraged positions yesterday. I dont understand why they were holding such high leverage positions in this crabby market environment. Maybe its just psyops to garner sympathy from users..&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The co-founder of troubled cryptocurrency exchange QuadrigaCX is a convicted felon who served time in the United States for his role in an online identity-theft ring.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Michael Patryn helped launch Quadriga’s trading platform in 2013 alongside Gerald Cotten. The company has come under intense scrutiny since Mr. Cotten, its chief executive, died at the age of 30 from complications of Crohn’s disease while on his honeymoon in India last December, leaving the exchange’s users unable to access $250-million in cash and cryptocurrency.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Update: SIFU&amp;amp;#39;s wallet has over $450m. : &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://debank.com/profile/0x5dd596c901987a2b28c38a9c1dfbf86fffc15d77&quot;&amp;gt;https://debank.com/profile/0x5dd596c901987a2b28c38a9c1dfbf86fffc15d77&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Amount stolen from QuadrigaX? $135m

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This would be the best description at present levels of prices I guess! When you stop caring, it might calm your nerves a bit. Eventually the prices will rise not today, not tomorrow but in longer duration of time they will.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Every month, 50% of Moons burned are meant to be reintroduced in the following distribution, but because of a bug in the contract this has not been happening as expected. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We have deployed an update to the smart contracts to fix the distributions going forward (it won’t apply to this current round but will apply to future rounds after this one). &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For those interested, here are the details from the team for what happened: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://testnet.redditspace.com/address/0x22037C488520DF547c2cd2AA0BE70517082BDA1C/contracts&quot;&amp;gt;buggy Distributions Contract&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; on lines 1705 - 1708, we are adding the Points totalSupply from the previous round to the number of Points claimed in the previous round.  If that total is less than the current Points totalSupply, then that means points were burned (less points exist now than were minted).  However, this code has a bug where it does not account for the Points issued to the SharedOwners.   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is fixed in the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://testnet.redditspace.com/address/0x255b868d0C13C45123085cb574218667433C7E4b/contracts&quot;&amp;gt;updated Distributions Contract&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; lines 1701 &amp;amp;amp; 1747 by keeping track of the Points issued to the SharedOwners in the previous round, and including them in the count of total Points issued for the previous round.  This fix requires 1 distribution round to start working, so burned points will start being reintroduced in the Round 23 distribution.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;***&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This distribution of Moons has been finalized, and Moons are being delivered to users with a registered Vault. Users who do not have a Vault yet will get their Moons when they create one through the Reddit app.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This distribution is based on karma earned from 2021-12-22 to 2022-01-18. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://reddit-meta-production.s3.amazonaws.com/distribution/publish/CryptoCurrency/round_22_finalized.csv&quot;&amp;gt;Here&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; is the finalized list, with contribution scores signed by Reddit.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Moons are &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/CryptoCurrency&quot;&amp;gt;r/CryptoCurrency&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#39;s form of &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://reddit.com/community-points&quot;&amp;gt;Community Points&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, a way for users to be rewarded for their contributions to the subreddit, and they can be used on premium features in the community.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
