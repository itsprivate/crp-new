Do we need to have a computer science background ? Not at all.So i&amp;amp;#39;ve decided to create a step-by-step guide on how to read crypto whitepapers being an average crypto investors.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;First off, you&amp;amp;#39;ll need to know a few basic crypto concepts - if you don&amp;amp;#39;t, learn about them first, which are:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Blockchain&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Consensus mechanism

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Proof of Work&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Proof of Stake&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Nodes&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Mempool&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Soft-fork and hard-fork&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Governance&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Smart contracts&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Byzantine general problem

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault&quot;&amp;gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you know what all of these concepts are, we shall proceed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m going to link in here a few good whitepapers that you guys can check to get an example of how a whitepaper is supposed to be:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf&quot;&amp;gt;https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://solana.com/solana-whitepaper.pdf&quot;&amp;gt;https://solana.com/solana-whitepaper.pdf&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://whitepaper.io/document/581/cardano-whitepaper&quot;&amp;gt;https://whitepaper.io/document/581/cardano-whitepaper&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://whitepaper.io/document/587/terra-whitepaper&quot;&amp;gt;https://whitepaper.io/document/587/terra-whitepaper&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://whitepaper.io/document/582/cosmos-whitepaper&quot;&amp;gt;https://whitepaper.io/document/582/cosmos-whitepaper&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://whitepaper.io/document/1/ripple-whitepaper&quot;&amp;gt;https://whitepaper.io/document/1/ripple-whitepaper&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;*I must say that there are bad projects with good whitepapers. I&amp;amp;#39;m not shilling any of these blockchains. I solely listed their whitepapers because they are well-written and solid.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;*As you may notice. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://whitepaper.io&quot;&amp;gt;whitepaper.io&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; is a good source to research them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now, let me present a small step-by-step guide to analyze whitepapers! I&amp;amp;#39;m also going to be posting screenshots of the bitcoin whitepaper as examples.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;1) Why the project was created ?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Basic starting point. What is the motivation behind the creation ? What problem does it aim to solve ? How different is it from our current solutions ?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/xeuoij5x3zd81.png?width=532&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=67b69cff191f3786122db47291ab87a9706abf49&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/xeuoij5x3zd81.png?width=532&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=67b69cff191f3786122db47291ab87a9706abf49&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;2) What real world utility does it have ?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Nowadays there are a bunch of crypto projects that are a solution looking for a problem. Not everything is supposed to be in the blockchain, guys. Not everything will benefit for being in the blockchain.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/7na6llmy3zd81.png?width=534&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=fadfc64d72a6f84fd8859572b20ccff37bb458e3&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/7na6llmy3zd81.png?width=534&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=fadfc64d72a6f84fd8859572b20ccff37bb458e3&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;3) How does it achieve consensus in the network ?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is a very important point. Its not just about being proof-of-stake, proof-of-work, proof-of-whatever. To achieve consensus means solving the byzantine general problem somehow - it means how the different nodes on a network enter in a consensus if a transaction is true or false without direct communicating with each other. That&amp;amp;#39;s what make it possible to create decentralization.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/oz5ignnz3zd81.png?width=433&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=db477d007345b9c4ee349c6a8eaa9b1dbbc89a66&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/oz5ignnz3zd81.png?width=433&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=db477d007345b9c4ee349c6a8eaa9b1dbbc89a66&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;4) How was the initial coins distributed ?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In bitcoin, obviously there was no pre-mined coins. The first coin ever mined was by Satoshi Nakamoto himself. But on some blockchains, there are initial tokens distributions through pre-mined coins, specially in proof-of-stake ones. It doesn&amp;amp;#39;t make it bad, it&amp;amp;#39;s just different and you should look for it in the whitepaper or other sources. I would consider anything over 10% to devs/venture capitalists a bad project.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/5lo0pes14zd81.png?width=545&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=faf2b28046b9c352d9dab01cce97f41260a64105&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/5lo0pes14zd81.png?width=545&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=faf2b28046b9c352d9dab01cce97f41260a64105&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;5) How does it actually work ?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Many whitepapers are going to have a simplificed mechanism of how the network actually functions, like a summary/graph. If not, you can usually understand it just by reading it. You don&amp;amp;#39;t need to udnerstand everything and all the technicalities, just the main picture - just like it is in the bitcoin whitepaper.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/otq2pyl24zd81.png?width=535&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=bda6e9cb4a880ea6de040839e1fb3b9a3d572a62&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/otq2pyl24zd81.png?width=535&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=bda6e9cb4a880ea6de040839e1fb3b9a3d572a62&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;6) What are the potential weaknesses of the network and how they are adressed ?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Not all whitepapers are going to have this one, but I highly value when its present, since it shows that the devs are actually worried about the network security and not only interested in marketing/profit.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/cwzo8wd34zd81.png?width=541&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=5ea3f4fbe6d42d27302b1e066a18a29fd507c05d&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/cwzo8wd34zd81.png?width=541&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=5ea3f4fbe6d42d27302b1e066a18a29fd507c05d&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;7) Does it have some math stuff you don&amp;amp;#39;t understand ?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Great, now you can ask around at reddit/telegram/etc if this stuff is legit to people that actually understand it! No need to stress over it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/05tdubk44zd81.png?width=451&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=6df05caca93e55cf569d1a34b3e08c93822dacdd&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/05tdubk44zd81.png?width=451&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=6df05caca93e55cf569d1a34b3e08c93822dacdd&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;And that&amp;amp;#39;s it!&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; That&amp;amp;#39;s basically the main things you should be looking for in the whitepaper. Of course, there are going to be &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;much more&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; to read and analyze - this is definitely an oversimplification, only meant to work as a starting point.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I must say that there&amp;amp;#39;s so many more important things that aren&amp;amp;#39;t exactly in the whitepaper most of the time. It&amp;amp;#39;s extremely important to consider, for instance, the tokenomics and the background of the dev team, amongst other things.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;*Sorry for any english mistakes, it&amp;amp;#39;s not my first language.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

This Bill on the surface seeks to make US more competitive against China. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But hidden deep in its 2900 pages, this Bill contains provisions that give the Treasury unlimited powers to prohibit and block crypto exchanges. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Currently, the Treasury cannot take unilateral decisions to block crypto transactions without a formal notice and a public process, and give a 120 day period to challenge any decision. However, under the new Bill, the Treasury can take decisions without any formal process, based solely on its own apprehensions. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The new bill allows the Treasury headed by Yellen to block transmission of funds if the Treasury deems so. It can quickly order blocking any transaction or exchange without any review process or administrative controls. This gives the Treasury unchecked control over all crypto exchanges and transactions. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This language was already included in a bill from last year, however there was opposition and it was removed. However yet again this has been sneaked into a must pass bill. The very idea of sneaking in such clauses in 2900 pages of incomprehensible regulations stinks. How are even the legislators going to read any of this? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The new bill: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://rules.house.gov/sites/democrats.rules.house.gov/files/BILLS-117HR4521RH-RCP117-31.pdf&quot;&amp;gt;https://rules.house.gov/sites/democrats.rules.house.gov/files/BILLS-117HR4521RH-RCP117-31.pdf&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Reading those posts one would think their entire reserves is now in BTC.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But the fact is that just 2% of their reserves are even allocated in BTC. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://bitcointreasuries.net/&quot;&amp;gt;El Salvador holds around $70m worth BTC&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. This is literally nothing for a country. They hold 1691 BTC, in comparison , Microstrategy and Tesla hold over 120,000 BTC  and 40,000 BTC respectively. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FI.RES.TOTL.CD?locations=SV&quot;&amp;gt;El Salvador&amp;amp;#39;s total foreign exchange reserves is pegged at $3.3 BN&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://tradingeconomics.com/el-salvador/foreign-exchange-reserves&quot;&amp;gt;https://tradingeconomics.com/el-salvador/foreign-exchange-reserves&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Less than 2% of their reserves are in BTC.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/bitcoin/bukele-reveals-el-salvadors-gold-reserves-and-benefits-of-bitcoin-over-gold/articleshow/88142021.cms&quot;&amp;gt;El Salvador holds more in GOLD than in BTC&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;According to this article, they hold $79m worth GOLD, but just $70m 
worth BTC. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;People are spreading the false narrative as if he has moved the entire supply of reserves to BTC, which is far away from whats going on.
They have just been making small purchases over time. They literally bought like 2 BTC in the end of Dec. Peanuts for a country.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A 2% allocation in a risky asset class is not a gamble by any means. It is a decent risk reward play for individuals, and countries as well. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you consult with a financial advisor, they may suggest a portfolio allocation of 2% towards emerging asset classes like crypto. Infact, thats what Fidelity suggests as well. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investmentexecutive.com/news/products/fidelity-to-add-bitcoin-exposure-to-portfolio-funds/&quot;&amp;gt;Recently, they added a 2% BTC allocation to their flagship All in one Balanced / Growth funds&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. These are mom and pop funds that are held mostly by conservative investors. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Its been around a year since El Salvador announced their Bitcoin Law and around 6 months since it went active. In this period, they have allocated a small portion of their reserves towards BTC. This is not a gamble, but a solid  and well planned asset allocation strategy. Meanwhile, they have already started mining BTC and over time, this industry has the potential to add to their GDP. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What did people think bitcoin/crypto adoption would be like, one fine day every country across the world will just start accepting BTC out of the blue? Just like that it would become legal tender without any struggle? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These are small steps and it will be risky. Nothing happened overnight, let alone moving from USD to a decentralised currency like Bitcoin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Its shameful that people here want adoption of BTC and crypto, but the first time a large sovereign power has tried to adopt BTC, the same people who want crypto adoption go out of their way to attack them with baseless allegations. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Muhh adoption should be in accordance with my terms, otherwise its not adoption. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These people are just privileged bottom feeders who want to enjoy success without any risks whatsoever.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s disgusting how she basically admits that Corporate money and influence dictate everything. Walmart, Amazon, and other large corporations fund social welfare programs that their workers use in order to deprive them of a living wage and healthcare. Cryptocurrency allows us to break free of this financial bondage and turns the whole system on it&amp;amp;#39;s head.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Truly decentralized cryptocurrency has the potential to revolutionize everything. It can allow for everyone&amp;amp;#39;s vote to matter and have input on the changes society needs. It can allow for efficient and transparent tax allocation so anyone and everyone can audit and keep the system accountable to the people.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Trustless and public block chains are the only way I see to get dark corporate money out of politics.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto isn&amp;amp;#39;t just some novel niche tech, it has the potential to be the catalyst for economic and political revolution. If we can successfully integrate a truly decentralized financial protocol, it changes the dynamics of rich nations to poor nations, rich people to poor people.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I really hope humanity can use cryptocurrency to better society and eliminate the asymmetry&amp;amp;#39;s of power that Corporations, and people like Janet Yellen abuse.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Nayib Bukele chose Bitcoin to try to change the future of his country. Under the current system, El Salvador was condemned to survive by begging for aid from the IMF or the World Bank.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Nayib Bukele understood the why of Bitcoin and decided to seize this opportunity to change the future of El Salvador and its people. The people of El Salvador overwhelmingly support Nayib Bukele in what he is trying to do for the country.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;El Salvador&amp;amp;#39;s bold choice has already changed the way the country is seen around the world. Everyone is talking about El Salvador and more and more entrepreneurs will be coming to El Salvador to participate in this experiment of building the first Bitcoin Nation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Who knew where El Salvador was before Nayib Bukele made this choice? Very few people. No one was talking about El Salvador. Bitcoin is already a game-changer for El Salvador and this is clearly just the beginning.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While the IMF or the World Bank scoffed at Bitcoin a few years ago, now these institutions are getting scared by the growing possibility that the Bitcoin experiment will succeed in El Salvador and motivate other countries to follow Nayib Bukele&amp;amp;#39;s path.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Tonga is talking about adopting Bitcoin by the end of 2022, as are other countries in South and Central America. In short, something is happening and the IMF feels the danger mounting for its obsolete system.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Rather than letting the people determine for themselves, the IMF is threatening El Salvador saying the country must abandon Bitcoin. The IMF&amp;amp;#39;s threats only justify, in my opinion, the very existence of Bitcoin and the absolute necessity for the world to have this alternative system available.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Since El Salvador will logically refuse to obey the IMF, what&amp;amp;#39;s next? Will America eventually orchestrate a coup in El Salvador to overthrow the government and end the Bitcoin experiment? How far are the powerful people in the current system willing to go to prevent countries from expressing their free will in monetary and financial matters?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;El Salvador must continue to resist outside pressure, and other countries that will join the Bitcoin adventure in 2022 must do the same. The world is changing, and the first countries to adopt Bitcoin will be the ones to benefit the most in the future.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

When it comes to value, they probably didn&amp;amp;#39;t understand the ecosystem and use cases of (not shitcoins) crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For someone like me, I did a lot of trading and utilized a lot of different exchanges and wallets (which of course wasn’t a good idea).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I also use a coin tracker and records to keep track of my gains and losses. I started with &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://koinly.io/?r=1&quot;&amp;gt;Koinly&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, but because I didn&amp;amp;#39;t want to pay for the tax reports, I switched to &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://crypto.com/?r=1&quot;&amp;gt;Crypto.com&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and their tax tool. I experienced the same problem with both of them. I then discovered that &amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://cryptotaxcalculator.io/?r=1&quot;&amp;gt;CryptoTaxCalculator&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; was a lot more accurate at recognizing transactions than Koinly.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But seriously though, this just makes government bankers and politicians hypocrites if they make people pay taxes on crypto if they consider it a useless asset and that they&amp;amp;#39;ll receive a part of their paycheck from taxes collected from crypto. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To have intrinsic value, something does not have to be a &amp;amp;quot;physical asset&amp;amp;quot; like gold or have &amp;amp;quot;official&amp;amp;quot; government support or acknowledgment. From a philosophical and practical standpoint, the whole argument that it has no intrinsic worth is a ridiculous slippery slope.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I tried stocks for around 4 years and it never really felt something native to my generation (Gen Z). Overall I believe in crypto more, but I recognize the risks involved with it as I&amp;amp;#39;ve been dabbling in them since 2017.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;ve been looking into stablecoins and generating passive yields with these, but I want to find something which has some form of insurance or low risk of the money suddenly disappearing due to a hack or similar. Basically, I want to be sure that my inheritance money won&amp;amp;#39;t disappear within the next 3-5 years minimum, and ideally, I want to be able to take out a portion of the yield to live off of.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I do own a hardware wallet so I would be ok with storing the funds there. I found a stablecoin called OUSD, which seems to cover my needs together with an added 3rd party insurance, but the protocol does not seem to be that known and has USDT exposure, which is why I am a little bit hesitant as of right now. I&amp;amp;#39;m happy to hear if anyone has positive experience with it though. I am also happy to hear if anyone has other recommendations on what you would do with $200k to create a yield to live off of.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I am based in Europe (in case there are any CEX recommendations that only have US-specific insurances).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: People are telling me to be careful with DMs, funnily enough it did indeed blow up but I&amp;amp;#39;ve been in the game long enough to know not to click anything, thanks everyone!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;$2,000 at 32k&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This isn&amp;amp;#39;t perfect, but it has protected me from volatility a bit and certainly stopped me from dropping all my money on a coin at a higher price.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That made me wonder why it is called &amp;amp;quot;dead cat bounce&amp;amp;quot;. 
Is it a dead bounce from a living cat? 
Is it because the graph looks like a dead cat? 
Is it because a cat just like a chicken can bounce around for a little bit even when dead?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So I Googles it, and now you don&amp;amp;#39;t have to waste 30 seconds of graph staring or reddit scrolling, to do it yourself.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What I found is that it is called a &amp;amp;quot;dead cat bounce&amp;amp;quot; because of the old saying: &amp;amp;quot;even a dead cat will bounce if you drop it from high enough&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Seems pretty grim to me, but that&amp;amp;#39;s why it is called what it&amp;amp;#39;s called.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A good reason to invest in them is because they are considered as blue chips. For those who don&amp;amp;#39;t know, a blue chip corporation is one that is financially stable. In this case, we&amp;amp;#39;re talking about cryptos, and a blue chip coin is one that has a market capital of more than $ 2 billion.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Another reason to invest in them is because of it’s support to projects like Qtum and Envision which brings the best of both coins mentioned in this &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://cryptobullsclub.com/best-innovative-peer-to-peer-exchange-networks/&quot;&amp;gt;article&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. When BTC rises, your entire portfolio climbs with it. Investing in BTC and ETH is equivalent to investing in the entire cryptocurrency market which also means that BTC and ETH also drive the market. Reinforcing the market and increasing the safety of your subsequent bets.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yes, neither BTC nor ETH will offer you fast riches, but they both promise decent returns and allow you to hedge your bets. Everyone has a varied risk tolerance for a variety of reasons; there is no shame in aligning yours with the relative stability of BTC or ETH. You&amp;amp;#39;d still have ETH and BTC working for you even if you lost your insane risky investment.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I can understand why : stupid apes jpegs and the &amp;amp;quot;crypto-bro&amp;amp;quot; subculture is kinda annoying.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But here is what a lot of people need to understand : NFTs are much, much more than jpegs. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s a piece of technology that has the potential to revolutionize a lot of things in our daily digital lives.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Let me illustrate my point. Last week, there was an ETH hackaton organized by ETHglobal. In two days, participants created 255 different projects related to NFTs. Here&amp;amp;#39;s some very interesting projects that have nothing to do with &amp;amp;quot;stupid jpegs&amp;amp;quot; :&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Creativerse, a Minecraft server connected to Ethereum where lands and buildings are turned into NFTs - that means that nobody can censor you. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;0xPhotos, a stock photography marketplace that enable creators to get royalties everytime their photo is used. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;veNFT, a DeFi projects that gives rewards to owners willing to stake their NFT. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;ENS-Signature, which aim to integrate Ethereum Universal Sign-In into official documents such as DocuSigns. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I think I&amp;amp;#39;ve made my point : we are in the very early stages of a groundbreaking technology going mainstream. In ten years, those of us who choose to invest in this sector will be called &amp;amp;quot;lucky&amp;amp;quot; by the very same people that are laughing at NFTs right now.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Keep your mind open. Don&amp;amp;#39;t believe the lies ignorant people are telling you. DYOR, and you will see a lot of opportunities. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;NFTs will be everywhere in our digital lives in less than a decade.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;(I&amp;amp;#39;d like to give credit to Twitter user CroissantETH for opening my eyes about this subject. The projects listed above are from one of his thread.)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cardano has many advantages comparing to other L1 projects:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Academic team who are actively researching new horizons and publishing papers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Novel double layer architecture.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It has Great security.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;4.it is extremely sustainable and environment friendly.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It almost entirely decentralized.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is one of the few top projects with low share of its coins in the hands of whales (if I remember more than 80% was owned by small hodlers).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;transaction are fast and very cheap.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;An increasing number of developers are using its blockchain.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For all it this pros and many more, the only cons I heard about is the recent congestion which almost any crowded blockchain experienced so far. People forgive ETH for practically everything but cardano is bad because of a congestion? Or because it didn&amp;amp;#39;t grow much in market value? 
Or is it another reason which I missed? Like annoying fan base?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I really think ADA doesn&amp;amp;#39;t deserve so much hate. It is a solid project with a really nice team and it might have a bright future ahead of it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m not sure if it&amp;amp;#39;s exchanges, how governments have regulated those exchanges, or something else are that changed things, but this &amp;amp;quot;store of value&amp;amp;quot; thing is not what was intended for Bitcoin.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Maybe it&amp;amp;#39;s a social engineered manipulation by big actors on that sub.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They are missing the big picture:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Why would I ever give up my Bitcoin for printed-to-infinity government coupons (IOU&amp;amp;#39;s)?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Neo: what are you trying to tell me, that I can trade my bitcoins for millions someday?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://gyazo.com/10ead3a5c1fd8ed1e9d150ed6cced62d&quot;&amp;gt;Morpheus: No, Neo. I&amp;amp;#39;m trying to tell you that, when you are ready, you won&amp;amp;#39;t have to&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;When measured in fiat, Bitcoin price will rise infinitely&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Bitcoin has no top, because fiat has no bottom&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You earn in value appreciation/equity against USD as well as in the expensive rents your tenants are paying. If you need even more fiat you borrow against it, and pass the prime real estate to your children and grand children... for many generations, and they don&amp;amp;#39;t ever sell it for fiat either.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Major investors like VC and private equity funds, put their money into projects with a roughly five year time horizon (when they have to pay back their investors.)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Literally billions of dollars have flowed into the crypto markets in January, 2022 alone. Temporary price movements have little to no effect on these investor decisions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As the old sports saying goes, hockey players skate to where the puck will be, not where it is now.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Other trends point in the same direction.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;More and more banks are going to offer crypto trading services (watch out for those fees) according to industry stalwart American Banker (&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.americanbanker.com/list/7-tech-trends-to-watch-in-2022-from-crypto-banking-to-biometrics&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.americanbanker.com/list/7-tech-trends-to-watch-in-2022-from-crypto-banking-to-biometrics&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;). &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They do this because they project continued demand for these services, which requires them to spend money on infrastructure, marketing, It teams, to make it happen. As slow as banks generally move, the fact they are offering these services is a longer-term plus.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Still not enough positive momentum?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Consider which Blockchain/web 3.0/tokenization projects are actually making services better, faster, or cheaper (or will relatively soon.) The tech adoption curve starts out slow, but eventually sweeps upwards over time (no one knows how long it will take until there&amp;amp;#39;s mass adoption.)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crashes like this shake out weak projects, get-rich-quick traders (they&amp;amp;#39;ll be back when green days return, no doubt), and other fad chasers. That doesn&amp;amp;#39;t change the longer-term trajectory of the industry.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

If you&amp;amp;#39;re freaking out because you YOLO&amp;amp;#39;d your savings into Dogelonmars42069, then yeah, you might have to learn a few hard lessons.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For the rest of you who have done their best to invest in more time proven projects like BTC/ETH its time to buckle up relax and wait for this all to blow over. Freaking out and panic selling to save a fraction of your investment wont help your future self. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Nobody knows anything. This might be a blip or a bear market. The best way to last in this space is to take a breather, zoom out, and realize eventually everything is gonna be alright. Success does not happen overnight.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;If you&amp;amp;#39;re freaking out now because you made some bad investments or over-extended yourself use this time as a learning opportunity.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I am not a crypto wizard. I made every mistake a newbie could make. Back in 2017-18 you could buy crypto with credit cards lol. But what I hope I&amp;amp;#39;m conveying is that if you hold onto your coins you&amp;amp;#39;ll most likely come out ahead eventually. In 2018 was so depressed and mad at myself I just uninstalled my apps and didnt look at my crypto until 2020. But then it got better and most of the projects I invested in back then started doing well again. If I had sold and not weathered the dip I would&amp;amp;#39;ve been even more angry at myself.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Remember to take time for yourself. Stop staring at reddit and charts all day. Please talk to someone if you&amp;amp;#39;re thinking about self-harm. It gets better yall. =)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
