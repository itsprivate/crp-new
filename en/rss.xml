&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;From this article, I would argue that $45,000 transaction fees out of about  $1.98 million in volume in the first day of launching the NFT market place is reason to believe that the NFT space has potentially entered normalization.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The NFTs Gamestop sells do not appear to be geared towards speculation like we&amp;amp;#39;ve seen at the top of the NFT hype and they are currently being bought by people who want them as part of a gaming or collectible experience.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For GIF/art type NFTs, I would argue this is what that market should look like, meaning, some type of &amp;amp;quot;affordable&amp;amp;quot; price for a respective NFT for people who want them to enhance an experience, not to speculate on future price.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On top of that, this is occurring at arguably the lowest point in the NFT hype phase and the future seems bright after all.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thoughts or counter arguments to what we&amp;amp;#39;re seeing?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;EDIT:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;/u/Psukhe&quot;&amp;gt;u/Psukhe&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; Made a great comparison with this comment:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;OpenSea did $1.1M in volume in the last 24 hours, and 2.5% of that as  fees, which is 27.5k, over the last week OpenSea had 87M in volume, or  218k in fees. So it seems decent if they can keep the volume up? &amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Because we assume that a nation with a small (and often weak) economic area will face inflation consequences more rapidly than those called &amp;amp;quot;developed nations&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Well, me as a European I always thought that like most of you. Now I&amp;amp;#39;m finding that the money I earned during the last year-period is worth 20% less. Imagine my joy.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/dazmnfjxx3b91.png?width=1366&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=481196262d8b9e2fc4c7f52791d6acbd913fb804&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/dazmnfjxx3b91.png?width=1366&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=481196262d8b9e2fc4c7f52791d6acbd913fb804&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And this doesn&amp;amp;#39;t even take in consideration inflation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We get sad when out stock/crypto plummets -20%... Why don&amp;amp;#39;t we have the same reaction with FIAT? It&amp;amp;#39;s literally the same thing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m personally not invested more than 20% of my entire wealth into crypto, because (let&amp;amp;#39;s be honest), it&amp;amp;#39;s a high-risk asset, or so I thought.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now I&amp;amp;#39;m everyday more convinced that the difference between crypto and FIAT is very subtle.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In fact, starting last month I decided to drastically increase my DCA amount, but always remaining to a comfortable level. I still want to sleep well at night.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This post may seem like a rant towards the financial system (maybe it is who cares), but I&amp;amp;#39;m sure you understand that behind the frustration lies a very hard truth:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Traditional Financial System cannot hold like this forever. It need to change. Soon.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The malicious contract pollutes the event data so that block explorers index the &amp;amp;quot;From&amp;amp;quot; as the legitimate &amp;amp;quot;Uniswap V3: Positions NFT&amp;amp;quot; contract.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now that a user sees that &amp;amp;quot;Uniswap V3: Positions NFT&amp;amp;quot; sent them a token (without knowledge of the event pollution attack), they would get curious and check the token.  The token name directs them to a website that looks similar to Uniswap, and once users connected their wallets, their cryptocurrency was drained from their wallets.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So far, they have scammed (~$9.1million) from users, from native tokens (ETH), ERC20 tokens, and NFTs (namely, Uniswap LP positions) &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The stolen ETH is being laundered through Tornado Cash.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/h20mdrzix1b91.png?width=939&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=1d0c30954f51f111ef2065cc28ac87579fd740e5&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/h20mdrzix1b91.png?width=939&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=1d0c30954f51f111ef2065cc28ac87579fd740e5&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The attack might be big, as [&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/0xSisyphus&quot;&amp;gt;0xSisyphus&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;] pointed out that a large LP (0xecc6b71b294cd4e1baf87e95fb1086b835bb4eba) also seems to get phished.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;How to Protect Yourself:&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you have received the Malicious Token. Do not try to burn it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Because to burn it, you would have to interact with it. And, It&amp;amp;#39;s heavily advised to not interact with suspicious tokens because:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You don&amp;amp;#39;t want to waste gas-burning tokens  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You don&amp;amp;#39;t want to open yourself to an attack, such as ETH_RUNE  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In summary, just leave it and pretend you don&amp;amp;#39;t see it&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the last weeks they successfully completly eliminated their liquidation risk (now at $2.7k) and paid down hundred of millions in debt. Even in the least 24h they paid down 113M on debt to AAVE any Compound, now their only remaining debt is 123M. And they can very likely pay that off too. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Happy to see that at least somewhere investors and not getting rigged. Hopefully they can actually lift their suspension that have been here for nearly month now and get back to normal.

In bull market most people protect their profits, but during bear market a lot of people like to share their losses. Problem is when bull market will come back you will have target on your back.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you need share loses or gains use %,  just tell my portfolio is 70% down or 30% up, not how much  it is  worth. People can do math. Also not tell how much you made, just tell your coin did x10, let people guess if you invested $10 or $20k.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Never share any financial details of your portfolio outside reddit too. You think messenger, SMS, e-mails or some other social media are safe? Do not even write notes on phone&amp;amp;#39;s notebook with exact details. If anyone will hack your phone they will have access to all those things.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The same rule applies in real life. A lot of people like to  brag about their crypto profits, later they are often find dead with hole in the head... And I am not even joking, there were many articles about those situations, especially in bad neighbourhoods, everyone who is here long enough remember them. Even if you won&amp;amp;#39;t be  dead, your family &amp;amp;amp; friends and strangers may ask you for money, become jealous or angry. Someone you know or person that overhead may also broke into your home and then nothing will help if they will find your seed phrases or stole your device with access to wallets.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Never tell % if people can check even single of your coins to guesss value. It is especially  important in case of moons. If you tell how much % of your portfolio moons are...suprise... suprise everyone can calculate value of your whole portfolio. Simmilar situation if anyone know your wallet adress.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you blur $ value of coins on photo you share most often it is still possible to restore it by playing with contrast. You either need to cut part of photo entirely or not share it at all. Some exchanges give you also option to hide $balance which may also help if you really need it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I am in crypto long enough, I saw people that shared details of huge portfolios, I also saw countless cases of people losing huge porftolios for whatever reasons. Maybe some of them wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t lose their crypto if they would be quiet. Don&amp;amp;#39;t be like them, even if risk is minimal or your portfolio is small do not worth to took unnecessary risk by  sharing any financial details.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Although the issue with LUNA have been stated over and over again, it still affects families and individuals today.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As a korean living in korea, I get to see news reports of people who are affected by LUNA crash.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And recently there was a whole family in korea who committed suicide. The father had apparently invested his life savings on LUNA, and went bankrupt. He went on a fake vacation, deceiving his child and drugged her. Then there were reports of them missing, and the police department scouted the family, trying to track them down with CCTVs. In the end, they found their car in the bottom of the ocean, it was presumed that they committed suicide by purposefully driving their car into the ocean.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
Article about this will be posted in the comment section  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There should be something done to Do Kwon and prevent rugpulls like this to happen. As of right now,  Do Kwon and LUNA employees are forbidden to leave the country.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
So everyone, as a member of one of the biggest crypto community, help people out by posting warnings about scam projects.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

But is it really?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Here I tested the price difference, the real price that you would buy at and not theoretical price, between: Coinbase Pro, Crypto_com, robinhood and US Binance.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My approach was simple&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;I put in exactly 1 ETH or 0.1 BTC in the buy, and only recorded when the price is locked and at the final stage. This is to ensure that the price is as accurate as possible. For example, Binance and CDC literally has a count down timer.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;to ensure that its not bias, I did everything on a phone and I tried to do them in random orders.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;I took multiple measures throughout the day  on this weekend so to minimize volatility as I move from one app to another. I estimate from the first to last app its about 1 min.  This is from July 9-10, 2022 PST time.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Binance US has free BTC trade fee but ETH is .5% fee - this was also accounted for.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Coinbase Pro was very clear on the fees and shows the exact amount including fees.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;for BTC I also include coinmarket price.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The results were very surprising.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitcoin:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Results.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Really surprising is that robinhood had consistently the lowest price.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Not so surprisingly is that  CDC had the most expensive price, as much as 1.8% in some cases&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;CoinMarket Cap always underestimates the real purchasing price, in red BTC plot.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Because Robinhood had the lowest price all others were compared to it.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Price difference compared to robinhood&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Again, all fees were accounted for .5% for binance US and .6% for coinbase.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;conclusion and TLDR.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Robinhood has the lowest purchasing price. While CDC had the highest, as much as 1.8% for ETH. Coinbase is very similar to robinhood despite all the fees. and because of the sentiment here, coinbase do look to be the best balance.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Moroever transfer fees is important to think about and again suprisingly RH had very low similar BTC withdrawal fees, and CDC is extremely over priced for transfer fee.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You could always set limit price but for people who DCA and auto trade with that this could potentially be useful.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;edit: RH is like poison here but I wanted to be as objective as possible and that is what the data says.  On the other hand Coinbase is very similar and withdrawal fees are very low compared to CDC and binance.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

They don&amp;amp;#39;t spend time on reddit. They don&amp;amp;#39;t follow any influencers. They don&amp;amp;#39;t use Twitter, YT etc.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We always talk about how we shouldn&amp;amp;#39;t be introducing family or friends inco crypto. And I always avoided it, the only person I&amp;amp;#39;ve talked to about is my wife for obvious reasons. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;ve never mentioned investing her own money. But my wife was very adamant to buy some crypto for her and she basically told me: &amp;amp;quot;tell me when it doubled&amp;amp;quot; uhm... OK honey. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So that&amp;amp;#39;s what I did. She gave me cash, I bought some crypto for her and let it sit, she never talked about it again, she never asked, she never mentioned any news etc. and it was in the middle of the bull run. Anyway, it increased by 100% in few months and I told her about it. And she was like &amp;amp;quot;great now sell it, sell it all&amp;amp;quot; and I&amp;amp;#39;m like whelp, OK. She took the money and we never spoke about it again, it was incredible. She had a plan to double the money and then cash out. She forgot about it for a long time. And because she only invested what she could afford to lose she was never woried. To her that money was basically burned and forgotten. She didn&amp;amp;#39;t want 5x or 10x or 100x it, she simply doubled it and that&amp;amp;#39;s it. She had a clear target. I think one of the reasons why she was so calm about it was simply because she never followed any news. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I think a lot of people here would benefit with similar approach to investing. As long as they invest only what they can really afford to lose in case if things go south.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I’m quite disappointed but from a business perspective I understand not wanting to go under by simply trying to sustain their rewards program as this is probably one of their largest expenses.

While it is good advice, it is very possible that we experience a recession in the near future and having an emergency fund is really important right now. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For those who don&amp;amp;#39;t know what an emergency fund is, it&amp;amp;#39;s essentially a sum of money (yes, FIAT) that you set aside for large unexpected expenses such as job loss, unforeseen medical expenses, etc. I know current prices are tempting to just buy crypto but if and when we go into a recession, it&amp;amp;#39;s better to be safe than sorry.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The amount that you should put into an emergency fund is different for everyone and depends on what kind of support you would have if something happened. I generally stick to having enough stashed away to support myself for at least 3 months but depending on your situation, you may want more.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I know it&amp;amp;#39;s hard enough to set aside any money with prices being so high right now but having an emergency fund is more important than buying the dip.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

First, I took a list of all coins from CoinGecko API, and I filtered them to exclude leveraged tokens like &amp;amp;quot;SPDR S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 ETF tokenized stock FTX&amp;amp;quot; and of course shitcoins.
This step eliminated 7302 out of 13403 coins, leaving 6101 for the next step.
In the next step I filtered the remaining coins based on a few conditions I came up with:
- They must have an ATH Market Cap lower than 200k BTC (~$10B at good times), It&amp;amp;#39;s less likely to 20x if it already did before. Also there&amp;amp;#39;s usually a reason why it&amp;amp;#39;s not in the top anymore.
- The current market cap must be above 4000 BTC ($80M) - most of those below are scams.
- The current market cap must be also below 50000 BTC ($1B), the higher the market cap the less volatile the coin is, reducing the chance for a 20x.
- The supply has to be between 1 million and 1 trillion, no serious project goes beyond this limits.
- Lastly, it can&amp;amp;#39;t be more than 90% down from its ATH in BTC, if you look into the coins of 2021 bull market, you&amp;amp;#39;ll see that none of them have a history like this.
I used BTC for all comparisons because it makes all the bull markets more equal to each other.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After these steps we are left with 74 coins out of 6101. I filtered them out by hand to pick the best 6 I don&amp;amp;#39;t own yet, so my opinion is objective. Here are the coins that survived:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Arweave (AR)
Arweave is a file storage system like Filecoin, except you pay once to store the data forever, so you don&amp;amp;#39;t need to worry about running out of money and losing your data.
In Blockweave (Arweave&amp;amp;#39;s variation of Blockchain) every block has to reference a randomly chosen historical block, incentivising miners to store more data.
Currently there is 70 TB of data stored on Arveawe. For example if you store 10% of all data, you have 10% chance to be able to mine a block. This mechanism also reduces the power of ASICs in mining.
Arweave was launched in June 2018, and its market cap hit 46k BTC ($2.88B at max) 4 times in 2021 and currently has a Market cap of 19k BTC ($390M).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Stacks (STX)
Stacks is an L1 blockchain, but it serves as a Smart Contract layer for Bitcoin. It uses a consensus mechanism called Proof of Transfer AKA Proof of Burn, it consists of 2 parties - Miners and Stackers.
Bitcoin miners can deposit their BTC rewards on Stacks to receive STX and write a Stacks block. Stackers on the other hand lock STX to receive the BTC from deposited by the miners.
Unfortunately Stacks&amp;amp;#39; smart contracts are incompatible with EVM, maybe they want to be more distinct from Ethereum and alts in general. Other chains like this have been successful anyway though.
A downside of this model is the block time which just like in Bitcoin is 10 minutes, but in return receives Bitcoin level security and has super low transaction fees as low as $0.00007.
Stacks was launched in January 2019, had its highest market cap of 70k BTC or $3.74B in December 2021 and currently sits at 25k BTC ($520M).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Mina Protocol (MINA)
Mina Protocol is a lightweight blockchain designed to have a constant size of 22 KB using zkSNARKs (without trusted setup). With these 22 KB you can fully participate in the network including consensus.
One worrying thing about MINA is its inflation, in the last year alone the coin&amp;amp;#39;s supply has tripled. Every coin has an inflation phase although MINA has one that&amp;amp;#39;s very long.
The annual inflation will decrease to around 20% in late 2023 which will make it way safer.
Mina was launched in May 2021, and its market cap had an ATH of 35k BTC ($1.55B) in April 2022. Its current market cap is 19k BTC ($390M).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;1inch (1INCH)
1inch takes prices from lots of different DEXs and compares its prices to get the best rate. This costs you a bit more in fees, but it&amp;amp;#39;s worth it.
Another feature of 1inch is its Mobile Wallet, which makes trading on a phone way more user friendly. It supports 8 different EVM compatible chains and they recently added support for different dapps.
The token is not an important part of the dapp, but considering Uniswap and PancakeSwap have their tokens in the Top 50, it might join Top 50 as well..
1inch launched in December 2020. Its market cap peaked at 24k BTC ($1.2B) in December 2021, and the current market cap is 17k BTC or $350M&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Secret Network (SCRT)
Secret Network is a smart contract platform that features fully private smart contracts. It&amp;amp;#39;s built on the Cosmos SDK and supports the IBC cross chain bridge.
A downside of SCRT is that it uses Trusted Execution Enviroments (TEE) which are parts of CPU that are most likely going to be cracked someday, but it&amp;amp;#39;s still good for short-term privacy.
SCRT also has a few non-IBC decentralized bridges for Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain and Monero. The existence of a Monero token decreases the usage of SCRT token, altough it&amp;amp;#39;s also good.
Secret Network launched in September 2020. In its peak in January 2022 its market cap was 34k BTC ($1.45B). Now its market cap is only 7.7k BTC ($160M)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Nervos Network (CKB)
Nervos Network connects all families of smart contracts platform like EVM and IBC. It allows developers to make Universal dApps for different blockchains using the same code.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

Please read and consider before commenting or downvoting.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is a response to &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/vrcb1h/i_calculated_how_much_a_coin_would_be_worth_from/&quot;&amp;gt;this post&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; that got a lot of attention recently.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I get it. Alt-coins are enticing. But the above post is very dangerous. People who read the above post seem to erroneously assume that all of those alt coins will eventually come back to its ATH. Because crypto always comes back, right? This leads readers to conclude that they should put money in the alt-coin that has fallen the most percentage-wise for the highest gains when the ATH comes back. This is NOT analysis. This is a fun, fantastical thought experiment. None of this logic is based in reality, I&amp;amp;#39;ll do my best to explain.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Let me start with this statement that should be the whole takeaway of this post: *&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;NO MAINSTREAM ALT-COIN HAS EVER ACHIEVED ATH AGAINST BITCOIN IN TWO CONSECUTIVE CYCLES.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; (*The only exception I know of is Dogecoin, and only because Elon pumped it. Hardly a sustainable model or basis for investment. So it&amp;amp;#39;ll be ignored for this post.)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What this means is, every dollar you invest in crypto will be better going to Bitcoin than any other coin. I know a lot of people love their alt-coin projects that they are passionate about. I love crypto and want to see it succeed. But please look at the price history of alt-coins. They all fail against bitcoin in the long run. I&amp;amp;#39;m not trying to crap on any alt-coin project you are passionate about, it very well &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;may&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; succeed and be the next bitcoin. All I&amp;amp;#39;m saying is let&amp;amp;#39;s look at how well this bet has performed in the past.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Pretty much every alt-coin price history looks something like this:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/2p967fpnija91.png?width=1890&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=02d96d6103f84cf9cae4abfb4670e91b8156fea1&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/2p967fpnija91.png?width=1890&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=02d96d6103f84cf9cae4abfb4670e91b8156fea1&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here&amp;amp;#39;s FTM. A decent project that was promoted by many. Such is the alt-coin life cycle. There&amp;amp;#39;s a price discovery in a bull run, temporary euphoria (this is where most of us buy in, near the ATH), and then death. Doesn&amp;amp;#39;t recover from that. Go look for yourself! Look up any alt-coin price history and it&amp;amp;#39;ll look pretty much like this. It would have been better to put that money in Bitcoin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But what if we just weather the bear market? Just like the above post in question, what if we buy more when it&amp;amp;#39;s low and get XXX% return when it hits the ATH again! It&amp;amp;#39;s a bigger return than even Bitcoin returning to its ATH! People I know did this same &amp;amp;quot;what if it went back to ATH?&amp;amp;quot; experiment back in 2019. We all put a decent amount of money into NANO, because we would 30x our money! Well, look what happened:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/7qcwew1pija91.png?width=1888&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=002daf610a4a3bfdb4112f4398111fdb7e795c8c&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/7qcwew1pija91.png?width=1888&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=002daf610a4a3bfdb4112f4398111fdb7e795c8c&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Didn&amp;amp;#39;t get close to its ATH. It would have been better to put that money in Bitcoin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But what about coins where it DOES hit another ATH? Some coins will do that, here&amp;amp;#39;s ADA for example:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/e4k2odbqija91.png?width=1894&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=65ae3ba3c25bc1e76588c45f2a1cb4f533b45142&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/e4k2odbqija91.png?width=1894&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=65ae3ba3c25bc1e76588c45f2a1cb4f533b45142&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It shattered it&amp;amp;#39;s ATH! What a great one to hold! Actually, no. Look at it&amp;amp;#39;s price against Bitcoin:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/5by4lhuqija91.png?width=1880&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=dbebc656e9d64c18272326826a40649c294fc6db&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/5by4lhuqija91.png?width=1880&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=dbebc656e9d64c18272326826a40649c294fc6db&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Even ADA, the &amp;amp;quot;ETH-Killer&amp;amp;quot; didn&amp;amp;#39;t reach another ATH against bitcoin. It would have been better to put that money in Bitcoin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And here&amp;amp;#39;s ETH:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/mb7hfvq8yja91.png?width=1874&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e62eb3387c24a0b8ce83bff3bccce66ea46314d1&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/mb7hfvq8yja91.png?width=1874&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e62eb3387c24a0b8ce83bff3bccce66ea46314d1&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yes, ETH, like some alt-coins, retouched it&amp;amp;#39;s USD ATH. But not against Bitcoin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For any dollar you put into a crypto that&amp;amp;#39;s NOT bitcoin, you are making one of the worst bets in history. Far worse than casino odds. You are literally betting for something to happen that has pretty much never happened before. Yet people still put money in alt-coins! Even the &amp;amp;quot;smart money&amp;amp;quot; does. A 2019 study by Deloitte found that a simple buy and hold strategy of bitcoin outperformed every single crypto hedge fund. Embarrassing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Another AWFUL bet is anything in the top 10! Every coin that entered the top 10 has lost value against BTC from then on. And when one leaves the top 10, it has never returned. (Again, except DOGE). If you own a coin in the top 10, or worse, continue owning it after it leaves the top 10, you are making one of the worst bets in history! It doesn&amp;amp;#39;t matter how passionate you are about the community, or how much you just know/believe that the coin will be the next big thing. History shows you are most definitely wrong in this bet. Should put the money in Bitcoin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One case for alt-coins that lots of people make is the bitcoin dominance chart. Guy from Coin bureau likes to point this one out a lot. According to him, it has been &amp;amp;quot;dropping like a rock&amp;amp;quot; since 2017:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/rw8wnptrija91.png?width=2714&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e68b17a33b1b1a6c8341aac05cd7f3a2ee025d51&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/rw8wnptrija91.png?width=2714&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e68b17a33b1b1a6c8341aac05cd7f3a2ee025d51&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So the future is alt-coins right? Bitcoin is clearly losing market share to alts, right? Actually, this metric tells the opposite. Consider the sheer number of coins now in existence, along with the insane growth of stablecoins. If all components of this metric remained constant over the past several years, then I would agree that the future seems to be alt-coins. However, in 2017 there were less than 1000 cryptocurrencies. Now there are over 20,000! And value in stablecoins has exploded. So now, there are 20x more alt-coins and over 100 billions dollars of stablecoins in the denominator of this metric competing for marketshare against bitcoin. To have all that be added to the denominator and BTC dominance still be so high is remarkable, and only proves that it will continue to be the most valuable chain for the foreseeable future. History shows any bet against bitcoin has been a bad one.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Lastly, if you simply MUST invest in an alt-coin for whatever reason, here&amp;amp;#39;s my advice on how to do it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Ignore any alt-coins that have already made the upside-down V pattern in the first visual. If that&amp;amp;#39;s already happened anywhere in its price history, then ignore it.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Find a new alt-coin that has a sideways price pattern and was created during the current crypto winter.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Its value proposition must be something that hasn&amp;amp;#39;t had a bubble yet. No BTC forks/clones. No NFTs or platform tokens. No DeFi or DEX coins. Something new, like maybe soul-bound tokens for this next rally? (Not a soul-bound token itself, because that can&amp;amp;#39;t be sold, but a token for its infrastructure)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Sell it somewhere in the next bull run. Don&amp;amp;#39;t get too greedy, take the profits and put them in Bitcoin.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I do not consider myself to be a Bitcoin Maxi. Too many people lose money in alt-coin projects. Too many newbies buy an alt-coin as their first coin. Yes, there is money to be made in alt-coins, but mostly by getting in and out at the right time, not through a buy and hold which is 1000x easier. Yes, there&amp;amp;#39;s money to be made in some alts, but by and large it&amp;amp;#39;s better for the money to be put in Bitcoin. If someone has more info to prove me wrong or teach me something, please do. But unless you can, please learn from the price history of alt-coins. Buy bitcoin, put it in cold storage, and wait. History *so far* has shown that to be the best thing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;tl;dr Price history of alt-coins against Bitcoin proves that holding alt-coins are always a bad investment.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
