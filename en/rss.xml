&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;She is a strong believer in disruptive technologies.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Think robotics, tomorrow‚Äôs batteries and genomics as well as erm.. blockchain technology and is perhaps &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;the most bullish person&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; on crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;She recently predicted that BTC will be worth &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;over $1M by 2030&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, making her perhaps the most bullish person I know.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Allow me to summarize the report‚Äôs highlights on the future of Bitcoin..&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Ark Invest analysts predict that the market capitalization of blockchain technology will reach $49T in 2030.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That‚Äôs roughly &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;half&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; what the global equities market is worth today ($106T).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cathie Wood predicts that &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;more than half (57%)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; of that market cap will come from Bitcoin alone; believing Bitcoin‚Äôs market cap will climb to &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$28T by 2030.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Currently, Bitcoin&amp;amp;#39;s market cap stands at $815B, down from an ATH of around $1.2T.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And this is where she gets her $1M/BTC price point from (more details on that at the end of this post).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;According to Cathie Wood, El Salvador‚Äôs Bitcoin ‚Äúexperiment‚Äù is already a resounding success.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Why?&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; The data &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;speaks volumes.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;# of people in El Salvador with a Bitcoin wallet = &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;3.8 million&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;# of people in El Salvador with a traditional bank account = &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;1.9 million&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The % of eligible citizens with a Bitcoin wallet in El Salvador is 84% as of December 2021, versus 42% with a traditional bank account.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;What‚Äôs more bullish is people are actually using these wallets!&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Bitcoin wallets in El Salvador settled (on average) &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$2M worth of transactions in remittances DAILY&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; as of October 2021.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;On an annual basis, this accounts for roughly &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;12% of ALL remittances sent&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; to El Salvador (total = $6B annually, or &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;2% of El Salvador‚Äôs overall GDP&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Reader‚Äôs Note I ‚Äî Remittances are money transfers sent from one party who works abroad to another in their home country (typically family).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;And El Salvador is not alone..&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;2021 was the year that Bitcoin‚Äôs annual settlement volume &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;surpassed that of Visa‚Äôs.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitcoin‚Äôs total came to a whopping &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$13.1T, or ~120% of Visa‚Äôs.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is effectively a &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;5x increase&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; on the previous year ($2.3T in 2020, ~24% of the Visa network‚Äôs).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However, is the Bitcoin network becoming more dominated by larger investors with deeper pockets?!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&quot;md-spoiler-text&quot;&amp;gt;Well.. probably.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The average value of each individual transaction in 2021 was $136,555. This is up from $21,590 in 2020, significantly more than the increase in Bitcoin‚Äôs price over the same period.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This makes sense as ETFs, countries and companies have all increased their BTC holdings in 2021 and now hold roughly 1.5 million BTC. Or, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;8% of the total circulating supply.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The 5 largest publicly disclosed bitcoin wallets belong to the (1) Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (2) Block One (3) Microstrategy (4) CoinShares and (5) Tesla.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;But what about me, you and the annoying Karen you avoid on the school run?&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Believe it or not, most Bitcoin investors in 2021 were not speculators.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The number of BTC long term holders has been steadily increasing since 2011, except for a substantial ‚Äúblip‚Äù back in 2018. Understandable.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This trend has continued throughout the most recent bull run in 2020/21.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Long term investors now collectively hold &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;13.5m Bitcoin&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, or more than half of all BTC.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Reader‚Äôs Note II ‚Äî A ‚Äúlong term investor‚Äù is defined by Ark Invest as someone who has held their BTC for more than 155 days.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Reader‚Äôs Note III ‚Äî Yes, they removed any wallets with ‚Äúdust‚Äù BTC from the data.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;So how does Cathie Wood arrive at the $28T BTC market cap by 2030?&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Is she, like all of us, drunk on hopium?&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I‚Äôll give you the figures and let you make your mind up:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Reader‚Äôs Note IV ‚Äî Important For Context..  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Gold‚Äôs market capitalization is $10T (2021)  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The global equities market has an overall market capitalization of $106T (2021)  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In their analysis, Ark Invest chose to project BTC‚Äôs 2030 market cap using 2021 data rather than ‚Äú&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;projected&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;‚Äù 2030 data/guesswork.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now For The Juice:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;BTC will become the new ‚Äúdigital gold‚Äù and account for a whopping 50% of gold‚Äôs market cap by 2030 ‚Äî or, $5.5T.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;More S&amp;amp;amp;P companies will keep BTC on their balance sheets (like Tesla). Ark Invest estimates 5% of balance sheets will be kept in BTC ‚Äî adding another $4.2T.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Institutions are not far behind and will keep 2.55% of assets in BTC ‚Äî accounting for $4.1T.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;High Net Worth Individuals will dedicate 5% of their portfolios to BTC ‚Äî that‚Äôs another $4.0T right there.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Nation-states will keep 1% of their reserves in BTC ‚Äî providing a further $3.8T in ‚Äúvalue‚Äù to the market.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;US Banks will get in on the action too and use BTC for 25% of all inter-bank settlements ‚Äî that‚Äôs another $3.8T.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;BTC will have replaced fiat currencies in emerging markets at a rate of around 10% by 2030 ‚Äî or, $2.8T.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Finally, BTC will account for 50% of all global remittances ‚Äî adding a relatively meagre $0.3T.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&quot;md-spoiler-text&quot;&amp;gt;Grand Total = $28.5T (equal to $1.36M/BTC)&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Reader‚Äôs Note V ‚Äî For those interested, I personally think some of these numbers are actually conservative especially as (mentioned earlier) they‚Äôre based on 2021 market capitalization rather than ‚Äúprojected‚Äù 2030 market caps.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Obv there is so much more in the report about blockchain tech and DeFi, but I chose to focus on BTC in this post because I, honestly, already doubt anyone will read this considering its length so it doesn‚Äôt need to be any longer.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyway, I‚Äôm sorry if I bored you and you‚Äôre most welcome if you happened to read and appreciate this post :)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

For &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://crypto.com&quot;&amp;gt;crypto.com&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; most likely Matt Damon is going to appear again.  But did you know that in the last commercial there was a hidden Easter egg, hidden to the side, below is the image&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/j9tdy8pybog81.png?width=686&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=f528560f443709228ff4478efd79ef796e8f732d&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/j9tdy8pybog81.png?width=686&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=f528560f443709228ff4478efd79ef796e8f732d&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;you see that QR code hidden to the side? Well had you scan that code; it would had taken you to a website which you can register and then get a free airdrop.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyways, this super bow, the entire US is going to be watching and I think speculate that buried in those commercials might be some other hidden easter eggs, may be not QR codes but something else.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I don&amp;amp;#39;t think its going to be much even if there are easter eggs but hey free money and the chance to brag that you found it on your own.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Two camps have formed, and there is no indication that they will find common ground anytime soon. I will not take side with this post, as I only want to inform people of this issue.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;So... What exactly is going on?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One of the pillars of the Web3 movement is the Ethereum Naming Service (ENS). This is a way to associate a public address with an easy-to-remember address; rather than telling your friend to send ether to you at 0x1234abcd..., for example, you tell them to send that to &amp;amp;quot;yourname.eth&amp;amp;quot;. It may not matter much today, but this protocol is a part of the foundation on which much of Web3 is built.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One of ENS&amp;amp;#39;s most influential developers, Brantly Millegan, has made some very controversial tweets about homosexuality, trans people, masturbation and pornography. Brantly is a practicing Catholic, and he has stated that all of these things are &amp;amp;quot;evil&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;People in the community asked him to withdraw his words and apologize, which he refused.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Why did the situation escalate?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Soon, two camps were formed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On the one hand, those who believe that Brantly can say whatever he wants, since it is his freedom of speech. These people do not necessarily endorse his positions, but they defend his right to express them. They argue that the essence of Web3 is permissionless. In their view, nobody should be cancelled for their personnal beliefs.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On the other hand, there are those who believe that Brantly views are dangerous and hurtful to members of the community who are gay, transgender, or who use pornography. They are afraid that, as a public figure in the Web3 community, Brantly will scare away a lot of people with his opinions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We have all the ingredients for a good old-fashioned &amp;amp;quot;wokeness versus free speech&amp;amp;quot; conflict.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;What are the consequences of the dispute?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Brantly was removed from his position by the organization that manages ENS. Some of the &amp;amp;quot;free speech&amp;amp;quot; fringe reacted by selling their ENS tokens, and some even gave up their .eth domain entirely.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On its side, the &amp;amp;quot;woke&amp;amp;quot; fringe hopes that such incidents will not happen again. They are gathered under the name &amp;amp;quot;ENS is for everyone&amp;amp;quot;, and they militate for Web3 to be a safe space for everyone.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;What&amp;amp;#39;s next?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I don&amp;amp;#39;t know, and nobody knows. But this first culture war is a great test to determine the values of Web3. Do we want it to be a bastion of free speech, or do we want it to be a welcoming place for everyone? The next few weeks are gonna be interesting, that&amp;amp;#39;s for sure.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thanks for reading, and I hope you learned something from me today! What do you think about all this?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Facebook is not cool&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; = Subsequent rebranding and losing relevance &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Tik tok very cool&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; = tik tok becoming the leading social platform for 12 - 45 yr olds.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;The US Office is better than the UK Office&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; = US office now the only one streaming on Aus Netflix.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I must confess, 5 years ago I didn&amp;amp;#39;t hear any of the above. Facebook was (somehow) cool, tik tok didn&amp;amp;#39;t exist and there was stiff competition for which Office series was better. Fast forward to today..&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m teaching my Yr 9 commerce class and they ask &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;sir which crypto do you recommend buying?&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Students no longer laugh on this topic, even 3 years ago they might have switched off. But not now. they are increasingly involved in crypto and are investing in it themselves. This is because it is both relevant and achievable for them to do so.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I own a telegram group where this morning an user entered telling everyone to be quick because today it was starting the private sale of a new coin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I looked at its website and it was clearly made by an amateur. It&amp;amp;#39;s whitepaper was a joke.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However, the devs officially doxxed themselves and most users in their &amp;amp;quot;official&amp;amp;quot; telegram group were starring to believe in this scam.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I noticed some users were clearly fake, saying things like &amp;amp;quot;I follow this project since 1 year and it&amp;amp;#39;s amazing&amp;amp;quot; but I checked and the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;group was created just few days ago so how they were following this project since 1 year ago?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I then decided to &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;contact on LinkedIn the 2 official admins of the project&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. They both answered me that they had nothing to do with it and clearly someone took their names and photos and posted them on that website.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;45 minutes were remaining before the private sale would start. By the way, the private sale was going to work in this way: they would publish a bsc address and everyone had to send bnb at that address. In exchange they would receive back these new tokens.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I posted in their group that admins were liars and that the people listed in the official website were not related to this project in any way.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They accused me of fud, I had no proofs. Also they were deleting most of my messages. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Then I tried what I thought was impossible, because only the worst amateur would make such a mistake: I did a whois of the domain of their website&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; and found out the website was created just 2 days ago, and I found the name and the address of the owner. This guy didn&amp;amp;#39;t even think to hide it properly.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;At this point it was just few minutes before the official launch of the private sale. I simply posted in the group the name and the home address of the scammer and then &amp;amp;quot;if anyone will be scammed, just give this name to the police&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Admins abandoned the group immediately, countdown went to 0 but no private sale started. They literally disappeared and they had no opportunity to scam anyone.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Obviously they were amateurs, it&amp;amp;#39;s harder with professional scammers, but I&amp;amp;#39;m proud that I destroyed the plan of these scammers who invested money and time in creating their website and preparing this scam.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Governments and Central organizations printing money at an extreme rate makes your money worth less day by day.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That‚Äôs where crypto comes in, decentralization is key and also Bitcoin is great for just having 21 million of it ever. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And in other decentralized crypto someone can‚Äôt just ‚Äúprint‚Äù out $1b. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you are in a country that‚Äôs suffering with extreme inflation, investing is gonna help a lot.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Shutting down FB is honestly not that bad (aside of logins associated with it on other sites), but it clearly shows what CEO can do to you and how much power he can have. Now imagine if Google done the same - say, shutting down Google in China for whatever reason (oh wait)...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This should be a lesson to everyone - centralized projects are a risk, no matter if it&amp;amp;#39;s so called crypto, banks, governments or various platforms.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Having no CEO, presidents, ministers solves this. BTC solves this.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Don&amp;amp;#39;t get caught up in the hype which is very rapidly flooding into every person&amp;amp;#39;s social media feed. The success of broader crypto and the individual projects themselves is not going to be decided in a few days; and if a project&amp;amp;#39;s success is solely confined to a small number of green candles, then it&amp;amp;#39;s probably not going to last long; look at its user base, its pipeline, its developers. Of course if the plan is to trade in the short term, look for trends to capitalise of off; but if you are simply looking for a longer term investment, look beyond a bull market (if this is one). There&amp;amp;#39;ll be plenty more green periods to look forward to if crypto truly comes to be adopted at the rate and to the extent it seems it will.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On a separate note I‚Äôve been considering the best way to prepare for these dips and corrections and I‚Äôm wondering about consolidating coins into one or two safer projects that aren‚Äôt as heavily affected when I see a 5-10% dip over say 1-2 days.

Also all the websites have affiliate links for each Airdrops...
So, the question is what Airdrops are for?
Build fake hype
Sell useless/fake crypto, nft or whatever
Accumulate KYC data for future projecs or just to sell them
Rug pull
Pump and dump
Ect...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s better to stay away from all of them, than to send your credentials to every one.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Stay safe&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit : Cosmos and ATOM are the 1% of great airdrops. And please don&amp;amp;#39;t count the old ones during good times, I&amp;amp;#39;m talking about nowadays.. Stop it with BTC faucet, ETH airdrops or Uni swap airdrops years ago.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
