Why? Simple. Because no more than one percent of the world population can ever own more BTC than you. This is really something if you believe that BTC will reach great heights. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There are people saying BTC will eventually hit 1 million. I am not saying it will or it will not, that is another post for itself. All I know is it will go up. That 0.28 stash of yours will increase its own value data by day (in the grand scheme of things). I do not have that much BTC yet but I plan to join the 0.28 BTC group eventually. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Imagine years down the line all millionaires would want to own a BTC and there are not enough to pass around. Your 0.28 BTC value will skyrocket when it happens. So keep staking and lend out your BTC too to let your BTC make more BTC for you. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That will be all folks.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Let me illustrate this, using some of my own life experiences as examples. Here we go:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- Me and 2 friends discover something called bitcoin when it was $40 a pop and litecoin at $2. Poor as church mice we collect all our money and invest it into computers to mine bitcoin. B&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;y our calculations we could make roughly $2000 a month in total. We ended up doing this for well over a year and during this time people laughed at us and we were literally the joke of our university. A year later due to some personal circumstances and letting haters get to my head I sold all my bitcoin and litecoin (±600) for about $100K in total which was a small fortune as a student.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- I use that money to start a business. I had mediocre success and was basically at square one again a couple years later after taxes and other bullshit.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- I go deep into stocks and crypto again, this time I am thinking I have learned from my mistake of selling too early. So now I have invested about $50K in crypto and all is going wonderful until the bear market of 2017 all until 2019 hits me. My portfolio went from $150K to less than $30K during that time and after the gubment raped my ass with taxes I was again, back at square one.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- Meanwhile end of 2019 an acquaintance of mine with the mental faculties of a goddamn baboon had gotten a small inheritance a couple years before that and bought a house. Due to an inflated market he had cashed out selling his house in 2019 and had a couple hundred thousand lying around. He puts it into crypto, and about a year later he cashes out most and is now a multimillionaire.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- In 2020 I had again, after slaving away, a bit of cash invested in the markets again. This time I am sure that I need to take profit again sooner. I now do insane due diligence on stocks and crypto and my portfolio goes from $20K to $200K. I take some profit and think all is well, then november comes around and it is basically down 75% from that. And I had ZERO clown crypto or stocks at this time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- I did however, just for shits and giggles, bought $2K worth of shiba before it went nuclear. My reasoning was simple; people are so fucking stupid that next to doge I am sure they will buy another fucking dog coin. That turned out to be true and that $2K turned into $18K. I cashed out all of it. If I had held it, it would have been worth $800K.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;WHY am I sharing this? The only difference in the people making it and not making it is often LUCK. and NOTHING more. Holding shit for 10 years is a great strategy, until it isn&amp;amp;#39;t. Cashing out is a great strategy, until you realize you were WAY too early. Playing it safe and diversifying is great, until life happens and you need to cash out for whatever reason. Do not be fooled; most of the people who got rich in crypto got lucky. Nothing more. That especially goes for influencers in this space.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;May luck be on your side.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

They mail you a card (and link a card using Apple Pay if you have an iPhone) and then you simply just use that as opposed to your normal debit card. Transferring from your bank account to your Coinbase account is literally instantaneous. It’s quick, easy, and convenient. If you’re on the fence, just get one!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/a/WYhTK1H/&quot;&amp;gt;Proof of over $500&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: Forgot to mention. It’s 4% cashback on every purchase&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Game developers such as UbiSoft are shoving NFTs down gamer&amp;amp;#39;s throats, and they hate it, gamers ridicule it saying it&amp;amp;#39;s the worst thing that ever happened to video games in recent history,&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Turns out Melania Trump sold her own NFT to herself to boost the price giving NFTs a bad rep,&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Majority of regular people when asked about NFTs say they are stupid, and most of them don&amp;amp;#39;t even understand what NFTs are, don&amp;amp;#39;t believe me? Ask your coworkers on Monday about what they think about NFTs,&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Even big YT channels such as Linus Tech Tips make fun of NTFs almost in every single episode of Tech Linked,&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;General population is fed up with NFTs,&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Even South Park makes fun of NFTs. If you are in a South Park episode you should know you&amp;amp;#39;ve messed up big time,&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;People use NFTs to make a quick buck congesting the networks all the time increasing fees,&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Right now we have thousands of different NFT collections and 99% of them are a worthless pieces of crap.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto space has become a laughing stock due to NFTs. It was cool and awesome when people were just buying cute meme coins for lols, but NFTs pushed it too hard and now people are fed up with them and start to hate them and start to hate the entire crypto space in general. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The biggest enemy of crypto space is the crypto space.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Change my mind.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: To clarify, the tech itself is great, but it should be used to verify medical records, house ownership, verifying votes, verifying IDs etc. but not for selling pictures of rocks. It just makes crypto space looks childish and nobody will take us seriously until a real-world use case can be provided.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I took some screenshots of generic websites. You&amp;amp;#39;re probably familiar with most of them, and searched common products. Then I simply conducted conversions to the current price of Bitcoin. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It turned into a fun activity where I was basically modifying websites to show what they could look like in the future. Of course, since they are showing the price in the current value of BTC, they will look a bit different when the world undergoes the inevitable mass adoption. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I could have chosen any crypto to do this of course, but with the takeup from some countries already, the currency of the future is more than likely to be bitcoin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

This is a light hearted crystal ball shill post about the best performing crypto
in 2022.

Backstory: I bought Luna at $5.8 and Sol at $29 in around March 2021 and was

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is a light hearted crystal ball shill post about the best performing crypto in 2022.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Backstory: I bought Luna at $5.8 and Sol at $29 in around March 2021 and was excited to sell a couple of days later Luna at $9 and Sol at $36. You can imagine how I felt when Luna topped at $100 later in the year and Sol went to $250. Hey I made profits but FML.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The current market situation is a mix between interesting and boring as we don&amp;amp;#39;t know what will happen next. Bitcoin is going between $42-45k for a while now and can go either way imo. Let&amp;amp;#39;s hope that it will go up to the much desired $100k mark and then Lambos for everyone. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So now I have been looking at my crystal ball/glass and its empty again but it also starts speaking to me and I get the feeling that Atom and DOT is doing very well in 2022. 
CRO might also overtake Binance as the most popular trading app and if that happens, we might see another 5-6x.
Tezos is doing really well already and with all their partnerships in particular Ubisoft, this could go up big times.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What crypto are you excited about in 2022?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

So here is some history.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The 2000 SuperBowl was known as the DotCom SuperBowl - it marked the spectacular top and was followed by the crash of the entire dotcom market, sinking many of the companies that advertised there. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Super_Bowl_commercials#2000_(XXXIV)&quot;&amp;gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Super_Bowl_commercials#2000_(XXXIV)&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some of the infamous companies to advertise in 2000 SuperBowl include AutoTrader dot com, Britannica, Computer dot com, epidemic dot com, hotjobs dot com, MicroStrategy, OnMoney dot com, pets dot com etc. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Many of these companies died or ended up being acquired on the cheap by bigger entities. Even the ones that survived like MicroStrategy went through a 90% correction in asset price and had multiple decades before even beginning to recover in price. MSTR is still below its 2000 highs. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Nasdaq took 14 years, from 2000 to 2014 to recover to the same levels as the 2000 tops. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;SuperBowl advertisements dont mean jack shit. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I like to think I&amp;amp;#39;m in it for the tech, and I think most of my investments reflect that (I&amp;amp;#39;m pretty much all in on ETH at this point), but of course I&amp;amp;#39;d like to make money. And as everyone knows, the best way to make a quick buck in crypto is to flip sh*tcoins. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So here&amp;amp;#39;s my question: if I had the chance to make a 10x, but in order to do so I had to buy a token that is clearly a ponzi, would I do it?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m not talking about a project with utility that could fail ; I&amp;amp;#39;m talking about a genuine cash grab.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On one hand, I wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t feel so good about participating in this kind of operation. It&amp;amp;#39;s the kind of things that gives the entire ecosystem a bad reputation. But on the other hand... This is a free market, and if people want to throw their money at me without DYOR, then that&amp;amp;#39;d be their fault.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All things considered, I think I would not do it. But I&amp;amp;#39;ve never been tested, so it&amp;amp;#39;s easy for me to say this.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I was wondering what do you think about this. Would you sleep well doing a 10x knowing other people got scammed? Would you simply refuse to participate?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Not only can users send funds instantly and for free to any other cash app user but also to any strike user or lightning wallet on earth. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is how network effects start. Now all cash app users are compatible with all strike users and LN wallet users. Once venmo plugs into lightning all venmo users will be compatible with all cash app, strike and LN wallet users. At this point if you use any other app like paypal or transferwise or wechat or your banks online banking app you are not part of the network. You are not part of the group of people all connected to each other on lightning, and you are stuck within your one single app unable to interact with all of the people on the open lightning network. All you can do is send money to other people who happen to use the exact app you are using. Thats like only being able to send email to people who use the same email provider you use.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One by one apps plug into lightning and network effects take hold. If you don&amp;amp;#39;t offer lightning compatibility you are essentially cut off from the world.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All of a sudden 10 of the largest financial and social apps and their 2 billion users are all on the lightning network and all freely transferring money between each other instantly and at no cost. If you are a merchant do you keep only accepting visa essentially alienating anyone using any financial app? Or do you download a lightning compatible POS app so any of those 2 billion people can pay you from their app of choice. You are a business person so you figure out how those 2 billion people can pay you from whatever app they use by making sure your business POS system is lightning compatible. All of a sudden people are paying you using messenger twitter whatsapp IG venmo cashapp and strike and you no longer need to pay visas extortionate 2% transaction fees so your profit margin doubles.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Its at this point anyone accepting visa looks like a dinosaur trying to only accept checks.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This all plays out within the next 24 to 36 months.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The world is about to change for the better.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Here&amp;amp;#39;s a fact for you all, viewership of the superbowl has been consistently going down for more than a decade since 2010. So less people are watching the game in general. About half of those people are just there for the ads and a majority of them are gonna be sharing the ads on Facebook, a social media platform that didn&amp;amp;#39;t grow last period and has an aging userbase to boot. So less people and mostly older that aren&amp;amp;#39;t gonna take financial risk are watching. I doubt Auntie BJ is gonna invest in crypto because Tom Brady told them about FTX. I can see my brother who uses facebook and has no teeth left seeing the ad and wanting to FOMO in. So that&amp;amp;#39;s the audience they&amp;amp;#39;re mainly getting.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s also just Americans. No one in Europe is gonna be watching the game and or gives a shit about Tom Brady. No one in Brazil is gonna be watching. Americans are not the only people invested in crypto, most South Koreans have no idea how American football works or again, gives a shit about ads that they wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t understand without subtitles and who is gonna be writing subtitles for ads for an American sporting event outside of Spanish and English?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Lastly, why would the news care about a crypto ad? Do you expect an interview with Tom Brady breaking it down his involvement and a full history on the past year of crypto? I&amp;amp;#39;ll bet they will talk about how much is spent on the ads this year and how much FTX grew and paid Tom Brady and then move on with their day.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This idea that a single ad during an American sporting event is gonna put us into a bull run is just silly. This is Saturday Night Live or Doge day again. There&amp;amp;#39;s no reason to think prices will go up except for hope. But they wanna cover their tracks and say it&amp;amp;#39;ll affect the prices in future. Okay, I drank coffee this morning and so the prices will go back up &amp;amp;#39;someday&amp;amp;#39;, that&amp;amp;#39;s my prediction based on nothing substantial.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

That means banks took over $12 billion dollars from people with no money during a global pandemic.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My bank takes between $50/70 dollars in overdraft fees every quarter. 
Yearly APY on my saving account is so bad that it’s actually never worth it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I staked most of my crypto which gives me back so much more than my robber of a bank that when crypto goes mainstream we are saved from these robbers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I do need my bank account because I have not a lot of other choices to pay for stuff or receive. I did learn to stake my savings after buying stable coins with it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cant wait for massive crypto adoptions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: I am debt free as of next month. I got lucky with a coin people on /CC dislike a lot. I sold it on it’s all time high and bought back at the recent crash and set aside the amount I needed for my debt. Next month is the last payment :)
I wont make the same mistakes again.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit 2:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I actually said I dont want to be able to overdraft day one 1 signed there. I guess they did it wrong but at that moment I didnt bother changing it. Which was dumb&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

This is going to be the single biggest advertising advent reaching the largest number and demographics of people that crypto has ever had.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Do I believe that just seeing these adverts is going to double our portfolio&amp;amp;#39;s tomorrow? No.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Do I believe that there is going to be any significant price action tomorrow? Certainly not!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Do I believe that tomorrow is going to be a focal point for the average public to talk about crypto? Yes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And what happens every time the public take an interest in crypto? The media always follow through with more reports, articles, predictions etc and the larger investor, realising that the public are likely to start FOMOing in buy up the lower price quickly. And the more attention crypto gets the harder retail predictably starts FOMOing in which causes a feedback loop pushing prices sky high until large investor money swoops out of the market and crashes the price again.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So from the charts tomorrow will look like any other day but looking back from the future I bet my sats that it is the beginning of a significant upswing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: I apparently have to add that I&amp;amp;#39;m not American, I just appreciate the power advertising to retail especially one of the most lucrative retail markets of Americans that have on average the most disposable income and are the most likely to invest (as they have to as they have no social programmes!)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
