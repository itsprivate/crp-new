According to what is being upvoted here, DOGE has died a million times and &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;never&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; would surpass even one cent, while SHIB does not even have a &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;chance&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; of entering the top 30. On the other hand, Banano, the one meme coin this sub likes, is hovering around market cap rank 1,000 and doesn&amp;amp;#39;t really want to pick up.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;11 days ago, ApeCoin was listed on many major exchanges. And don&amp;amp;#39;t get me wrong, I personally would never buy it - even in the speculative world of crypto, meme coins are a bit too risky for me, and Bored Apes look horrible and I don&amp;amp;#39;t get the appeal. But I still thought it was funny how the hive mind decided right at release that it &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;hated&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; the token, that it would fail immediately with 100% certainty, at that every negative thing about it would be upvoted massively, no matter how misleading or plain wrong.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One week ago, there was a &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/tij5jr/apecoin_is_down_more_than_20_in_a_day_this_might/&quot;&amp;gt;short but very dramatic post&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, saying that it went down 20% in a single day - nothing too weird for a new coin - and that this was the last warning before the &amp;amp;quot;real dumping&amp;amp;quot; starts, and that &amp;amp;quot;Everyone knows that project gonna dump hard&amp;amp;quot;. Nobody can predict the market, but a hard dump soon after release was always pretty unrealistic, considering it builds on a pretty well known brand (everyone has heard of those disgusting Apes) and the tokens the founders and BAYC holders received are locked for a pretty long time. But, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/cc&quot;&amp;gt;r/cc&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; being &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/cc&quot;&amp;gt;r/cc&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, of course it received 3.8k upvotes because &amp;amp;quot;APE bad&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Since then, ApeCoin has gone up more than 50%. And sure, it&amp;amp;#39;s generally a green week, but currently it is ranked 3rd of the top 100 coins, so it grew much more than most others.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;I have no idea how ApeCoin will do in the future. It might become as big as SHIB or even Doge, or it might slowly lose value over time and leave the top 100 at some point. I know I won&amp;amp;#39;t buy any. But this is a good reminder that this sub, on average, is terrible at predicting the market, especially when it comes to meme coins. Once this sub decides to hate a coin, it will ALWAYS be convinced its end is near. I don&amp;amp;#39;t have any advice for you, except: don&amp;amp;#39;t take positive posts about this sub&amp;amp;#39;s favorite coins or negative posts regarding its least favorite coins too seriously.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

What&amp;amp;#39;s more ridiculous is that these guys explain why investing in crypto is bad whilst drinking expensive coffee,  wearing ridiculously expensive branded clothes etc.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I buy crypto instead of buying stupid stuff. I buy crypto instead of buying expensive alcohol,  or a pack of cigarettes. I buy crypto instead of buying a $200 sneakers. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I wish people realize that we invest in crypto cause we got some goals for which crypto is the only way. That&amp;amp;#39;s why I refrain from talking about crypto with anyone. They won&amp;amp;#39;t invest. First they&amp;amp;#39;ll judge us, then they&amp;amp;#39;ll burn in jealousy if we make money out of it or they&amp;amp;#39;ll ask for us to teach them. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This just piss me off, like alot. Yes there&amp;amp;#39;s risk in buying crypto, atleast it&amp;amp;#39;s better than burning money for ridiculous  things.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I used to care a lot about fundamentals and utility when I was investing in coins but now I just don&amp;amp;#39;t see the point of caring about fundamentals. Some person creates a shit coin and pays influencers to shill his coin in order to create a fake hype and boom, that coin is in top 20 without any use case and utility. Excuse me but what the fuck?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We almost lost our most important values, fundamentals, utility, a good dev team etc.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In a market where shitcoins sit easily in top 20 without any utility/use case, no one cares about fundamentals anymore.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Finally, I was out of these stocks and could buy assets I believe in. But I was stupid and greedy. The crypto market was going up and I wanted to wait for a red day to buy. It wasn&amp;amp;#39;t even that much of a difference, but since it was a large amount of cash (for me), it just felt better psychologically to buy on a dip.   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But the dip never came. 42k never dropped to 41. Instead it has been shooting up everyday all the way to 47 now and beyond. If I just would have bought at 42k, I would be done, happy, and not feel like an idiot for trying to time the market.   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So don&amp;amp;#39;t be me in the future. Don&amp;amp;#39;t try to time the market in hopes of getting a slightly better price (unless you are an expert trader, which I am not). The best way to make money in this crazy market is to buy the best cryptos (BTC, ETH, and maybe a few top L1s) and chill.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Ethereum climbed up past $3.2k with its next resistance around $3.5k.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The US FED has promised to lower their monthly purchases of stocks and bonds, and is also starting to increase interest rates back from it&amp;amp;#39;s long 0% rate during the pandemic. This should put some downpressure on most stocks now that it isn&amp;amp;#39;t effectively &amp;amp;quot;free&amp;amp;quot; to continue to borrow massive amounts of money.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Obviously there&amp;amp;#39;s still a lot of uncertainty in the global markets with the war in Ukraine, but I don&amp;amp;#39;t see crypto taking any worse of a blow due to fear than regular stock and ETF options.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;China is also dealing with their massive housing financial crisis, which isn&amp;amp;#39;t made any better bycurrent events.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With inflation at all time highs (and is NOT transitory, likely to keep increasing) crypto is proving it&amp;amp;#39;s a necessity for storing value outside of fiat currencies.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I mean seriously what was the last time we saw ADA making double digit gains nearly everyday and goddamn VET pump 30% in one day.

What people mean by this is that the protocol does not provide payouts to active nodes. This is in fact true. And while there are many valid counter arguments being made about whether payouts to nodes are necessary, these counter arguments seem to forget one crucial thing: &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Bitcoin does not provide an incentive to run a node.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Yes I wrote that correctly. The Bitcoin protocol provides absolutely no payout for running a node.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now I know what you are thinking. “Yea it does, miners get paid”. But that idea is missing an important detail: Miners are not nodes and nodes are not miners. Sure most mining pools also run nodes, but you can also mine without running a node. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What is a node? A node an entity that listens to network information (blocks, transactions, etc) from the other nodes that it is connected to, and relays that information to the nodes that are connected to it. A node listens to blocks and transactions, and relays those blocks and transactions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In order to be a miner the only network interactions you must make are to: listen for blocks and transactions, and to send out the small percentage of blocks that you mine to one or more nodes. In order to qualify as a node, you would also need to relay blocks that you didn’t mine.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The next logical counter argument is “why bother differentiating if all the mining pools run nodes anyway”? And this is a very good point. So good in fact, that it’s the philosophy upon which Nano is built. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Why do all the mining pools run nodes? Because it is convenient to do so. They are already listening to blocks and sending out occasional block solutions, so why not just relay all the blocks to listeners and run a full node. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Miners are just players in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Just like people who pay using bitcoin are players in the ecosystem. Just like Bitcoin exchanges and businesses that accept Bitcoin are players in the ecosystem. For some of these players it is convenient to run nodes, and for others it isn’t. Most people who buy stuff with bitcoin do so infrequently enough that it is not worthwhile to run a node full time. But most exchanges handle so many transactions that they may as well run nodes of their own. That is why most exchanges do, in fact, run their own nodes. Just like a lot of bitcoin businesses do. These nodes are what keep the bitcoin network alive. Without nodes there is no mining. Mining is nothing more than bitcoin’s solution to the byzantine emperor problem. The existence of nodes is a product of the convenience of doing so.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And this is the idea behind Nano. If a business wants accept Nano for goods and services, they would most likely want to listen to transactions on the Nano network to be aware of money received. So just like the Bitcoin miners, they may as well relay those transactions along in the network, and run a full node. Likewise exchanges would want to run their own nodes for the same reason. And guess what, they do. Just about every exchange that accepts Nano runs its own node. People run Nano nodes for the same indirect incentives that make people run bitcoin nodes: Its convenient.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I can go on about how Nano’s voting system works synergistically with the indirect incentive to run nodes, but this post is getting long and that’s a topic for another post. But can we finally put this argument to rest? Network players do not need a direct payout to be incentivized to run nodes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;TLDR: Nano provides no incentive to run a node, but neither does Bitcoin.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I was obviously prepared for spam bots etc. But still the amount of people that claimed that their low-cap coin, no one knows about with a 100M market cap or so, is 100% safe was just outrageous.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Many claimed that some low-cap coin they invested in will definitely be successful in the future and is actually 100% safe. The sad thing is that many seemed like they are not even a bot. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Maybe that Crypto won&amp;amp;#39;t crash into disappearance and actually survive but there is absolutely no guarantee that it will be profitable, especially with low-cap coins. That&amp;amp;#39;s why it&amp;amp;#39;s: higher risk, higher rewards.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Obviously a low cap coin no one knows about could possibly end up being very successful for you. So investing is not wrong. But you should know that there are probably hundreds of Cryptos doing the same thing, solving the same problem. So it&amp;amp;#39;s very hard to find something legit and uniquely new nowadays in Crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Google issued the warning on its official Chrome blog, revealing that Chrome on Windows, macOS and Linux is vulnerable to a new ‘zero-day’ hack (CVE-2022-1096). Zero-day is the most dangerous form of attack because it means the vulnerability is known to hackers before Google could issue a fix. As the company admits, “Google is aware that an exploit for CVE-2022-1096 exists in the wild.” This means every Chrome user is vulnerable.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The issue seems to be quite serious, as it&amp;amp;#39;s the only change in this build.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

When I was researching what cryptocurrency to buy, I decided I wanted a crypto that had the best balance possible of the following attributes:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;1. Decentralization&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; - Censorship resistance is the most important aspect of cryptocurrency&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;2. Environmentally friendly&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; - Consume minimal wasteful energy&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;3. Scalable&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; - More TPS = better&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;4. Fairly distributed&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; - This is important to prevent creators from dumping on the buyers&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;5. Fast&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; - Faster transactions are more convenient than slow transactions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;6. Low transfer fees&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; - Cheaper fees to send = better&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;7. Low inflation&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; - Inflation devalues existing coins and creates potential sell pressure.  It also incentivizes spending which is bad for the environment.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Below is a description of Nano in regards to the above attributes:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;1.Decentralization&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Nano has hundreds of nodes.  The below image shows the decentralization of the bitcoin mining pools.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/oanw3jskzrp81.jpg?width=715&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=dcf0c42ba2ca00dfc9c4bbb34d2e31dbb0e10eb4&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/oanw3jskzrp81.jpg?width=715&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=dcf0c42ba2ca00dfc9c4bbb34d2e31dbb0e10eb4&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And this image shows the Nakomoto coefficient of Nano.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/4smhpo0mzrp81.jpg?width=605&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=715bae19f06a67ed9fd2af2fec4d61a11e66402c&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/4smhpo0mzrp81.jpg?width=605&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=715bae19f06a67ed9fd2af2fec4d61a11e66402c&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;2.Environmentally friendly&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Nano is as environmentally friendly as they come.  Nano does not have mining.  Below is a visualization of Nano’s power consumption compared to Bitcoins.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/mpxrlc0ozrp81.png?width=1155&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=ad3981cde3af2df12ffc726fef8ccbae4100322a&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/mpxrlc0ozrp81.png?width=1155&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=ad3981cde3af2df12ffc726fef8ccbae4100322a&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;3.Scalable&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Nano does not have a hardwired limit on scalability (aka transactions per second).  Instead, Nano’s transactions per second are limited by hardware and bandwidth.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;4.Fairly distributed&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.nano.org/the-nano-faucet-c99e18ae1202&quot;&amp;gt;Nano’s distribution&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; was not perfect, but it was very close. 95% of the Nano supply was given away for free for solving captchas.  Approximately 5% was reserved for the development of Nano.  It is estimated that about .2% of the Nano supply is still in the development fund.  It is extremely important to have a fair distribution.  Without a fair distribution, founders of cryptocurrencies could rug pull and sell the tokens they own, thus crashing the price.  This image shows just how much better Nano’s distribution is than most cryptocurrencies:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/4ehzhfbpzrp81.jpg?width=761&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=8585f04432c7e1a48b63f720975a3d33b64a1f0f&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/4ehzhfbpzrp81.jpg?width=761&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=8585f04432c7e1a48b63f720975a3d33b64a1f0f&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;5.Fast&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Nano transactions reach &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;finality&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; in about .3 seconds!  This is incredible.  If you deposit Nano to an exchange, most exchanges will let you instantly trade and withdraw the funds.  This is unlike a lot of cryptocurrencies which pretend to be instant, but exchanges know they can’t trust the funds until x confirmations, which takes anywhere from seconds, to minutes, to hours, depending on the currency.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;6.Low transfer fees&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Nano is feeless!  Here is a visualization that compares Nano’s fees to other coins.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/g7bo24fwzrp81.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=a65ae739b57073df57048b745636d92f292b85a6&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/g7bo24fwzrp81.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=a65ae739b57073df57048b745636d92f292b85a6&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;7.Low inflation&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Nano has no inflation.  This is phenomenal.  Unlike most PoW and PoS coins which constantly have new coins getting minted, no new Nano will ever be minted.  This is phenomenal because at $40K per Bitcoin, $36 million dollars in Bitcoin is minted every single day.  A lot of this Bitcoin has to be sold to pay for mining costs.  This is constant sell pressure on Bitcoin’s price which Nano does not have!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Below is an image that compares Nano’s inflation (and other features) to other coins.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/gm9nxhcyzrp81.jpg?width=2047&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=fd42a4aa9243c8f711eaa31c70f5c0e73365323b&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/gm9nxhcyzrp81.jpg?width=2047&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=fd42a4aa9243c8f711eaa31c70f5c0e73365323b&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One complaint I have heard about Nano is that it does not have smart contracts.  This was an intentional design feature of Nano.  By being simple, Nano is able to have faster transactions and less chance of exploitation (to this day, Nano has never had a double spend).  I also personally believe decentralized finance is the number 1 use case of crypto (it is Bitcoin’s sole use case), and Nano does it better than any other cryptocurrency.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Here is a video showcasing Nano:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR9U32u8ulE&quot;&amp;gt;Nano in the Real World: Lightning Fast | No Fees | Global Payments&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Disclaimer:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I did my best to post accurate information.  If I made any errors, please let me know.  This is not investment advice.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Edit 1:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One of the main concerns people posted is that since Nano is feeless, people are not incentivized to run nodes.  This is incorrect.  Bitcoin has mining fees and miners are paid to mine bitcoin.  However, Bitcoin also has nodes and Bitcoin node operators are paid no fees (they get none of the mining reward).  Yet, thousands of Bitcoin nodes are run by people to verify the ledger.  Nano nodes, like Bitcoin nodes, also verify the ledger.  Since running a node is a way to verify your holdings, businesses and people are incentivized to run them.  Just like with Bitcoin, finding enough people to run nodes has been a non-issue for Nano.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That’s how it’s going to be with crypto wallets, right now we all have multiple apps of multiple wallets, Coinbase, Kraken, Binance, all of them, but that will be a thing of the past.        &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Similar to how I can tap my side button twice and pay with the debit card that I connected on Apple Pay - soon I will be able to do the same thing and pay with a choice of assets, my Bitcoin, my stablecoin(s), or my debit card.             &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It’s just a matter of time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Do you really want THIS to be your &amp;amp;quot;only way&amp;amp;quot; to change your life? The ground you are building on is a pretty shaky one, mate.
But there is a great upside to this! It does not take much time to bet on crypto. Don&amp;amp;#39;t chase every pump, inform your self periodically, invest what you can lose and you are golden. Now you can take time and actually work towards a goal you have some control over! Even if it seems hopeless and you fail, there is always something you will take from it. Constantly try to evolve in even the smallest things. I know how easy it is to resign yourself to your perceived &amp;amp;quot;faith&amp;amp;quot;, but by doing it you lose all the chances you never knew you had.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
