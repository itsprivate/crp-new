&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They just transferred all their BTC out of their wallet, probably going to dump it on the market in order to try to save UST.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Good luck to everyone who put money in UST. It will probably recover this time around because they got the BTC to sell or lend, but this just proves that UST isn&amp;amp;#39;t the great stablecoin that this sub portraits it at.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Be careful with UST going forward, this definitely won&amp;amp;#39;t be the last time that it&amp;amp;#39;s briefly losing it&amp;amp;#39;s peg and one day it might not recover.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: 37,000 BTC that originated from the Luna foundation wallet is being transferred to Gemini exchange&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Lets just look at the bloodbath right now&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/ky9skqra7hy81.png?width=1616&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=feb5d44fd0a0903353c467b27d7a6a7bd51caa54&quot;&amp;gt;The market right now&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;BTC - ATH is $68,789.63 and the current price is 33,279$. When we reachieve ATH, that will be over 100% increase. Which means you are doubling the money that you are putting in by buying now.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Similarly with ETH. ATH is $4,891.70 and the current price is 2,413$. Again when we reach ATH, you are looking at a 2x of what you have invested.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But those of you who have money but haven&amp;amp;#39;t bought BTC at this price, in the hopes that&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The price will go even lower. That is Greed. You aren’t even taking this opportunity now to get a 2x, then trust me, every time it goes lower, you will wait for a new low. And when prices rebound, you will still wait for the “crash” only to finally fomo near the top.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The market is too volatile, I might lose my money. Well, this is crypto. You should invest what you can afford to remove maybe a year or two later. Don’t imagine Bitcoin to make you a millionaire overnight. But if you invest too much, it can make you broke in no time as well.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The potential of BTC is over. I need to find the next 1000x ultra micro cap coin. Well if you are colorblind, the market is red now. Good luck finding an alt coin that statistically might not survive the bear market.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TLDR - Agreed that crypto is volatile as hell. But within this space, the most safest and blue chip investment are at prices which will net you double the returns.  What is stopping you from investing at least a portion of your investment money now ?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The likely explanation is that investors are moving money away from stocks and crypto into fiat, precious metals and other low risk options. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Rising inflation, rates, supply shortages, war, a pandemic are all combining to create a perfect storm.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I am confident that in the long term we will see crypto roar back as it always does. So long as you stick to holding through the storm (even if you are at a significant loss) the charts historically show that you will come out on top in the long run.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Let&amp;amp;#39;s be honest though, it&amp;amp;#39;s easier said than done. As crypto is so volatile and the majority of holders are sitting on significant losses, it might be tempting to panic sell at a loss.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But I firmly believe if we hold, DCA with whatever spare change we have, we will all come out much wealthier when crypto inevitably bounces back.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now this is the great opportunity for those who believe in crypto. Probably the next bull market will be crazy than ever and a crypto market crash is the best opportunity before the enxt bull market starts.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The reason for that is because assuming bitcoin successfully becomes the honest transparent base layer that we need so desperately to replace the dishonest fiat/debt base layer--which nothing built over can ever achieve honesty--then changing the 21M hard cap would simply cause everything outside the money (products, services, credit markets) to adjust to the new block subsidy and BTC float. Thusly, the incentive to change it doesn&amp;amp;#39;t exist. This was really more of a refutation of FUD &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;(But the limit can be changed!)&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; and thought experiment than it was any probability.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I based this on economics 101, and more closely, on bitcoin mining. If for example, bitcoin spiked to $100k tomorrow, what would happen? Would an ASIC stay at the price it is today, which is about $10k for an S19j? No. It would increase roughly by whatever the BTC price increase is and then price itself with the next difficulty adjustment and current hashpower, along with the price entropy associated with an always approaching halving. I&amp;amp;#39;ve noticed that when you include this stuff, mining has actually consistently beaten my spot BTC buys over the long run by a few percent.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So this all figures into my $400k price call. If you got a $100k spike tomorrow, would BTC maintain itself there? Absolutely not, because that would be at odds with everything rational to do with money. Why? Because efficient miners would be sitting there making $80k per BTC. Their BTC stockpiles would be worth a tremendous amount. ASIC owners would be sitting there with insane hardware appreciation. What do you think happens here? Same thing that eventually happens in every commodity market over time--the gap would get closed, arbitraged, miners would do huge share offerings, even I&amp;amp;#39;d sell my S19&amp;amp;#39;s, the difficulty adjustment would rocket, every student with a laptop would be syphoning their dorm and library&amp;amp;#39;s free electricity to mine. The price would drawdown, because we are very early in BTC&amp;amp;#39;s monetization phase.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But before you freak out, here&amp;amp;#39;s what bears always forget:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There are two sides to that. This holds true for not just the move up, but the move down as well. So when you have baseload energy prices along the lines of &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;$8 per cubic foot&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; or &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;$110 per barrel&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, you have hashpower increasing relentlessly, difficulty adjustments going up, constrained supply chains and miners HODLing, how long can the price stay depressed? Not long. That would be at odds with everything rational to do with money.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Look at the major miners. Are they selling? Nope. Decreasing their hashpower. Nope. Read their 10k&amp;amp;#39;s. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/u/Riotblockchain&quot;&amp;gt;u/Riotblockchain&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; is active on this sub and they just announced in a post last week a 1GW expansion, literally at the same moment the press dropped elsewhere. Here&amp;amp;#39;s all the US majors plans 2022:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/rgxttjcv6dy81.png?width=649&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=193bcf52457e106096140dccb78ea17488189685&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/rgxttjcv6dy81.png?width=649&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=193bcf52457e106096140dccb78ea17488189685&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;THAT. IS. JAW-DROPPING.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; This to me says a 10x is likely the peak which also happens to be about gold&amp;amp;#39;s market capitalization give or take. Will it hold? Absolutely not, probably a drawdown of 50%-60% like we see currently. Bitcoin doesn&amp;amp;#39;t target a stable price, it targets a variable price. It can control the supply and issuance, then the market determines what the price is. That&amp;amp;#39;s what a free market looks like. Bitcoin is in the long, difficult, and organic process of absorbing the world&amp;amp;#39;s trust (and thus its value). When it&amp;amp;#39;s absorbed enough, the confidence curve (and thus its volatility) will flatten. Many projects think they can magically skip this step. There&amp;amp;#39;s only one crypto category that can: stablecoins. That&amp;amp;#39;s why nothing inside altcoin protocols have ever established themselves as money, except stablecoins. Which is why 85% of all altcoin volume is from stablecoins--a percentage that is growing monthly. You ever look at the graph of stablecoin growth? At this rate it&amp;amp;#39;ll be bitcoin at #1 and stablecoins making up the next 4 spots in 5 years. If you add bitcoin&amp;amp;#39;s mkt cap dominance with the mkt caps of stablecoins, you get 74%. But there are 15,000 altcoins... Talk about an example of &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Gresham&amp;amp;#39;s Law.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; This is why you don&amp;amp;#39;t touch anything but bitcoin, because here&amp;amp;#39;s another prediction:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fiat trouble is climbing the ladder from small to mid, and might now be just reaching the Japanese Yen already. There are many currencies which are more volatile than BTC. This WILL reach the USD&amp;amp;#39;s rung in the next 24 months. When that happens a credit market will rapidly develop around BTC, and also, stablecoins are in a world of trouble in the shadow of BTC&amp;amp;#39;s next halving, and altcoins are in even more trouble. Entire protocols can get completely de-collateralized when stablecoins wobble on their pegs and arbitrageurs are nowhere to be found, because volume spikes will make transactions unaffordable, and because bitcoin will emerge as collateral. And collateral is money, as we&amp;amp;#39;re starting to rapidly learn with the Ukraine crisis and commodities. This more than regulation in my opinion, will be the s-curve adoption shakeout we&amp;amp;#39;ve been waiting for, much to the chagrin of the web 3 shills--apologies if you&amp;amp;#39;re a holder of these things with mega-lottery environments built around them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This post is written as a chicken-noodle soup of sorts for the BTC holder&amp;amp;#39;s soul, because volatility is hard to digest especially for noobs, but counterintuitively, it proves BTC is working, and it makes hedging quite expensive, which brings its own protective benefits in this free market. So you HODL, buy, repeat. You listen to the heartbeat of the only truly free market asset in existence, and ignore the mainstream talking points. Bitcoin&amp;amp;#39;s longterm chart is a tale of highs and lows. But between that is a relentless and healthy uptrend. Why is that? Thanks for reading.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Bought 2 BTC for $900, sold them for $1000 and thought I was a genius. Didn’t take it too seriously. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After trading them for awhile and doing more research I started thinking crypto could have a really bright future. Then I woke up one day in 2017 and BTC was jumping to 2k. I frantically bought that morning with all the money I could spare. I could feel the FOMO coursing through the investment community. Bitcoin was national news and on CNBC everyday after being mostly ignored for years.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Shortly thereafter, it went to 19k and I was walking around town like a God amongst mortals. I told all my friends and family to buy some crypto. I begged them. I was so cocky I put 100% of my IRA account into GBTC at $29/share. Why not? BTC was going to the moon and there would be no detours along the way. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then I went to lunch a few days later, checked the price and it had dropped to 17k. No biggie, I thought, of course there needs to be a correction after this run up, it’ll bounce back. A few days later it was 15k. Okay, I thought, just some more profit taking by short term investors, this’ll stop soon and we’ll be at 30k in a month. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The next two months we’re a torturous gauntlet of small bounces of hope followed by spirit crushing dips, sleepless nights and poor mental health. I capitulated and sold half of my stack at 6k/BTC just so I could take a break from thinking about it and “get my old life back.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For the next 2 years I kept advocating for crypto and wishing it would rise as it became less and less relevant in the news once again. It bounced around 10k again for awhile and finally landed down at 3k during the Covid crash in March 2020. My GBTC position and my IRA was down 95% to $3/ share. I laughed to myself looking at the account balance on my screen and said out loud “Ha! Space cash?…What the fuck was I thinking?”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Of course we all know that was the start of the next bull market and we ended up at 68k. I DCA’ed every chance I could over that 2 year period and I ended up with about 50% more crypto as I had before I sold half in 2017. I still DCA today as we have drifted back down to 34k, a 50% drop from ATHs.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The message and point of this story is:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Allowing myself to feel depressed or super excited about the price over the last 6 years has been a complete waste of my time. I could’ve just set an automatic recurring buy order my exchange account and gotten drunk or been in a coma and I’d be elated with the results right now if I had never checked the price. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The drop allowed me to increase my crypto position. Dollars or euros don’t matter, what matters is increasing your crypto stack. We all know it’s just a matter of time until it’s $680k/BTC. Guess what? It’ll probably drop to 340k then too. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is the crypto game. My story is not unique. Losing 50%+ of your money is a right of OG crypto hodler passage, so welcome to the club of this is your first time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hang in there.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I really thought we would encounter at least some greater real world usage by now, but atm we only have ponzi like DeFi Apps, NFT that suck all the &amp;amp;quot;usage&amp;amp;quot; and copycats all over the place. I seriously thought crypto would have a better impact by now or at least some useful usage, kinda disappointed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Most tokens feel so useless, a lot are just made for governance, but really how is that decentralized? A centralized system where everyone can only vote once is way more fair than a decentralized governance where the biggest whales dictate everything.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And if they are not only made for governance, they are made for staking/farming aka ponzi like tactics, which is very short term. Most of the DeFi apps can function well without the token and just use the native token they operate on, but the team behind it just wants to milk as much as possible so they create a token and give high APY to make it &amp;amp;quot;useful&amp;amp;quot;. High APY where they give the same token you stake is never going to end well. Don&amp;amp;#39;t ever hold these tokens long term.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then we have all the copycats. If you have one dApp or chain that&amp;amp;#39;s &amp;amp;quot;successful&amp;amp;quot;, everyone is copycatting it. Just look at the amount of EVM compatible smart contract chains, it&amp;amp;#39;s getting out of hand. Or STEPN which attracted a decent chunk of users, got copied straight after and so many more examples...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Pretty much all smart contact chains have the same dApps trying to milk every DeFi user there is. Most unique dApps still come from Ethereum and they all get copied to the cheaper chains.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto projects like STEPN are P2E games, all these games are made for short term. Enjoy the gains while it lasts, because the unlimited high emission is going to kill every P2E game. They also attract a TON of bots, so you pretty much are competing with perfect human like players.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then we have countries that are pretty much dictatorships that &amp;amp;quot;adopt&amp;amp;quot; bitcoin, while in reality they just buy bitcoin with the money they steal from their country. Statistics already show these countries aren&amp;amp;#39;t adopting bitcoin in anyway. Also very funny how you see a posts here in front page about some house being sold for BTC for the first time in a country. Like really? Bitcoin has been around for so long and we are proud because of one single private transaction? Lmao.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So really, what did crypto achieve that&amp;amp;#39;s really something to show off with? Curious to see others opinion.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For me this is an easy buy not necessarily currently but anytime I buy I know that with in time my money will double in the future on any buy below this price. Lots of altcoins out there looking very tempting as well, but one thing I have learned is Id rather have a large portion of my portfolio in BTC when things are on there way down. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is a time were you hold solid projects that you truly believe will succeed long term because it will take time for the market to recover. Fill your bags now&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We&amp;amp;#39;re in a bear market. Shit sucks. But that doesn&amp;amp;#39;t mean we can&amp;amp;#39;t still have some fun right?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For those that were around at the beginning of the year, you might remember that I created this. The FOLIO OF HATE. I invested (yolo&amp;amp;#39;d?) $100 into this subs most hated coins. Some coins are hated because of utility, some because of corruption, some because of the the shills. Whatever the reason, I decided to act on the theory that this sub can actually pick winners by investing into the ones that we all hate the most.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So, $100 was invested on the same day to each of the ten coins/tokens. Here is how it fared.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/nfz7ezwmz8y81.png?width=991&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=d0ac739a8375280fe14e47eb7564c5a1d6d7fc0e&quot;&amp;gt;Folio of Hate&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Down 46% or $460 in five months.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What about the individual results? Surely they&amp;amp;#39;re not all bad? Right?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Best performer:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; USDT -0.01 %&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Worst performer:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; LRC -70.13 %&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Surprise Performer:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; DOGE -31.01%&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Personal points of interest:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Investing in Dogecoin - yes Dogecoin - was a better investment than Solana, Cardano, Ripple and Binance.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Safemoon was not the predicted worst performer ...yet.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Tether - FUCKING TETHER - was the folios best performer. Props to &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/u/entschida&quot;&amp;gt;u/entschida&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; for getting that one right.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I am aware that perceptions and opinions shift over time, so it is of course possible that we hate these coins more than ever. Oh, and fuck you Crypto.com&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Original post from &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rng996/here_it_is_the_subs_most_despised_coins_combined/&quot;&amp;gt;five months ago&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Well after a long and exhaustive battle of coins being shilled in just a couple of hours, I have found the list of the subs most hated coins. There was definitely a lot of hate out there. I put $100 into each and stored it on a seperate group of wallets to my real bags. To make it easier to track, I create the folio of hate using coinmarketcap to track them more easily. I&amp;amp;#39;ll post the updates every month and hope to see some big gains going against us all (even my most hated coin is in this group).  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There was a lot of hate from users, towards some coins more so than others. The two most hated were the most hated by a very long way. Merry Christmas everyone!  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The final list in order of most votes and comments is listed in the comment below because the filter won&amp;amp;#39;t let me create a post with that many coin names in it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Benjamin Cowen is one of the few people I follow and I enjoy his content. It&amp;amp;#39;s sad to him say his theory of lengthening cycles is dead, because it made the most sense. As an asset gets bigger, it obviously takes more money to move it up hence more time. Also, every Bitcoin cycle has seemed like it was progressively getting longer if you measure it from cycle bottoms.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/ym1kycwyl8y81.png?width=595&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=77e259cb883425ccc915974eb75452c90cf84073&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/ym1kycwyl8y81.png?width=595&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=77e259cb883425ccc915974eb75452c90cf84073&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/mc0c80fwm8y81.png?width=589&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=0560ebfc99b268861e9bc617644a307749ff8417&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/mc0c80fwm8y81.png?width=589&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=0560ebfc99b268861e9bc617644a307749ff8417&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What he says makes sense, even if we were to somehow pump up from here it wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t erase all this downwards movement we had to go through. It would be hard to classify the past 2 years as part of the bull market. If the high inflation numbers and the situation with the FED wasn&amp;amp;#39;t a thing, I think his theory would have been correct. What do you think?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s getting ugly out there.
Bitcoin is down over 8% this week and has fallen nearly 50% from last year&amp;amp;#39;s all-time-high. The situation isn&amp;amp;#39;t much better for Ethereum, down 5% over the week, while newer best-of-breed coins like Solana (SOL), Terra (LUNA), and Avalanche (AVAX) fell over 10% this week. Things haven&amp;amp;#39;t looked this bad in a while, and it&amp;amp;#39;s going to get worse before it gets better.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But don&amp;amp;#39;t be alarmed. Like the meme of the dog in a bowler hat sitting in a house on fire: This is fine.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Before getting into why things will be (mostly) fine, let&amp;amp;#39;s take a look at what&amp;amp;#39;s causing crypto to melt down in the first place.
The primary culprit is the global macroeconomy. Governments around the world are being walloped by inflation levels not seen in 40 years, and central banks are finally taking measures—like jacking interest rates and shrinking their balance sheets—to fix this. Unfortunately, this has meant taking away the cheap money punchbowl that has powered decades of surging stock and real estate prices.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The result has been a wipeout in both stocks and crypto (Bitcoin is more closely correlated with the Nasdaq than it&amp;amp;#39;s been in ages) and fear among investors. Meanwhile, other global events—from the war in Ukraine to new Covid lockdowns in China—are fueling further sell-offs and adding to the sense of unease. 
In these circumstances, is it any surprise people are flushing their Shiba Inu tokens? Many crypto enthusiasts, and Bitcoiners in particular, like to believe blockchains will supply an alternative financial reality when the world goes to hell, but it&amp;amp;#39;s clear that&amp;amp;#39;s not (yet) the case. Crypto is as prone to macroeconomic shocks as everything else.
Meanwhile, the crypto industry itself has become a bubble waiting to pop. Pick your example—from the glut of worthless Layer 1 chains to fly-by-night NFTs to Floyd Mayweather&amp;amp;#39;s latest pump-and-dump. There&amp;amp;#39;s a lot money being squandered in stupid ways. That&amp;amp;#39;s fine as long as there are enough &amp;amp;quot;greater fools&amp;amp;quot; out there to buy that garbage, but when the music stops, it&amp;amp;#39;s going to look a lot like the ICO fallout of 2018.
We might be at that stage again now. Paradoxically, though, the current carnage we&amp;amp;#39;re seeing should be cause for optimism.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Since the birth of Bitcoin, the crypto industry has been marked by spectacular booms followed by painful crashes. If history repeats itself—and I&amp;amp;#39;m betting it will—the impending downturn will serve as a healthy cleanse and reboot for the industry.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That&amp;amp;#39;s what happened in 2013 when the price of Bitcoin brushed the once jaw-dropping figure of $1,200, only to plummet afterward. It took years to reach that level again, but in the interim, something remarkable happened: dedicated teams put their heads down and built a series of innovations that transformed the industry. By the time the next boom rolled around in 2016, crypto had gone from being just Bitcoin and a handful of altcoins like Litecoin and XRP to encompass smart contracts, utility tokens, and a multi-chain future.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A similar thing happened after the bust of 2018. When crypto came roaring back in 2021, the technology had changed profoundly. A series of stylish NFT platforms had eclipsed the primitive CryptoKitties of the previous boom, DAOs took off for real, and the entire plumbing of the industry had become far more sophisticated.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s going to happen again. Just as in the past, the dilettantes and hustlers will move to some other shiny thing, while the real crypto believers will stick around to lay the groundwork for the next era of Web3.
It&amp;amp;#39;s hard to predict exactly what this next era will look like, but a good bet is that it will feature low gas fees, easy-to-use Layer 2 options, and NFTs moving to the core of the music and entertainment industries. It&amp;amp;#39;s a
fun future to imagine—provided you have the stomach to get through another Crypto Winter.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Finally hit my goal of 1 BTC.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Been hearing about Bitcoin since 2009, Thought it&amp;amp;#39;s farmville money. I had a GPU that could mine hundeds of Bitcoin a week in 2011 but I rather played Call of Duty with it. Till 2021, I didn&amp;amp;#39;t give a damn about what Bitcoin is but now it is all I research about (watching Greg Foss for Hopium, What Bitcoin Did for philosophy and money Benjamin Cowen for TA)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Started stacking sats from Jan 2021, flipped some shitcoins, DCA&amp;amp;#39;ed monthly into stacking via the lightning network and finally arrived here.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Used to hold it in a single account ledger wallet, but did not feel safe because of dictionary attacks. So, now HODLing into sparrow multi sig wallet (2 of 2 both Ledger Nano X). Stored my seed phrase safely burned underground in my backyard in a layer of concrete. HODL mode on!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Best of all, its KYC free.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Well, on to the next goal of 2 BTC.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Crypto is in it full &amp;amp;quot;mania&amp;amp;quot; stage as the rise of meme coins takes place lead by the godfather of memes, Dogecoin itself. Dogecoin hits about 0.70 crossing the magical 0.69 mark. It&amp;amp;#39;s just complete doge hype all over the internet. Investors are already seeing the 1$ mark in front of their eyes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here we are one year later. Since then DOGE only was in a downtrend from 0.70$ to 0.12$. Reasons are the overall Crypto dump but also fading interest and hype in the crypto itself. Which they are even trying to tackle right now with actual development and a roadmap. But this is not about doge. This is about not being too overconfident with your investment.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Being to overconfident will lead you to the blinded HODL. While holding may be a very good strategy in crypto its not always. Some cryptos rise others disappear you have to look into the market to know where your investments are heading.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If your crypto look weak over the longterm you should take the profit or if your crypto has done an unsustainable pump you should take a profit. Taking profit is not bad, it&amp;amp;#39;s smart and wise, also you always have the option to buy low afterwards.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Bitcoin price, past 6 months; (down 43%)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitcoin&amp;amp;#39;s price has dropped 43% over 6 months.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here are the some most popular growth stocks&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Netflix (down 72%)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIUrE7Ovm5k&quot;&amp;gt;In the latest Coffeezilla video&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, our intrepid investigator finally confirmed that John Karony, the CEO of Safemoon, definitively owns the infamous &amp;amp;quot;Gabe&amp;amp;quot; wallet - the BSC wallet that ends in &amp;amp;quot;6abe&amp;amp;quot;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I might make a future post about this, but a quick summary is that the Gabe wallet bought a &amp;amp;quot;Moondog&amp;amp;quot; NFT, which John then tweeted about, and also wrote an instagram post about moving it. He also attended Austin SXSW and received an exclusive NFT that is transferred to your wallet for attendees only.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This (among other evidence) was the smoking gun and confirmed John&amp;amp;#39;s ownership of said wallet, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;which was previously highlighted as problematic as it has been receiving millions of dollars from Bitmart which was supposed to be sent to the liquidity pool&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, and yet these funds are being withdrawn as cash or spent on frivolous items.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;hr/&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With that out the way, we know that Karony owns this wallet, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/6zSJko3&quot;&amp;gt;and he received a tip off from the slimy Ben Phillips&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; to buy some shitcoin called &amp;amp;quot;Stonks&amp;amp;quot;.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://bscscan.com/token/0xb966150c7a0150ed4ea979e04f18d109301aab95?a=0xd51d1d5503dcff819e214faa66c3b6f0ebb06abe&quot;&amp;gt;On that same day, Karony bought $150,000 worth of Stonks&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, becoming the 2nd largest token holder.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Unfortunately, John&amp;amp;#39;s investing savvy is secondly only to his FUD-fighting savvy, and his FUD-fighting savvy is fucking awful, and so I regret to say that his $150,000 worth of Stonks tokens are now... alas...  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;$5,107.46..&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;That&amp;amp;#39;s a 96.6% loss.&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;hr/&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If this was his own money, who gives a shit. But to actually misuse taxed funds from investors which was supposed to go into the liquidity pool to help secure price stability of Safemoon, in order to buy cringey worthless NFT&amp;amp;#39;s and hundreds of thousands of dollars of shit tokens is a new low.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Especially considering Safemoon currently has a very serious liquidity issue. With just over $6m in BNB liquidity left, it only takes a couple whales to drain the LP and slam the door shut on everyone else.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
