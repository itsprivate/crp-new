It was designed to prevent large institutions from being “too big to fail” and being bailed out when economic hardships happen while the common people are left in the cold. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;not&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; meant to eschew laws or take down tyrannical governments. Honestly, having an immutable ledger of where you stole something and sent it to is probably poor form anyways.  It was never intended to be a political revolution either. It was trying to be free of inflation and corruption by a single or a few entities who could determine if transactions are approved with ulterior motives. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For all the people who think crypto entitles you to fund criminals or be criminals yourselves, why? What makes you feel so entitled to these feelings? Have you created your own cryptocurrency?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: didn’t know this was gonna be so controversial. If you wanna do illegal shit with crypto that’s cool, but you also have to be aware that what you’re doing is still illegal and you’re subject to penalty if caught.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/cdr62ff7jqi81.png?width=960&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=f5752413a7cf7e6d0ddfa796b830cfd24f0baa18&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/cdr62ff7jqi81.png?width=960&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=f5752413a7cf7e6d0ddfa796b830cfd24f0baa18&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He&amp;amp;#39;s a legendary investor at Wall Street.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
This man was named the head of the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Magellan Fund&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; at 1977 when he was 33 years old, which had $18 million in assets. He ran it for 13 yearsm, which allowed him to retire at 1990 at the age of 46, when the fund had grown to over $14 &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;billion&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; in assets. The fund annualized return was at  29.2%, more than twice the S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 at that time - which means that he &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;consistently beat&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; the market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After his retirement, this legendary investor switched to philantropy and only managed his own stocks.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So, I&amp;amp;#39;m reading Peter Lynch&amp;amp;#39;s book called &amp;amp;quot;Beating The Street&amp;amp;quot;, where he talks about his investiments strategies, the way he thought during critical momments and the market and so on. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While I was reading, I&amp;amp;#39;ve found this:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/erv8jkzwkqi81.png?width=799&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=fe3ddb1735f46a2236537cf890307cc8b11e9053&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/erv8jkzwkqi81.png?width=799&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=fe3ddb1735f46a2236537cf890307cc8b11e9053&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And then he proceed to argument that in many times that apparently the world would end, the market had some big crashes and then recovered and everyone was fine. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This made me think about the whole situation we are now. I mean, there&amp;amp;#39;s Putin going berserker at Ukraine, Biden saying that Putin certainly will attack it, interest rates going up, COVID has a new variant, truckers at Canada and Trudeau being mad...... basically, we are all gonna die.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Or maybe we are not gonna die and we&amp;amp;#39;ll be fine. We might even be missing some buying opportunities. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To finalize this post, I&amp;amp;#39;d like to quote Peter Lynch again:  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/c7eolmbllqi81.png?width=850&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=585f1db16cf74e02ca9da7ae632be98866d0322e&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/c7eolmbllqi81.png?width=850&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=585f1db16cf74e02ca9da7ae632be98866d0322e&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We will all be fine. Just turn off the TVs and analyze this situation clearly.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Wish you all best and sorry for any english mistakes, its not my first language.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Punk 6529 made a post on twitter that got 20,000 upvotes about why the precedent Trudeau is setting is completely dangerous and unsustainable, and he did it without being bias towards the truckers. I deeply underestimated how progressive crypto reddit is. The core developers, core exchange CEO, and entire fintwitter and crypto twitter are drastically more conservative and libertarian than this, and virtually all of the infrastructure they have built is to attempt to slow down the government, any government for that matter from behaving the way in which Trudeau is now doing, &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;yet here I see 600 comments on a thread with 1200 upvotes by someone going &amp;amp;quot;Hey maybe Banks having this power is a bad idea&amp;amp;quot; -- 600 comments defending KYC, defending CeFi, defending Pfizer, defending Ciphertrace &amp;amp;amp; Chainanalysis &amp;amp;amp; Elliptic, and defending Banks engaging in this behavior, and your willingness to trust the administrative state to not backdoor your crypto without due process, despite you literally defending the abrogation of due process. It makes me sick to my stomach. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The intention of crypto was Monero, and specifically the separation of state and money, not to recreate Web 2 on chain, with thought crimes and Black Mirror surveillance like China, on chain, not for your stupid pumpanomics, not for your willingness to comply with these insanely censorious regulations that merely recreate the entire SWIFT system and US Sanctions Regime onchain, which they by the way use to do extremely imperialist, racist things on the regular. You people are utter fools.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I’m not sure what they mean by “exclusively curated NFT” launches (on what basis is it curated?) but given that other platforms have everyone and their mothers launching NFTs, I’m up for something that is a little more handpicked. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Part of this package is the SMAK governance token which could go shoot up if the launchpad does well. I’m getting some just in case, because screw it, I’ve missed out on too much&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On a side note, I’m also growing open to the fact that newer NFT platforms might do better. Don’t get me wrong, OpenSea and the rest will still have a strong market presence but I think we’ll see some outflow as newer gen launchpads come up with better features and checks, kinda like how solana, fantom, bsc took some influence away from ethereum.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The DCA part does the job of taking out the emotions, and the “buy the dip” is to utilize the time to make your cost basis even lower (DCA down). In a time like this, it’s the worst idea to sell low. If you want to sell and take profits, you would have been doing it way back in Nov or early Dec last year. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now if you are not selling low, you’re halfway to success. You don’t want to do this:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/5yebj72b1oi81.jpg?width=934&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=53e793bd4abe054a1dbb1166c5e6ab12ada1c751&quot;&amp;gt;Please don&amp;amp;#39;t do this! &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But anyway, today I’d like to talk about &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;HOW&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;to buy the dip&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, because I have heard of it so many times here, but no one says how to do.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;The two types of mistakes in a downturn&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Panic buying and run out of fiat too early:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Let’s say you have always wanted to buy more of something but can’t wait, so you go all in the first dip. As usual, the dip will dip lower. You realize you have run out of fiat and hate yourself for missing out lower dips.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The overly pessimistic:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; You listen to a bear on the daily and they said (like in July 2021) BTC is going to $16k or even $12k! You keep waiting in Aug, Sep and realize the market trend has reversed! BTC was going up again. You have missed the chance!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Ideally, you don&amp;amp;#39;t want to be either of these types. It&amp;amp;#39;s impossible to catch the exact bottom, but even getting 10% close to it as a &amp;amp;quot;buy the dip&amp;amp;quot; purchase would be great!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Look at the big picture&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/qoha2can1oi81.png?width=1916&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=bf193efd3a253cb01d1c49b6422eb22d70fe7b05&quot;&amp;gt;Market entry cost basis broken by band. Full credit to @ TheRealPlanC on Twitter.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As you can see, there are various strong holders with cost basis between $36,380 to $41,872. Failing that, a relatively weaker one of $35,008, then a series of between $32,262 to $33,635. If it goes sub $30,889 there is almost no bull defense until $26,770 – that’s why we frequently hear “for the bear, it will have to trigger all the stop losses all the way down to $27k”. Never say never, but BTC going down to $16k or $12k is quite remote, unless there is an extreme black swan event.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Contrary to the popular belief, it usually takes weeks or months to confirm trend reversal, not a couple of days. Why? Crypto is often regarded as “riskier” than other asset classes, thus in a downturn, it will usually be one of the first to be sold. Thus, on the way back to recovery, it will require tremendous volumes over some time to confirm the trend reversal.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The big picture includes the financial market outside of crypto. The most noticeable is S&amp;amp;amp;P 500, NASDAQ and news about interest rate. And then we should not ignore the elephant in the room, such as Russia-Ukraine.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;How low the dip will go? – market indicators&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After we know that the market conditions would translate for (at least) several weeks in the “underwater” mode, it’s time to find the support bands. That would be one of the bases for setting price that trigger the dip buying orders.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Find the support bands:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; If you go to Tradingview and select the daily candle for BTCUSD pair, you will find some areas acting as support bands – kind of like a floor that prevents the price being dragged down further. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/dhh7bq5k2oi81.png?width=1449&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=dbaabf9944f1bb0cffaab9e96750d95ac60958a8&quot;&amp;gt;Tradingview - BTCUSD pair&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you’re not familiar though, several people can tell you the support bands. For example, Ben Cowen recently uploaded a video for the bear case. Sally Ho from Crypto Daily identifies the following downside objectives: $39,927 =&amp;amp;gt; $39,394 =&amp;amp;gt; $38,527 =&amp;amp;gt; $38,316 =&amp;amp;gt; $37,869 =&amp;amp;gt; $35,982 and $35,698 areas. Just now we are testing $39,927!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Relative Strength Index (RSI):&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;  Usually if RSI is less than 30, it’s a better time to buy. The lower it is, the larger amount I will buy accordingly.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/lnprbq5g3oi81.png?width=1888&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=7608e88045bc7b5edac9fef309a48a6bdd0f806f&quot;&amp;gt;The most recent time when RSI for BTC fell under 30 is 24 Jan 2022. That&amp;amp;#39;s a local low of $33,556. This is from Coindesk.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There is a website that tracks RSI instantly as well as many other market indicators in which you can track on Investing.com =&amp;amp;gt; indices =&amp;amp;gt; Bitcoin Real Time Technical.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/djwimigv3oi81.png?width=823&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=29774b616e7ccbe78c4c7c81e6dfd5aad766308d&quot;&amp;gt;Investing BTC indicators - you can see RSI is 34.061 now.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Whale watching:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;  When you start seeing the whales have started buying, it is also something worth considering. One of my most recent watch is the third largest address. Of course, this is just relative though. Whales make mistakes too, so don&amp;amp;#39;t take it as 100% signal. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/sxqq6wf64oi81.png?width=1920&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=f7c5bf719a6feb4da193a040eb4d37dc18fd4e13&quot;&amp;gt;Bitinfocharts - the third largest whale. As you can see here, this whale last buy is 274 BTC @ $37,260 on 04 Feb 2022. It has stayed on the sideline in the last 2 weeks.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Action: Set reducing buy orders, don’t go all in the first dip&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After having an idea about the scope of the dip, it’s time to put into action. The lower the price, the bigger the order. For example, if I use the support bands above.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/1r3u2fhk4oi81.png?width=278&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=ddcebcf6d619352eeed5aec83e7dec6b5271ebcf&quot;&amp;gt;Just an example. Again, this is up to your risk averse level. You may say, well my cost basis is $38k so I won’t start buying again until it hits $37,800. But this way you can make sure you still have fiat to buy if the dip goes lower. Never go all in the first dip.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;And of course, this is not financial advice, but that’s my strategy, along side dynamic DCA. What is yours? I would like to hear please.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Word of caution though, correlation does not imply causality so if two things correlating we can&amp;amp;#39;t say for sure if they are influencing each other or is there another hidden variable.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Method&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;:  I download all the data from Yahoo finance for Bitcoin, S&amp;amp;amp;P500 and others.  Included in the download was also ethereum, gold and VIX. VIX is the &amp;amp;quot;fear index&amp;amp;quot;.  The merged data starts from 2017-Nov so that is where we would start.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Results of correlation for the entire range&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/kskr569b8gi81.png?width=664&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=fd4d6b30a3b57c2e5cf9644c20968c5e42abdff9&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/kskr569b8gi81.png?width=664&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=fd4d6b30a3b57c2e5cf9644c20968c5e42abdff9&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;each cells contains a correlation coefficient of the comparisons. A perfect  correlation is 1, 0 is no correlation and -1 is anticorrelated, meaning if 1 goes up the other goes down.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;we see that S&amp;amp;amp;P correlates very well with Nasdaq, at .9 which is almost perfect.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;S&amp;amp;amp;P is anticorrelated with the fear index aka VIX and does not correlate with gold. Making gold a good hedge.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;However for the entire range, S&amp;amp;amp;P only has a correlation of .23 with BTC.  This is statistically significant &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;but weaker than I would expect  so I dug a little further and ran correlation for each year&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/coqcah739gi81.png?width=129&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=86e936c0d0cf346723b98e7b1ebbbc4ef3969db5&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/coqcah739gi81.png?width=129&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=86e936c0d0cf346723b98e7b1ebbbc4ef3969db5&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So as you can see the the correlation seems to be going up starting in 2020. There used to be no correlation but something happened around this time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Next I ran a correlation month by month to detect any trends.  And it was again surprising that the each month the correlation changes so drastically, with some months even in in the anti correlated portion, meaning BTC is moving in the opposite direction.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/m2scttpe9gi81.png?width=1456&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=7b14df097fab38a977248030a8588d1acc0d7569&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/m2scttpe9gi81.png?width=1456&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=7b14df097fab38a977248030a8588d1acc0d7569&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Vertical dotted grey lines demarks years. Color green is when correlation &amp;amp;gt; 0 and red &amp;amp;lt; 0.  The black horizontal lines is set to 0.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Summary&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The idea that BTC  has increase in correlation recently is only partially true as you can see even in 2017 there were months with high correlations. Thus the correlation between BTC and the market seem to change on a monthly basis.

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Although on a global trend, the correlation is menacingly getting higher.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;there were some months were BTC was actually anticorrelated - at this point then it would be a perfect hedge for the stock market. The lowest months were the following. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Note that its usually in the summer time&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/lajmfkh4agi81.png?width=253&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=a9946a9e27ea104823c2af5a3e53b425965c4295&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/lajmfkh4agi81.png?width=253&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=a9946a9e27ea104823c2af5a3e53b425965c4295&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here are the months with the highest correlations and interestingly this is usually in the winter time. hmmm. interesting.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/h49cetvmhgi81.png?width=239&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=063c5d8577b40f17e45876224e8609d6db9c7128&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/h49cetvmhgi81.png?width=239&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=063c5d8577b40f17e45876224e8609d6db9c7128&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TLDR: correlation of BTC with the market seem to change month by month and in some cases its even the opposite however year over year the correlation does seem to be going higher.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There was a post by Kraken founder about new Canadian legislation and I saw one very interesting and alarming reply on the comments. One of his followers just replied Jesse that Kraken may be put in position to freeze our assets without judicial consent and will probably comply to that request. Jesse just 100% agreed with that person and on top of that suggested to keep funds away centralized exchanges.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I think it&amp;amp;#39;s the first time we see any CEX CEO suggesting  to move away our funds from centralized custodians.  We should definitely appreciate the man for raising alarm and being so honest even though it may harm his business.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We are currently using the default criteria for all governance polls, which says a poll passes if the Moons voting in favor represent over 50% of the participating moons and exceed the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/community-points/documentation/reputation-and-governance&quot;&amp;gt;Decision Threshold&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However, this was the criteria meant for changes to Moons, but not necessarily governance of the subreddit, such as rule changes.  This criteria is a very high bar because Moons should be difficult to change, but isn’t necessarily the best for subreddit governance.  For example, should &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/poll/qh2l1z?utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=usertext&amp;amp;amp;utm_name=CryptoCurrency&amp;amp;amp;utm_content=t3_qh2l1z&quot;&amp;gt;the poll about live posts&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; with 83% approval have failed?  Conversely, in a contentious situation like &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/oylpp9/reduce_the_karma_value_by_50_for_the_daily/&quot;&amp;gt;the poll on the daily discussion&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, should a poll with record breaking 12.9 million moons but only 52% approval be successful?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Solution&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We should adopt new criteria for successful subreddit governance polls:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;2/3&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;rds&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; supermajority (66.6…%) of participating moons voting in favor&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;50% of the Decision Threshold voting in favor&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;At least 1,000 votes&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This will treat subreddit governance polls differently from Moons governance polls, which will retain the same criteria they currently use. Moons governance polls are ones which change Moons themselves, such as karma weight, membership prices, or the distribution (&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/wiki/ccip&quot;&amp;gt;CCIPs&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, and 27).  These are typically things only the admins can change.  Subreddit governance polls are ones which change how the subreddit operates and are things the mods can change (CCIPs 5, 8, 12, 17, 19, 21, 26, and 28)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Reasoning&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These values were chosen based on &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xY2DD2bCKSCySFrXdsaE0Ow-ocM0HSs9T6jZ4_6-zCA/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&amp;gt;historical voting data here&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/tfvsn7c3bfi81.png?width=741&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=ae9dff4cdb1e017ebcc203a73dd5009fdf0c2a68&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/tfvsn7c3bfi81.png?width=741&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=ae9dff4cdb1e017ebcc203a73dd5009fdf0c2a68&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When considering governance, we want to set criteria that ensures polls pass when they have enough support, but not require so much support that we end up with gridlock where nothing can pass. The Decision Threshold, or &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/quorum&quot;&amp;gt;quorum&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, should be set so that a sufficient number of voters are present and a poll is not sneaked through without the majority knowing.  Similarly, quorum should not be unreachable where you are gridlocked from passing any polls.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I chose these figures because the low approval requirement and high participation requirement of the current systems are leading to good polls failing.  Polls which achieve over 2/3&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;rds&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; support are popular enough that they should be implemented and should not require and artificially high quorum.  However we do not want controversial 50/50 polls to pass, even if they do have high participation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The quorum requirements have been linked to the Decision Threshold because it dynamically adjusts according to the amount of moons in circulation.  The number of votes was increased from 500 to 1,000 based on community feedback in ccmeta.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Welcome to your monthly no-shill data dump: Here&amp;amp;#39;s the 49th monthly report for the 2018 Top Ten Experiment featuring &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BTC, XRP, ETH, BCH, ADA, LTC, NEM, DASH, IOTA,&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Stellar.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;tl;dr&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;What&amp;amp;#39;s this all about?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven&amp;amp;#39;t sold or traded, reporting monthly for over four years. Did the same in 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;here&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Snapshots taken on the 1st of each month.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;January Highlights:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;  (crickets)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Overall since Jan. 2018:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;ETH&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; solidly in the lead, followed by &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BTC&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;ADA&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, the only three in the green.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;2018+2019+2020+2021+2022 Combined Top Ten Portfolios are returning 224%.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Reminder: I&amp;amp;#39;m focusing mainly on the 2022 Top Ten Portfolio this year and will release one other bonus update per month on a rotating basis. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Month Forty-Nine – UP 4%&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/fqkjno1z5ji81.jpg?width=939&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=69b83bb2e4f564346525afc6d789432f3c5d9212&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/fqkjno1z5ji81.jpg?width=939&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=69b83bb2e4f564346525afc6d789432f3c5d9212&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Portfolio is &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BTC, XRP, ETH, BCH, ADA, LTC, IOTA, NEM, Dash,&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Stellar&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;January highlights for the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A rough start to 2022 and the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;second 100% red month in a row&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Bitcoin&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; (-18%) falls the least.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;ETH&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; maintains a solid overall lead, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BTC&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; in second place, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;ADA&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; in third.  Only these three cryptos are in the green since January 2018.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The 2018 Portfolio drops -30% in January, now just +4% since January 2018&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; and well behind the S&amp;amp;amp;P 500’s ROI over the same time period.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;January Ranking and Dropouts&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here’s a look at the movement in the ranks since January 2018:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/temsfw736ji81.jpg?width=406&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=976f2b628fad278e6fdd065c9474fa3de3bc233d&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/temsfw736ji81.jpg?width=406&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=976f2b628fad278e6fdd065c9474fa3de3bc233d&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Top Ten dropouts since January 2018:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; After four+ years of the 2018 Top Ten Experiment, only 40% of the cryptos that &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/&quot;&amp;gt;started in the Top Ten&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; have remained.  &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;NEM, Dash, Stellar, Bitcoin Cash, IOTA&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Litecoin&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; have been replaced by &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Binance Coin, Tether&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;DOT, SOL&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;LUNA&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;USDC.  NEM&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; looks like it wants to be the first to drop out of the Top 100.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;January Winners and Losers&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;January Winners&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; –  100% red month, but &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Bitcoin&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; dropped the least, ending January down -18%.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;January Losers&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; –  &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;IOTA&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, dropping -38% this month.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Tally of Monthly Winners and Losers&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After forty-nine months, here’s a tally of the monthly winners and losers over the life of the 2018 Top Ten Experiment. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/x444xoc66ji81.jpg?width=415&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=4ec6e2bedb557270570fd6ce5af8adeca79d3abb&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/x444xoc66ji81.jpg?width=415&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=4ec6e2bedb557270570fd6ce5af8adeca79d3abb&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With 12, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Bitcoin&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; has three more monthly wins than second place &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Cardano&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.  &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;NEM&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; has finished last place most often (12 months out of 49).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Bitcoin&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; is still the only cryptocurrency that hasn’t yet lost a month since January 2018 (although it has come very close a couple of times).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Overall Update –  A bloody start to 2022. Overall ETH in first place, BTC is second place. Dash in last place.&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After reaching an All Time High (+72%) in &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-46&quot;&amp;gt;October&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio continued to lose value.  After four years of holding these cryptos, only 3 out of the 10 cryptos are in the green: &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BTC,&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;ETH,&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;ADA.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Overall, first place &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;ETH&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; (+285%) is well ahead of &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BTC&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; (+193%) and third place &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;ADA&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; (+60%).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The initial $100 invested in first place &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;ETH&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; four years ago?  It’s worth $386 today.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;DASH&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; is at the bottom, down nearly -91% since &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/&quot;&amp;gt;January 2018&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;  The initial $100 invested in &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;DASH&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; forty-nine months ago is worth about $9 today.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Total Market Cap for the entire cryptocurrency sector:&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/jnwd1kn96ji81.png?width=582&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=86f05288589b3d9750278a9ca483846f2441e911&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/jnwd1kn96ji81.png?width=582&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=86f05288589b3d9750278a9ca483846f2441e911&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;End of January 2021 market cap: &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$1,773,545,018,753&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The total crypto market dropped significantly in January.  That said, crypto as a sector is up +208% since &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/&quot;&amp;gt;January 2018&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There was no easy way to achieve this at the time, but if you were able to capture the entire crypto market since New Year’s Day 2018, you’d be doing much, much better than the Experiment’s Top Ten approach (+4%), the return of the S&amp;amp;amp;P (+70%) over the same period of time, and nine of the individual cryptos within the 2018 Top Ten (except for &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Ethereum)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto Market Cap Low Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$114B in&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-thirteen/&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;January 2019&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto Market Cap High Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$2.65T in&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-46/&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;October 2021&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Bitcoin dominance:&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/g0b69nkb6ji81.png?width=487&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=0855ec69693427885b1069d5e007158e15329ece&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/g0b69nkb6ji81.png?width=487&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=0855ec69693427885b1069d5e007158e15329ece&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BitDom&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; ticked up one percentage point in January, ending the month at 41.2%.  When looking at the entire four year 2018 Experiment time frame, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BTC&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; dominance is near the low end.  For context:   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Low Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;33% in January 2018&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;High Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-twenty/&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;70.5% in August 2019&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2018: &amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/dzik21kc6ji81.jpg?width=340&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=5226e53ab2f3057f5e16ba0b99a9a31671f1b7eb&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/dzik21kc6ji81.jpg?width=340&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=5226e53ab2f3057f5e16ba0b99a9a31671f1b7eb&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The 2018 Top Ten Portfolio lost -$306 in January.  Believe it or not, December was slightly worse for this portfolio (-$325).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If I decided to cash out the 2018 Top Ten Experiment today, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;the $1000 initial investment would be worth $1,035&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, up 4% from &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/&quot;&amp;gt;January 2018&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Green is unfamiliar territory for the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio and a recent development.  Over the first four+ years of the 2018 Index Fund Experiment, thirty-eight months have been in the red, with only eleven months of green.  All eleven of the green months have come in 2021/22. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here’s a look at the ROI over the life of the experiment, month by month, since the beginning of the 2018 Experiment four years ago:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/qqw0snxf6ji81.jpg?width=760&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=0976074dcd6d26331aaaa245aab3d558cd69c328&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/qqw0snxf6ji81.jpg?width=760&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=0976074dcd6d26331aaaa245aab3d558cd69c328&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The all time high for this portfolio is &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-46&quot;&amp;gt;October 2021&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; (+72%).  The lowest point was in January 2019 when the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio was down &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-thirteen/&quot;&amp;gt;-88%&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Remember: no one can predict the value of any crypto tomorrow, let alone next month or next year.  The 2018 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio was down -88% after one year, -80% after two years, -25% after three years.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Alright, that’s that for the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment recap.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But I didn’t stop the Experiment in 2018:  I invested another $1000 into each of the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;2019&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;2020, 2021,&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;and&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2022/&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;2022&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; Top Tens as well.  How are the other Crypto Index Fund Experiments doing?    &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-49&quot;&amp;gt;2018 Top Ten Experiment&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;: up +4% (total value $1,035)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;2019 Top Ten Experiment: up +364% (total value $4,639)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;2020 Top Ten Experiment: up +577% (total value $6,766)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;2021 Top Ten Experiment: up +201% (total value $3,009)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;2022 Top Ten Experiment: down -25% (total value $747)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So overall? Taking the five portfolios together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom bottom &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;bottom&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; line: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;After a $5,000 investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; the combined portfolios are worth &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$16,196.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;That’s up +224%&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; on the combined portfolios, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;down from&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-47&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;November’s all time high of +553%&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiments.  Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/8m9uctlj6ji81.png?width=600&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=60e62c5720dff1128ee607c445c6c853c596e704&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/8m9uctlj6ji81.png?width=600&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=60e62c5720dff1128ee607c445c6c853c596e704&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;That’s a +224% gain by investing $1k in whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for five years in a row.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Comparison to S&amp;amp;amp;P 500:&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I’m also tracking the S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 as part of the Experiment to have a comparison point with other popular investments options.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/nxudx2vn6ji81.png?width=582&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=5d7305ca4e89e11fe0a5d71b45112afdc86c7416&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/nxudx2vn6ji81.png?width=582&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=5d7305ca4e89e11fe0a5d71b45112afdc86c7416&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 is up +70% since January 2018, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/&quot;&amp;gt;January 1st, 2018&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; would be worth $1,700 had it been redirected to the S&amp;amp;amp;P.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;$1000 investment in S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1,700 today&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;$1000 investment in S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1,810 today&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;$1000 investment in S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,410 today&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;$1000 investment in S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,210 today&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;$1000 investment in S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $950 today&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Taken together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom bottom &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;bottom&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; line for a similar approach with the S&amp;amp;amp;P: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;After five $1,000 investments into an S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 my portfolio would be worth $7,080.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That is up &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;+42%&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/&quot;&amp;gt;since January 2018&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; compared to a &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;+224%&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here’s a fancy new chart showing the four year ROI comparison between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&amp;amp;amp;P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/oyo0c99q6ji81.png?width=575&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=f426556b1975b3e706e89121b37b083f1295d007&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/oyo0c99q6ji81.png?width=575&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=f426556b1975b3e706e89121b37b083f1295d007&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Conclusion:&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Many thanks to the long-time Experiment followers, appreciate you taking the time to follow along over the years.  For those just getting into crypto, welcome! I hope these reports can somehow give you a taste of what you may be in for as you begin your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, think long term, don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose, and try to enjoy the ride! Feel free to reach out with any questions and stay tuned for monthly progress reports. Keep an eye out for my parallel projects where I repeat the experiment, purchasing another $1000 ($100 each) of new sets of Top Ten cryptos as of &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-36&quot;&amp;gt;January 1st, 2019&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-24&quot;&amp;gt;January 1st, 2020&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-12&quot;&amp;gt;January 1st, 2021&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, and most recently, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2022/&quot;&amp;gt;January 1st, 2022&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The average person still doesn&amp;amp;#39;t understand that they are losing money every year that inflation is above whatever pathetic amount of a raise that they received. They just see bigger number = more money and have no idea what purchasing power is. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The average person still thinks that they should turn down a raise if it moves them into a higher tax bracket because they think they will pay more overall than they gain and don&amp;amp;#39;t realise that the higher tax bracket is only in effect for the money earnt ABOVE that threshold not all their money.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now this doesn&amp;amp;#39;t mean the average person cannot be involved with crypto just like they can use stocks, shares and the traditional financial system. What it does mean is that they need to trust crypto not understand it and use it in more of a blind faith way like they do everything else.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The most I knew was that crypto is a payment system that is kind of anti government (decentralized).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Over that one year I went from dumb to well still dumb but knowledge about crypto person. As there are not many who know much about crypto yet just as I one year ago, I&amp;amp;#39;m finally good at something.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You will gather a lot of knowledge about crypto in just a very small time, eventhough it&amp;amp;#39;s pretty complex all you will want to do it as it either actually interests you or you just think it should interest you.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With time going the knowledge is going to expand and you will know what crypto is about. And if you support that idea you won&amp;amp;#39;t care about short term prices anymore. The only thing you would want is that crypto becomes even more successful, more known. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So it&amp;amp;#39;s all going shift from money to knowledge, from short term to long term.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here is the seed phrase that showed up in the commercial&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/ulrafaik5gi81.png?width=293&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=33bb6d8393876f4396a8d31a5acef7aa67eef969&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/ulrafaik5gi81.png?width=293&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=33bb6d8393876f4396a8d31a5acef7aa67eef969&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Of those 12 words 3 of them don&amp;amp;#39;t exist in bitcoin&amp;amp;#39;s bip-039 list of 2048 words found &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/english.txt&quot;&amp;gt;here&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The most prominently displayed words I could narrow down during the commercial that existed in the 2048 words were&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;1) Street: graffiti on the wall &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/Sk_52aI_W1M?t=11&quot;&amp;gt;0:11&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;2) Sport: the S was specifically cut off on the poster where it appeared most prominently &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/Sk_52aI_W1M?t=14&quot;&amp;gt;0:14&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;3) Fortune: from the fortune favors the brave outro &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/Sk_52aI_W1M?t=25&quot;&amp;gt;0:25&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My worksheet&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/6c909s947gi81.png?width=421&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=63304a804f6eebed2d838cf35716c2587a0b9ba6&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/6c909s947gi81.png?width=421&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=63304a804f6eebed2d838cf35716c2587a0b9ba6&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I went to  &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.myetherwallet.com/wallet/access/software?type=mnemonic&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.myetherwallet.com/wallet/access/software?type=mnemonic&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; to test out phrases and opened the wallet. The last combination was the 3 word replacement. sport, street, fortune.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/7x0oajsu7gi81.png?width=293&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e608314fa7fc0daf3729f11c3f297e09497b514e&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/7x0oajsu7gi81.png?width=293&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e608314fa7fc0daf3729f11c3f297e09497b514e&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The wallet is empty and I presume dead. Nothing has ever gone in or out of it. But just for fun now everyone here has access to it and maybe one of us wins something cool if CDC ever deposits something there. First come first serve. Safe travels fellow internet dwellers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So while USDT still has a larger market cap than USDC, it won’t stay like that for long (most probably end of this year if USDC maintains this pace of growth)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The prospect of USDC flipping USDT as the major stablecoin currency in the crypto market is one of the most important.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It would mark the slow but imminent decline and eventual downfall of Tether, the largest scam in the crypto market that still operates despite all the shady shit it does.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This might also make way for more stablecoins with actual backing and auditing like UST, EURST and BUSD to overlap USDT pretty soon.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/k12wnd/moon_proposal_double_comment_karma/&quot;&amp;gt;CCIP-001&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; was a governance poll that passed over a year ago and resulted in doubling the karma earned by comments relative to posts. However a consequence of this poll is that comments with negative karma also receive the 2x multiplier.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For example, currently a comment that gets downvoted to -3 karma would count as -6 towards the Moons distribution.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This was likely not the intended effect and users already often express hesitance to voice controversial opinions due to fear of being downvoted. Having this multiplier for negative karma only adds to this issue.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Solution:&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This proposal would prevent comments with negative Karma at the time of the snapshot from getting the 2x multiplier.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Mathematically this could be calculated as:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;final_comment_karma = Max(comment_karma, 2*comment_karma)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To be clear, this proposal doesn&amp;amp;#39;t change the impact of downvotes on comments that have positive karma. For instance, a comment with 10 karma that gets downvoted to 9 would end up with 18 karma instead of 20 (as intended, so that last downvote still &amp;amp;quot;counts 2x&amp;amp;quot;). The proposal is only for comments that &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;end up&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; with negative karma.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Examples (if proposal passes):&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A comment that gets -3 karma would count as -3 towards the Moons distribution&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A comment that gets +3 karma would &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;still&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; count as +6 towards the Moons distribution&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Pros/Cons&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Pro: Controversial opinions will be less penalized in comments&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Pro: Mass-downvote actions will be less impactful&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Con: Rewards for comment karma might be too high already&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Con: Some comments with negative karma are low-quality and deserve 2x multiplier&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;
