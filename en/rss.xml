Being the &amp;amp;#39;crypto guy&amp;amp;#39; is a good way to become the loser or the annoying guy in the group.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I don&amp;amp;#39;t know what it is about crypto that makes people who devote their whole persona and personality to it such annoying douchebags. It&amp;amp;#39;s much more prominent with NFT guys online, but it&amp;amp;#39;s true for crypto as well. It just gives you a bad name, and I don&amp;amp;#39;t think being the crypto guy is conductive to anything good in social situations. It just makes you look like a loser, and more often than not you are one if you make crypto your whole personality.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Just my two cents. Some people could really stand to calm down a bit with crypto as their personality.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Price Analysis:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The price fluctuates with the DeFi market, outperforming the Defi Index (&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;DEFIPERP, FTX&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;) significantly during from Jan 2020 to Nov 2021.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The price significantly rose after rumors of a GME partnership, however, this has not yet materialized resulting in the price to underperform the Defi Index and underperformon positive news around fundamentals (i.e. wallet release, large amount of traded volume, etc…)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The below graph outlines some news articles and previous project milestones (note: this is nowhere near exhaustive):&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/xr09fpvgqmo81.png?width=2642&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=272f233de91423f101887e54d8b2d653a31c3f06&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/xr09fpvgqmo81.png?width=2642&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=272f233de91423f101887e54d8b2d653a31c3f06&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Runway:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Two funding rounds (2017 &amp;amp;amp; 2018) raised 45 Million from a total of 10 investors. No post-ICO funding has been provided.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;As per the vesting schedule tokens are locked for two years after ICO (were locked until Aug 2019) and then were released monthly over a two month period (i.e. until Aug 2021). Note that allocation to investors had no lockup.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Ongoing Development:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Although there is no clear roadmap with definitive dates for 2022 the following development items are highlighted for a 2022 release:

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Continuing to invest resource into the NFT space including Counterfactual NFT&amp;amp;#39;s&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Loopring HQ releasing in Decentraland&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;More direct bridges to LRC (easier to move funds in and out)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Multi-layered wallet&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Loopring DAO&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Loopring/&quot;&amp;gt;https://github.com/Loopring/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; is active&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Developers are active&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Community:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Google trends for &amp;amp;quot;Loopring&amp;amp;quot; worldwide over the last 12 months is showing steadily decreased interest since the GME partnership rumor&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/ks1uf1gzqmo81.png?width=2583&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=a6d7bc145c0889c980278598658755f5f2bba8d7&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/ks1uf1gzqmo81.png?width=2583&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=a6d7bc145c0889c980278598658755f5f2bba8d7&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Loopring has an active community:

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Discord: &amp;amp;gt;20,000 Members [exact number not stated]&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Reddit: 98.2K Members&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Twitter: 186.5 K Followers&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Large proportion of the community was brought in during the GME rumor and this is reflected in the posts and conversaiton&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Tokenomics:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Deflationary programmatic burn with a capped supply.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Max supply is 1.37 Billion and 97% of this is circulating&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Overall (&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;disclaimer: this is my analysis of the above information&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;This is a solid project in relation to L2 solutions.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The transition into the NFT space is in line with the original product  niche (i.e. offering low cost solutions to L1&amp;amp;#39;s)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The GME announcement significantly skewed the crypto price with zero fundamentals backing it up. This in turn overshadowed fundamental improvements to the project in later days.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We all dream that we don&amp;amp;#39;t have to go to work, but that we have enough money for a quality life and the costs of life when you have a family.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you don&amp;amp;#39;t already have a lot of money, if you are not already rich, then how can you live on passive income? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It takes a lot of luck, effort and work to reach a level where a person can say that he no longer has to work and that he can live freely from passive income. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The real question is how to get that passive income.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What exactly is passive income?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Mining is one of the ways of passive income, but even here you have to buy quality equipment, take care of it, be there if needed, if there is a power outage or something like that. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you get crazy rich by trading cryptocurrencies, then you can stake that crypto, but only if you succeed in that, and that is not easy.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This indicates that the overall momentum of the NFT market is weakening, and supply is catching up to dropping demand. We&amp;amp;#39;ll see fewer $300k Monkeys JPEGs, and things will begin to slow down now that it&amp;amp;#39;s becoming more difficult to flip the NFTs for a bigger sucker to buy in.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/pq40q2hx0jo81.png?width=1200&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=91d2f420af8a7057419bd78717dfa5a58bf414c2&quot;&amp;gt;Image is selfexplanatory&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So, what does this mean for ordinary crypto enthusiasts like myself and you?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The altcoin season is approaching. Not to note that, despite the fact that their NFT barrier of entry is decreasing, gaming tokens are anticipated to surge.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

We’re already seeing things like crypto credit cards from platforms like Binance, Coinbase and CoinOvy gaining a lot of popularity in the mainstream market.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;People BTC is here to stay. Don&amp;amp;#39;t panic. Don&amp;amp;#39;t give up. And when things look bleak, and they will, remember last five or six months and tell newbies about it.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you have the knowledge to buy the right coin and the patience not to panic, you will be rewarded.

Every time I read it, I end up crying. Hal was paralyzed by this time and he was typing this message using an eye-tracking device.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“I thought I&amp;amp;#39;d write about the last four years, an eventful time for Bitcoin and me.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For those who don&amp;amp;#39;t know me, I&amp;amp;#39;m Hal Finney. I got my start in crypto working on an early version of PGP, working closely with Phil Zimmermann. When Phil decided to start PGP Corporation, I was one of the first hires. I would work on PGP until my retirement. At the same time, I got involved with the Cypherpunks. I ran the first cryptographically based anonymous remailer, among other activities.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fast forward to late 2008 and the announcement of Bitcoin. I&amp;amp;#39;ve noticed that cryptographic graybeards (I was in my mid 50&amp;amp;#39;s) tend to get cynical. I was more idealistic; I have always loved crypto, the mystery and the paradox of it.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When Satoshi announced Bitcoin on the cryptography mailing list, he got a skeptical reception at best. Cryptographers have seen too many grand schemes by clueless noobs. They tend to have a knee jerk reaction.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I was more positive. I had long been interested in cryptographic payment schemes. Plus I was lucky enough to meet and extensively correspond with both Wei Dai and Nick Szabo, generally acknowledged to have created ideas that would be realized with Bitcoin. I had made an attempt to create my own proof of work based currency, called RPOW. So I found Bitcoin facinating.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When Satoshi announced the first release of the software, I grabbed it right away. I think I was the first person besides Satoshi to run bitcoin. I mined block 70-something, and I was the recipient of the first bitcoin transaction, when Satoshi sent ten coins to me as a test. I carried on an email conversation with Satoshi over the next few days, mostly me reporting bugs and him fixing them.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Today, Satoshi&amp;amp;#39;s true identity has become a mystery. But at the time, I thought I was dealing with a young man of Japanese ancestry who was very smart and sincere. I&amp;amp;#39;ve had the good fortune to know many brilliant people over the course of my life, so I recognize the signs.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After a few days, bitcoin was running pretty stably, so I left it running. Those were the days when difficulty was 1, and you could find blocks with a CPU, not even a GPU. I mined several blocks over the next days. But I turned it off because it made my computer run hot, and the fan noise bothered me. In retrospect, I wish I had kept it up longer, but on the other hand I was extraordinarily lucky to be there at the beginning. It&amp;amp;#39;s one of those glass half full half empty things.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The next I heard of Bitcoin was late 2010, when I was surprised to find that it was not only still going, bitcoins actually had monetary value. I dusted off my old wallet, and was relieved to discover that my bitcoins were still there. As the price climbed up to real money, I transferred the coins into an offline wallet, where hopefully they&amp;amp;#39;ll be worth something to my heirs.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Speaking of heirs, I got a surprise in 2009, when I was suddenly diagnosed with a fatal disease. I was in the best shape of my life at the start of that year, I&amp;amp;#39;d lost a lot of weight and taken up distance running. I&amp;amp;#39;d run several half marathons, and I was starting to train for a full marathon. I worked my way up to 20+ mile runs, and I thought I was all set. That&amp;amp;#39;s when everything went wrong.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My body began to fail. I slurred my speech, lost strength in my hands, and my legs were slow to recover. In August, 2009, I was given the diagnosis of ALS, also called Lou Gehrig&amp;amp;#39;s disease, after the famous baseball player who got it.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;ALS is a disease that kills moter neurons, which carry signals from the brain to the muscles. It causes first weakness, then gradually increasing paralysis. It is usually fatal in 2 to 5 years. My symptoms were mild at first and I continued to work, but fatigue and voice problems forced me to retire in early 2011. Since then the disease has continued its inexorable progression.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Today, I am essentially paralyzed. I am fed through a tube, and my breathing is assisted through another tube. I operate the computer using a commercial eyetracker system. It also has a speech synthesizer, so this is my voice now. I spend all day in my power wheelchair. I worked up an interface using an arduino so that I can adjust my wheelchair&amp;amp;#39;s position using my eyes.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It has been an adjustment, but my life is not too bad. I can still read, listen to music, and watch TV and movies. I recently discovered that I can even write code. It&amp;amp;#39;s very slow, probably 50 times slower than I was before. But I still love programming and it gives me goals. Currently I&amp;amp;#39;m working on something Mike Hearn suggested, using the security features of modern processors, designed to support &amp;amp;quot;Trusted Computing&amp;amp;quot;, to harden Bitcoin wallets. It&amp;amp;#39;s almost ready to release. I just have to do the documentation.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And of course the price gyrations of bitcoins are entertaining to me. I have skin in the game. But I came by my bitcoins through luck, with little credit to me. I lived through the crash of 2011. So I&amp;amp;#39;ve seen it before. Easy come, easy go.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That&amp;amp;#39;s my story. I&amp;amp;#39;m pretty lucky overall. Even with the ALS, my life is very satisfying. But my life expectancy is limited. Those discussions about inheriting your bitcoins are of more than academic interest. My bitcoins are stored in our safe deposit box, and my son and daughter are tech savvy. I think they&amp;amp;#39;re safe enough. I&amp;amp;#39;m comfortable with my legacy.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Ape coin is trending all over the place, so now would be a good time to look at the past performance of popular memecoins and see why it&amp;amp;#39;s a bad idea to ape into Apecoin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Technical Analysis&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;But that dogecoin guy became a millionaire by investing his life savings in cute doggo token&amp;amp;quot;. Well here&amp;amp;#39;s a chart for Dogecoin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/1mrvbri4ldo81.png?width=1020&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=0e3b93bea732d7693b0f879eb7a82ad0d74d4618&quot;&amp;gt;DOGE/BTC Chart | Binance | Heikin Ashi&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;No surprises here. Dogecoin has been bleeding against Bitcoin for almost a year now. That means, investors who bought doge, took an &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;incredibly&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; higher risk(than btc investors) and got &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;worse&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; returns. I can&amp;amp;#39;t think of any financial asset with worse risk-adjusted-returns. In short, if you&amp;amp;#39;re investing in altcoins, you would want your alt to perform as well as BTC or better since they are inherently riskier.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here&amp;amp;#39;s a similar story for Shiba Inu:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/vk43wo69ndo81.png?width=1180&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=cdd403bf08f3138d87b8d1bfa75a9865f3d6cbba&quot;&amp;gt;SHIB/BTC Chart | Binance | Heikin Ashi&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As seen in the previous chart, we can see an initial few days of hype, and then a continuous bleed against BTC.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Fundamental Analysis&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Timing&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now is probably the worst time to invest in highly speculative assets. The terrible Russia-Ukraine war is happening, and the global economy and supply chains are heavily affected due to that.  Taking an excessive amount of financial risk at this moment is the last thing you&amp;amp;#39;d want to do.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Lastly, if you&amp;amp;#39;re playing the short term game, you have already lost. Like all financial markets, crypto will transfer wealth from the impatient to the patient investor.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TLDR: Don&amp;amp;#39;t buy ApeCoin or any meme-coins. You&amp;amp;#39;re likely going to regret it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Apparently the new &amp;amp;#39;Spending Power&amp;amp;#39; feature let&amp;amp;#39;s you take a crypto loan using your staked coins as collateral... with 0% interest if that loan is repaid within 7 days. This seems like a fairly original idea as you continue to earn interest on any coins in Earn while being allowed to use those same coins as collateral for the &amp;amp;#39;Spending Power&amp;amp;#39; loan. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;From what I&amp;amp;#39;ve read, this new feature is already rolling out in Canada and the borrow limit is tied to card tier.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;More importantly, this is a super convenient way to top up your CDC card immediately while waiting for fiat to be credited from your bank account to the CDC Fiat Wallet (and free due to that 7-day 0% interest period). &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Loans which are not repaid within 7 days then accrue interest at 9.99%.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As someone who was massively critical when CDC decreased the Earn Limit recently, that does now start to make a little more sense. More importantly, this will hopefully inspire other lenders (Nexo, etc) to start offering similar interest free loans.... &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m a guy and I&amp;amp;#39;ve been speaking with a girl from another country for about 3 months now. I would say its more than a friendship. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyway, very early on in our conversations she brought up crypto mining and said that I should do it, and she would show me how.
I did some research and thought there&amp;amp;#39;s no way I can crypto mine, 1: I&amp;amp;#39;m not clever enough and 2: I haven&amp;amp;#39;t even got a computer,  let alone super computer power. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;She then got me to download a digital wallet app and another app where I will transfer my crypto too. We are &amp;amp;#39;mining&amp;amp;#39; USTD, which is a stable coin. 
However,  I&amp;amp;#39;m sure it&amp;amp;#39;s not crypto mining, she&amp;amp;#39;s basically give me a hyperlink to use on the DApps (Decentralized apps) which takes me through to a mining pool where I can claim anywhere from 1-6% interest daily (depending on my wallet balance) &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So I started off putting 100 USDT to see if it would work,  and it sure did. I was receiving 1.5% everyday, but that&amp;amp;#39;s hardly nothing. After 3 weeks I put 1000 USDT in and was reaping a 3% interest everyday. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fast forward a couple months,  obviously I have been speaking to this girl everyday and the trust levels are building. Last week, I deposited another 8300 USDT to boost it to 10,000. That way i get 3.5% of that everyday. She tells me she has over 100,000 deposited which means she gets 4.5% daily,  she makes 4500 USDT in one day... &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;ve made 2,300 USTD in the last 6 days, since I increased my balance to 10,000. But it all seems way too good to be true?? Surely no one can make this much money a day, for literally doing nothing. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This girl I&amp;amp;#39;m speaking to now wants me to deposit even more to take advantage of even higher interest rates,  and it&amp;amp;#39;s making me suspicious. Could she literally take my money through the 3rd party DApp? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;ve already deposited money to my bank twice before and have been successful, so withdrawing the cash isn&amp;amp;#39;t an issue. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I done some research on &amp;amp;#39;Coin Staking&amp;amp;#39; and this sounds a lot similar to what I&amp;amp;#39;m actually doing.  With coin staking, your essentially donating your crypto assets to contribute to the blockchain, and you get rewarded each time a transaction gets validated. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m really hoping someone can help shed some light on what I&amp;amp;#39;m actually involved in. I&amp;amp;#39;m happy to answer any questions. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thanks so much!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I only have relevant holdings of four coins: BTC, ETH, another top coin that this sub likes a lot and one pretty small coin that also used to be popular around here, as my high-risk option. I don&amp;amp;#39;t mention the other two explicitly because this is not a shill post, the message is: I have a portfolio this sub would pretty much approve of, I don&amp;amp;#39;t have any meme coins or hyped moonshots, not even in my smaller, insignificant holdings.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That&amp;amp;#39;s because I don&amp;amp;#39;t really like meme coins. Don&amp;amp;#39;t really see the appeal, except from trying to get lucky and make money quick. But I dislike misinformation even more, and I see problems about that on this sub. If someone made a post right now where they said&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;ICP founder confirms: &amp;amp;quot;It was a planned rug pull from the beginning!&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;and completely made up a story, it would get hundreds, maybe thousands of upvotes. Maybe the mods would remove it at some point, maybe not. But people would eat it up. If I then came along and made another post that elaborately showed how that post just completely lied, it would get buried in downvotes and only a few people would read it. I could start with a disclaimer that I don&amp;amp;#39;t think ICP is a good project and that I don&amp;amp;#39;t hold any and never did, people would still call me an ICP shill that is bitter because he gambled on the wrong coin and is now trying to pump his bags.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How do I know that? &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Because it happened to me multiple times.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; I really dislike misinformation and the unfounded circle-jerk-hating that&amp;amp;#39;s going on here. So quite a few of the posts I make are just trying to correct false information that got really popular on here, I feel like half my posts start with &amp;amp;quot;No, &amp;amp;quot;. If this misinformation I am trying to correct is about the coins this sub hates, however, this usually doesn&amp;amp;#39;t go so well. Two examples:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A few months ago, I made a post saying that it was a bad argument to say Doge is dead just because it&amp;amp;#39;s down from ATH (back then, there were multiple very popular post saying just that), when almost everything was down from ATH. I did not say a positive word about Doge, just that &amp;amp;quot;being down from ATH&amp;amp;quot; is a bad argument, especially for a coin that has been surviving for 8 years. I was called a shill, people told me I fell for a get rich quick scheme (&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;remember, I never had any Doge and also said that in the post&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;) etc.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Similarly, today I made a post that &amp;amp;quot;ApeCoin fell 80% on its first day&amp;amp;quot; is just as misleading as &amp;amp;quot;ApeCoin increased 2,700% on its first day&amp;amp;quot; and pretty much just lying. In the post I said that I was not interested at all in the coin, that it might be a scam but is most likely just a pretty bad coin. But well, that specific popular &amp;amp;quot;criticism&amp;amp;quot; on here was not valid as everyone that didn&amp;amp;#39;t buy in the first two minutes after launch (i.e. some bots) currently made a profit. You guessed it: I&amp;amp;#39;m a shill, I&amp;amp;#39;m defending a scam, I fell for a scam (&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;remember: I did not&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It happened more often than this, usually in comments. And I am more annoyed about it than I should be. This mindset is just weird: &amp;amp;#39;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;I don&amp;amp;#39;t like this coin, so I will just upvote negative posts about it and don&amp;amp;#39;t care if they say the truth or not. If someone corrects these lies, they are shills&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#39;. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Why this friend-or-enemy mentality? Why can people in crypto not accept that maybe, while their favorite coins are &amp;amp;#39;good&amp;amp;#39; on average, they have flaws and pointing them out is not FUD or makes someone a hater? And that the coins they hate might be &amp;amp;#39;bad&amp;amp;#39; on average, but not everything about them is, and that correcting misinformation about them is not shilling?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;amp;quot;I think coin X is bad, but this one aspect about it is just not true&amp;amp;quot; would be an awful shill. Who would buy a coin because of that?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;tl;dr: shades of grey exist, not everything is black and white. If someone doesn&amp;amp;#39;t join in some circle-jerk-hating, that doesn&amp;amp;#39;t make them a shill. If someone thinks not everything about a coin is perfect, that doesn&amp;amp;#39;t make them a hater.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
