As I type this, the current price is $42,948.  But this post isn&amp;amp;#39;t about the price.  It&amp;amp;#39;s about where we are and where we&amp;amp;#39;re headed, in terms of the 4 year halving-to-halving cycle.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;We&amp;amp;#39;re almost halfway to the next Halving.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You probably know what the halving is.  Let&amp;amp;#39;s talk about the effect the halving has.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Every ten minutes, a miner wins a block reward, and that&amp;amp;#39;s a big deal because block rewards are the only way new Bitcoin is created.  Right now, the block reward is 6.25 BTC.  Thus, every ten minutes, 6.25 BTC is created and awarded to a miner.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In May 2024, the block reward will be cut in half, to 3.125 BTC.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That doesn&amp;amp;#39;t sound like a big change unless you&amp;amp;#39;re a miner, but add up the block rewards over time and you&amp;amp;#39;ll see how much of a difference the halving makes on the supply of newly mined coins hitting the market:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;6.25 BTC are mined every ten minutes (roughly).  This is the current block reward.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;6.25 X 6 = 37.5 BTC are mined every hour.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;37.5 X 24 = 900 BTC are mined every day.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;900 X 30 = 27,000 BTC are mined every month.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;27,000 X 4 = 108,000 BTC are mined every four months.  I use four months as a reference point here because it takes around four months for the halving to cause an imbalance of supply and demand, better known as a supply shock.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The Supply Shock Of 2024:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In May 2024, the halving will cut the block reward in half, from 6.25 BTC down to 3.125 BTC.  Price is where supply meets demand, and the halving cuts the supply of new coins in half.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;By the beginning of fall, 2024, instead of having 108,000 BTC added to the supply since May, only 54,000 will have been added (because The Halving cut the block reward in half).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That decrease is what causes a supply shock.  The supply drops, which means there won&amp;amp;#39;t be enough supply to meet the demand, which means the price will keep rising until demand drops enough to put supply and demand in balance again.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here&amp;amp;#39;s an easy way to understand a supply shock:  Imagine that you have to attend a huge meeting every morning for a week.  Luckily, they provide enough coffee for everybody.  But one day, there&amp;amp;#39;s only half as much coffee.  The supply of coffee was cut in half but the demand is still the same, so there&amp;amp;#39;s not enough.  People are getting pissed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the marketplace, price is set by demand.  When the supply of BTC being sold goes down, the price keeps going up until there isn&amp;amp;#39;t enough demand to buy it at a higher price.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Price is where supply meets demand:  how much is being sold and how much are buyers willing to pay.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But we all know it isn&amp;amp;#39;t that simple in reality.  In 2024, miners will start hoarding coins instead of selling them, because they anticipate higher prices.  This will make the supply shock worse because it will drop the supply of coins being sold even lower.  And rising prices causes hype, which will drive demand even higher, which will push prices even higher.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;But It Ain&amp;amp;#39;t 2024 Yet!&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A typical halving-to-halving four year cycle looks like this:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Halving, followed by around 4 months of hoarding, where people hold on to their coins rather than sell them, anticipating higher prices.  This is followed by a bull run of around a year and a crash that goes on for a few months, which is followed by a roughly 2 year period of readjustment that lasts until the next halving.  I think we&amp;amp;#39;re somewhere between the crash and readjustment phase now.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Maybe we&amp;amp;#39;ll see a crash, maybe we won&amp;amp;#39;t.  Institutional money may have disrupted the usual post-bull-run crash, or at least lessened it.  Or not.  Only time will tell.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s easy to feel despair as the price of Bitcoin drops, but I view this as an opportunity.  I think you should too.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Just as the last 4 year cycle was the last chance to buy at 4 digit prices, this 4 year cycle may be the last chance to buy at 5 digit prices.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is the time to accumulate.  Buy while you can and hold, because 2024 will be here before you know it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Secure your coins, preferably in a hardware wallet.  Make sure your seed phrase is secured for the long haul.  Have a plan in place for passing on your coins if you die...  just in case.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;P.S.:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If declining prices are causing you anguish, walk away for a while.  Don&amp;amp;#39;t sell, but DO stop checking the price and reading forums and the news if doing so causes you more pain than pleasure.  Take care of your mental health.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;KEEP CALM&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
AND&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
HODL ON&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Volatility scares people, and we all have to respect that. It will take time for people to come around and &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/b/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-import-big-data-animation-abstract-rainbow-spot-light-background-223802827.jpg&quot;&amp;gt;see this space for all that it holds&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;; from opportunistic cash grabs to apex dollar hedges, from over leveraged scams to the true start of DAOs that one-day might replace Apple.        &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Nuance is key! Consistency requires you to be as ignorant today as you were a year ago (historian Bernard Berenson said that). Are you still the same hodler you were a year ago?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Making sure everything I did was safe and calculated and non stressful. Just meander through and die. Such is life and what can you do about it. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then enter crypto. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I’m 29 and have been semi successful. I’ve always been happy with where I was and never super stressed out about anything. Get the 8-5 M-F job. Log off at 5 every day. Go to the gym. Play some videogames. Got married. Was happy. Figured everything would work out as long as I played by the system. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But man has crypto lit a fire under my ass. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I’ve never been super on top of money. Spent it wisely, got a house early. Been ok with it. But after crypto I researched everything constantly. I consolidated old 401ks. Opened an IRA, maxed out my current 401k match. Sold my house because I had a place to be rent free for as long as I needed for a new house and it wasn’t the best neighborhood to be in. Made a nice return on proceeds. Was able to have a dream wedding from it. Invested a good amount of safe money into crypto. Got a crypto.com card for rewards. Got another simple credit card. Boosted my credit from 680 to 720. Did much better at work since I had new motivation and got raises and promotions from. Love working OT because thats more money to have and invest. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Is my portfolio in the red? Again, yes lol. But I don’t care. Playing the long game and getting all my other finances in order has been part of the journey. Couldn’t be happier with where I am at in life now.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

But it got me thinking: if you &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;could&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; never sell your crypto for fiat, would people still buy it?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;This is a thought experiment.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; In this scenario, you couldn&amp;amp;#39;t exchange crypto for fiat, ever - but it&amp;amp;#39;s not just that exchanges wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t offer it, there would be no loophole (&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;edit: so also no crypto credit/debit cards&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;) for it. You, for some reason, could not find someone to privately sell your coin to for fiat. In this hypothetical world, everything would be the same as now - you could buy crypto with fiat, you could use crypto for their use cases, and you could even use crypto to buy stuff in the few places that enable it - but you could not get fiat for it. This means, you would either have to have a use case for crypto that isn&amp;amp;#39;t &amp;amp;quot;getting more money&amp;amp;quot;, or you would have to speculate on more adoption and more merchants accepting crypto in the future.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Would you still invest in crypto? I&amp;amp;#39;ll be honest: I&amp;amp;#39;m in this to make more fiat, if I couldn&amp;amp;#39;t exhange crypto for fiat I would not invest. What about you?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If banks really want to be in control of our money, they better be ready to pay for it, or we move our money to Crypto (or literally anywhere else). This basically a scam on older people who are not aware where to store their money elsewhere.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Words (insert eg x% )that was used years ago as the go to for panic posts- &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Since we are seeing a bit of volatility today and I’m starting to see panic posts some words from veterans here from years ago to keep the chin up and HODL strong. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The market tend to have a bullwhip effect vs normal stock market nowadays so any move is exponentially larger. Part of the risk and excitement of being in the crypt. If you haven’t been here long (most people here have got into the crypt the last 4 months) this is part of the game and likely will be for a time. This is good as this also gives the gainz over time more than traditional markets. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The market is more mature than years gone by but the volatility is still there albeit less pronounced eg 80% drop in 2hrs - keep it simple (dont over trade)and HODL in what you believe in and may the gwei be with you….&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;PS this is something that has been part of crypto since the early days that hardens one to a new level of apathy and diamond hands the real test comes in when suicide lines come in at the post 30% drops to 80% drops. Again only have skin in the game in what you believe and make sure it’s quality bags!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitcoin crashed to 28k but climbed back up to 69K, isn&amp;amp;#39;t that a proof that it always does? There have been so many crashes like this one and it will pass and everyone will forget about it. Not only that but Bitcoin will break its ATH again this year, that much is obvious.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The reason you&amp;amp;#39;re down is not because your coin failed, the whole market failed so why sell if you believe in it? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So if you&amp;amp;#39;re thinking about selling, especially at a loss, I&amp;amp;#39;d advise you to be patient and hold as there&amp;amp;#39;s no point to it and you&amp;amp;#39;ll only lose money.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To have full functionality (social recovery, L1 funds etc) you’ll need to activate the L1 wallet which will of course incur a gas fee so be cautious of the current Eth gas fee. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The main draw of the L2 Wallet atm is access to DEX/AMM on L2 w/very cheap transfer fees. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Apparently the Android free L2 Wallet deploy will come soon, I assume in the next day as they can push it to Android basically any time whereas iOS has to get approved.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So, you&amp;amp;#39;re interested in cryptocurrencies, and you&amp;amp;#39;ve heard about those so-called &amp;amp;quot;zero-knowledge proofs&amp;amp;quot; (ZK) used by projects such as Loopring, zkSync and StarkWare.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now you&amp;amp;#39;re wondering : what are zero-knowledge proofs and why are they so important? Good news, champ, I am here for you!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Let&amp;amp;#39;s say I found a cave with two distinct entrances, Left and Right. The two entrances are connected by a corridor, but a dragon prevents anyone from passing through the corridor. To make the dragon let you through, you need a magic stone. I have this magic stone, and I want to prove to you that I have it, but I don&amp;amp;#39;t want to show it to you, and I don&amp;amp;#39;t want to tell my secret to anyone but you.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is how it works. You close your eyes while I enter the cave, without telling you if I chose the Left or Right entrance. You open your eyes again, then ask me to come out on a particular side and I do so. You close your eyes, I go back into the cave, and we repeat the experience 100 times.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If I have the magic stone, the dragon will let me through everytime and I can leave the cave through the entrance you tell me, 100 times out of 100. But if I don&amp;amp;#39;t have the stone, every other time I won&amp;amp;#39;t be able to get out through the chosen entrance - statistically, I will only have the good answer 50% of the time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;So by using this method, I will prove to you that I have the magic stone, without ever showing it to you&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. Moreover, you will not be able to prove to anyone else that I have the stone, since an outside observer could always think that we have arranged it together in advance.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is what is called a zero-knowledge proof. In cryptocurrencies, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;the magic stone is the private key&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. Zero-knowledge proofs are used to show to a validator that you are indeed in possession of the private key, without revealing said private keys to the validator, and without letting the rest of the world know you have the key.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thank you for listening to my story. I hope you had fun today, my little friends!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I had my last BTC (sats, really) purchases sitting in my exchange and wanted to move them to my (software) wallet that I use on my phone. So I copied/pasted it the address on a secure notepad app that syncs with PC, then checked that the address shown on my PC matched the wallet address. It did, so that&amp;amp;#39;s cool.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So on the PC I copied/pasted it on the address box for the withdrawal at my exchange, it was shown as a valid address and I proceeded with the transaction. WRONG!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I sat there waiting for my funds to appear on my wallet but they never did. Transaction was shown as completed on the exchange and then I got alarmed. Started to write an email to my exchange&amp;amp;#39;s support team and then it clicked.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I wanted to say that the destination address was &amp;amp;#39;X&amp;amp;#39; but somehow it was being shown as &amp;amp;#39;Y&amp;amp;#39; on the transaction history. But every time I tried to paste my address it was changing right before my eyes. So my email was looking like &amp;amp;lt;&amp;amp;lt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;This is mi destination address: &amp;amp;#39;Y&amp;amp;#39; // This is the address shown on the transacion history: &amp;amp;#39;Y&amp;amp;#39;&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;. Now, my notepad app was clearly showing that the adddress I was trying to copy was most definitely not &amp;amp;#39;Y&amp;amp;#39;, so something was up.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyway, at that point I deleted the email, no need to bother some support dude because of something that was looking more and more like a royal fuck up.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And then there it is, there was some malware on my PC that was actively seeking BTC addresses and switching them to something similar but a different address alltoghether from whoever scammer made the damned thing. I clearly fucked up by not realizing that, and now&amp;amp;#39;s too late.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Malwarebytes was quick to find and delete the thing and now the computer&amp;amp;#39;s clean again (just like my exchange account, haha. FUCK.)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Be safe out there and double check or triple check everything when doing a transaction. I didn&amp;amp;#39;t realize  at the time so I&amp;amp;#39;m an idiot, but maybe you won&amp;amp;#39;t have to be.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;---&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TL;DR&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There&amp;amp;#39;s malware out there reading your clipboard to find BTC addresses, and when you try to copy/paste it will paste a similar address from the scammer. I didn&amp;amp;#39;t realize so I&amp;amp;#39;m an idiot, but maybe you won&amp;amp;#39;t have to be.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;---&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;EDIT: Okay, thanks for the awards and all. I read the comments but was lazy to reply to each one individually.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;1- My PC wasn&amp;amp;#39;t as infested as some of you may think, I actually clean installed windows 11 like 3 weeks ago FFS. I will reformat it again on the weekend, no worries there. The fucking antivirus did find the culprit, though. After deleting the files and restarting the PC, clipboard was behaving correctly again (I checked a shit ton of times).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;2- &amp;amp;#39;A secure notepad app that syncs&amp;amp;#39; was just to make it easier to explain. It was Bitwarden, using the note entry options. It&amp;amp;#39;s a password manager so it is indeed secure.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;3- Mac / Linux people... Let&amp;amp;#39;s just not go there, I don&amp;amp;#39;t care about OS master race. Windows is a great fit for what I use it and all other OS have their flaws too.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;4- Hardware wallet option is something that I&amp;amp;#39;m always considering, I just fear loosing it, TBH. 2-stage transactions seems like a good enough compromise to me for the time being.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;5- Software wallet on my phone gets uninstalled after each deposit, because I agree that it&amp;amp;#39;s not a great thing to carry around. Then whenever I want to transfer again I re-download it and use the seed phrase to access my stuff.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;6- Now let&amp;amp;#39;s be clear, I know that evrything&amp;amp;#39;s my fault, here. For what is worth, the address was very similar (first letters were the exact same), and was given as a valid address by the exchange so i trusted it more than I should have, but i did not check the complete string and that&amp;amp;#39;s on me. I&amp;amp;#39;m a bit of a newbie, but not a complete idiot, it&amp;amp;#39;s just that I plain hadn&amp;amp;#39;t heard about this particular scam before (hence why I wrote it to alert any other newbie that could find the info useful).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;7- To the people thinking that this was an ad and I didn&amp;amp;#39;t just lose my money... I wish it was so, I truly truly do. Imagine if those fuckers were paying me, too. Ah... Wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t that be nice? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyway, you can&amp;amp;#39;t trust your clipboard, there&amp;amp;#39;s a lesson learned.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m a few steps back and it kinda sucks, but I&amp;amp;#39;ll go back to stacking sats.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Today marks the anniversary of my first ever crypto transaction! My first purchase was of Ethereum, and since then it has been nothing else but a learning journey.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There were a lot of things I learnt later than what I wished, so here are a few of the things I wish I did earlier when investing in crypto:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Keeping track of transactions&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;: when I first bought crypto, I invested X amount of fiat without keeping track of how much I have put into it. Later, I discovered the portfolio trackers. Some good examples are the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://delta.app/en&quot;&amp;gt;Delta App&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://coinmarketcap.com/&quot;&amp;gt;CoinMarketCap&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; portfolio tool. I rather input the transaction manually after making them, as I don&amp;amp;#39;t really like giving API keys to 3rd parties.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Opening a Vault for Moons&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;: easily the worst mistake I have ever done. I never knew the existence of moons until they, well, mooned. I always use my PC or laptop for Reddit and never seen the Vault menu, and when I found out about I felt so stupid as I was quite active in this sub when I first started. Open your Vault!! It is literally free crypto for your posts - please focus on quality!&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Having Native Wallets&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;: this isn&amp;amp;#39;t a mistake, but more of a &amp;amp;quot;help the ecosystem&amp;amp;quot; kind of thing. What I must recommend though is to keep all your assets away from exchanges. A system failure, hacking attack or just bankruptcy can be the end of your funds, so keep your coins in an external wallet. I started with &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.exodus.com/&quot;&amp;gt;Exodus Wallet&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, as it has the most assets and allows staking for interest rewards. With time, I migrated to native wallets (wallets made for a single network in particular) and around 80% of my assets are secured with a Ledger Nano X (hardware wallet, not hackable!).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Don&amp;amp;#39;t stick to one exchange&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;: not all exchanges have all the coins you will want. Not all exchanges have the same features and most importantly, not all have the same fees. what exchanges do I recommend? I personally use &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://Crypto.com&quot;&amp;gt;Crypto.com&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kraken.com/&quot;&amp;gt;Kraken&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. Of course, each one to their own and geographical restrictions may apply to some exchanges.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Don&amp;amp;#39;t do stupid things that can cause you headaches&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;: what I mean with this is, do not add 5 bank accounts to your fiat withdrawal addresses, don&amp;amp;#39;t deposit fiat from 4 different banks in 3 different countries, 2 credit cards and 4 debit cards. Focus on 1 and 1. One card. One bank account. Work yourself around that and it will help you massively. I have seen so many issues with people with locked accounts due to having to verify details etc. that can just be solved by this. I never had a single issue using &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.revolut.com/&quot;&amp;gt;Revolut&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; as my bank account and the virtual card as my means of payment if i use this. Also, all bank deposits are allowed to exchanges from them (EU Customer). KYC! Just do it. The government knows all about you anyways, so don&amp;amp;#39;t worry. You are happy to give your bank details, name, surname, card number away but not a selfie of yourself? The big exchanges have great privacy and security measures, don&amp;amp;#39;t worry!&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Find Rewards. There are A LOT OF THEM!&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;: Crypto is a baby. A volatile baby, but a baby nonetheless. Everything is new! DeFi projects can offer 100%+ APY by staking your coins, projects with PoS networks offer some really good interest by just hodling their coin and a lot of platforms offer interest in stablecoins and other tokens. Personally, I use one of the VISA Cards that CDC offer. It earns me cashback, free services and lets be honest, looks cool af!&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Lastly but most importantly, ENJOY&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;: Don&amp;amp;#39;t look at the chart every day and worry. Yes I look at my portfolio every day but just to see if it is a good moment to buy or not. I never worry. If you are a day trader, then yes. A hodler, then hodl. You are here for the long run. Enjoy the experience, the learning and the communities (apart from &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/bitcoin&quot;&amp;gt;r/bitcoin&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; - that&amp;amp;#39;s a cult). &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hopefully this helps newbies a bit more, and makes it easier to start up! Have a great year everyone.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When you&amp;amp;#39;re seeing double digit percent gains on your coin, it&amp;amp;#39;s time to make that trade and sell a little bit of the bag. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There&amp;amp;#39;s usually a nice dip afterwards and you&amp;amp;#39;ll be glad you&amp;amp;#39;ve got the powder to burn. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And if there&amp;amp;#39;s not a dip afterwards, you&amp;amp;#39;ve got 85% of your original bag to decide to hold or sell. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Finally, if the coin truly tanks afterwards then, you have some USDC that&amp;amp;#39;s much more tradable than your ElonCumRocket. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s truly a win-win-win&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However, I disagree with that statement. If NFTs were in DnD they would be a lawful neutral force, they are not good or evil they are just a tool and being a transparent and open tool it makes them more easy to keep track of.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If anything NFTs should provide more consumer protection for digital game downloads than the present model of Microsoft being all like &amp;amp;quot;trust me bra, we got this&amp;amp;quot; until one day they just remove the game from the store and leave no public evidence that you ever owned it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However, I also 100% guarantee that game companies are going to use this to further monetise the market for pointless crap cosmetics and strip even more out of a game to sell back to the player later.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But people shouldn&amp;amp;#39;t hate the technology, that&amp;amp;#39;s like hating the internet because game companies use the internet to download microtransactions, it really makes no sense. Hate the companies and hate the people buying their garbage.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I’ve more than tripled what I put in, and do not have a single complaint about it. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Is there anyone else that is completely satisfied with Coinbase? I can’t help but think, looking at all these posts, that a lot of the problems people are running into are user error, but maybe I’m the exception?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;the other day on the train i seen many train carts with AVAX (Avalanche blockchain) ads all over the inside of the train cart in NYC ( you can imagine the excitement i felt lol) , i also seen ads for Upland ( a crypto real estate game)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;this is our chance to really get invested and wait for things to get better. I know there&amp;amp;#39;s a chance the market will collapse in a spectacle of people pulling their hair out and jumping out windows, but with the amount of institutions and big companies getting involved, i doubt it. the amount of users they will bring on to what ever networks they decide to work with will def help the case.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;every time the internet upgrades a good handful of people get rich, and yes alot of people lose money also ( but those are the impatient people or the people who put in too much and end up having to pull out )&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;even look at this video from after skool is all about crypto. ( mainly ether and bitcoin ) but they are a youtube channel that makes videos about mental health and life&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;VIDEO: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGHMyxYSa58&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGHMyxYSa58&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;if they are making videos about it, i know this is def not going anywhere and who ever chooses the best chains to invest in will change their life for the better or worse if you only want hookers and cocaine... your choice and youre money&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;So for the love of MONEY,&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; just DYOR and Invest&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now whether you have a bag of ALGO or not, its good to see what is possible with crypto and can only be seen as a positive for us all.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For those that aren&amp;amp;#39;t aware, the rewards were around 3.5% for the 3 month locked period - that&amp;amp;#39;s 14.75%APR. Again, this is only another positive for us all. Its well above inflation and considerably more than any bank would offer in a standard savings account. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The deadline for the second round of Governance is the 6th January, so if you&amp;amp;#39;re thinking about locking it in until the end of March you&amp;amp;#39;ve got a couple of days left (depending where you are in the world).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I bought about $50 worth of it back then and ended up losing access to wherever it was stored at the time. No big deal, it was my first lesson in this crypto journey, one of many. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After years of not paying much attention to crypto and working on other investments; stocks, real estate, retirement funds, etc. I came back to the space in 2019 with a renewed passion and drive. Stocks had always bored me, I never felt like it was a market I related with, and since I work in digital, crypto makes sense to me. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So I got back into Doge because that&amp;amp;#39;s where I started. And then BTC and then ETH all around the same time in 2019. Then came alts, and with them came tons of research and discovery, buying projects I believe in. The crypto world&amp;amp;#39;s volatility didn&amp;amp;#39;t scare me then, and it doesn&amp;amp;#39;t scare me now because I think it&amp;amp;#39;s the future, and I refuse to sit on fiat that isn&amp;amp;#39;t working for me.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fast forward to this fine new year, and I am so proud to have grown my portfolio to what it is today. To be a woman in this space, understand the fundamentals, and withstand the fear is very empowering. So to all the women out there who are either veterans in the crypto space or newbies, keep going!! It&amp;amp;#39;s an honor to invest alongside all of you! And cheers to the men out there crushing it too!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;EDIT: this is absolutely not an anti-man post! Yeesh! Men rock! This is more about women having confidence to invest, learn, grow and become financially independent. Ultimately being able to build an empire with their crypto loving mate!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

This is an extremely small amount considering that is only 1.28% of the 7.8 Billion people we have on earth. The $2.2 Trillion Crypto market is extremely undervalued. In the future when digital currencies start gaining ground and you count inflation, tens of trillions in market cap are completely feasible.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Remember, market cap doesn&amp;amp;#39;t reflect the amount of money invested in Crypto, it just multiplies the current market price with circulating coins. Just because the market cap is high, does not mean Crypto does not have more room to grow.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Let&amp;amp;#39;s say someone tries to acquire $10 Billion in Bitcoin, exchanges feel the pinch and start raising the prices accordingly, the new raised price for each Bitcoin is going to multiplied by the entire circulating amount and raise the market cap by hundreds of billions, if not more.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A good explanation would be Fiat, according to estimates, all the U.S money in circulation is worth &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;6.6 trillion U.S. dollars.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Yet, the USD market cap exceeds 21 Trillion dollars.  The market cap of all Fiat in the world is over &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://fiatmarketcap.com/&quot;&amp;gt;123 Trillion USD&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. Crypto has huge potential, and a 2.2 Trillion market cap for Crypto is still very undervalued.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;TLDR&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;: Yes, we might not be early compared to people in 2010, but being the first 1% to adopt Crypto is still very early. Crypto still has the untapped potential of the 99%, and in that sense we are indeed early as we have tens, if not hundreds of trillions to go.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;they are fully centralized&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;transparent, every transaction is subject to surveillance.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;transactions are directly taxable.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;endless money printing ie. inflation.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;negative interest rates.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;expiry dates on money (literally you have 3 months to spend your salary or it is gone).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;control over what you can and cannot spend your money on.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;easily restrict where you can spend your money, at what time you can spend your money, or even turn off bankaccounts/people.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Look into social credit systems, how effectively they oppress populations. They are already a reality in parts of China.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;a point system that determines your social status.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;virtue points for stuff the government likes&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;penalty points for stuff the government doesnt like.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;your &amp;amp;quot;citizen privileges&amp;amp;quot; are determined by this point system.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;want access to restaurants? your score needs to be over 100 or your QR doesnt work.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;went to the wrong protest?, talked to a dissident?&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; no traveling for you, no supermarket for you... no school for your kids.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;sucked off the balls of the government? &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; maybe youre allowed to buy better food or even some alcohol this month, sucked hard enough?? maybe your kids get to go to a better school.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now combine CBDC&amp;amp;#39;s and social credit...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;CBDCs are every totalitarians wet dream. An airtight tool for oppression.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The QR code system that they&amp;amp;#39;ve been trying to introduce though the covid pandemic is the perfect trojan horse. (I happen to think that is not a coincidence, but then again I am also a crazy conspiracy theorist.)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I know one thing though:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If CBDC&amp;amp;#39;s ever get widely implemented we will forever be cattle to whoever controls them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
