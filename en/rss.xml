&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I was in profit with a couple of coins and I was telling myself that I should get a few hundreds there, few from other coin  and just keep it in fiat or stablecoin or whatever, just save it for a dip or crash, nothing more, nothing less.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Of course, I always invested using DCA tactics and I will keep doing that, but I thought I should have a certain amount of money for a really big dip or crash and don&amp;amp;#39;t touch it untill it happens.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyway, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;don&amp;amp;#39;t be like me&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, keep some money in case of a drop, crash. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is the time when people are making money, investing and waiting for prices to climb up again.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I decided to try purchase my first NFT yesterday, and holy hell was that confusing. Still is. I used my MetaMask account had $200 worth of ETH on there, tried to bid on something worth .007 eth but noticed I had to change it? Okay did the steps ended up back with Poly??? Or some sort of ‚Äúwrapped ETH‚ÄùAnd now down to $70 due to gas fees.. worse yet I don‚Äôt even have the NFT. 
Just imagine going out to buy a $7 dollar beer only to be charged $130 then only to have the bar tender give it someone else. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I know there must have been steps I did not understand and may have screwed things up a little. But holy hell if we want this to be a thing of everyday use, this shit can‚Äôt be happening.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;EDIT- thank you everyone explaining things to me. Im not trying to shit on anything and I still have full belief in where we are heading. 
I understand now that we are still very early stages and I guess I‚Äôm just used to being late to parties. 
That and ETH is kind of a mess and there‚Äôs more than just OpenSea to purchase NFTs. Genuinely was unaware cardano has their own system for it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I mean what I‚Äôm about to say as genuine advice, not to make fun of anyone, but a lot of people here really need to take a step back and look at the bigger picture. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Every day we have people stressing and speculating over the day-to-day movements of their crypto, panicking over bear markets, asking ‚Äúwhere should I invest this spare $50?!‚Äù in the daily. When in reality, they could see their portfolio do a 2x by working a few solid minimum wage shifts and dumping the paycheck into crypto. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A nice 20% pump on the $100 you invested in your favourite alt-coin which you spent hours researching, still only leaves you with $20 profit. You could probably ask your mom for $20 and she‚Äôd give it to you. It might be a harsh truth, but crypto isn‚Äôt a life-changing opportunity until you‚Äôre working with a decent stack of money, until then, conventional money-making methods are faster and more lucrative (without the potential downside of investing!)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It‚Äôs not what you want to hear, but a couple hundred dollars in the market isn‚Äôt going to make you financially free unless you‚Äôre the crypto-embracing, second coming of Warren Buffett. Grinding out a real life job and dumping that money into crypto? That might just do the trick though.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Important disclaimer/reminder:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; I mean ZERO hate to small time investors whatsoever with this post. You guys are learning essential lessons and gaining investing experience without the risk and potential downside of others with more skin in the game, and most importantly, small amounts of money can mean a hell of a lot more to some people than others. I‚Äôm simply saying look at the bigger picture, and make the most of your time. Crypto becomes more rewarding the more you can safely invest into it, typical jobs might not have the potential of crypto, but they will build you a base and give you a start way faster and safer.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And it&amp;amp;#39;s the exact opposite when prices go up. Then they think it&amp;amp;#39;s going to go up every day and forever. We are going to reach 100k in this run. That&amp;amp;#39;s just not how it is, green and red days are mixed up, we won&amp;amp;#39;t straight up shoot to 100k or so. We will suffer for that.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I hear you are scared about that bear everyone is talking about. Will it wake up, will it get eaten by a bull? I don&amp;amp;#39;t know. But while we have nothing else to do, why not take the time to learn something new?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So let&amp;amp;#39;s talk about impermanent loss before nap time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Imagine I have a dragon, and I want to trade it for a unicorn. Both magical creatures are the same price (because they&amp;amp;#39;re magic).&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I go to the toys store, but they don&amp;amp;#39;t want to buy back my dragon. So I need to find someone who is willing to exchange their unicorn for my dragon. I go to the flea market, and I find a merchant with 50 dragons and 50 unicorns in his stand. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;This is the liquidity pool.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The merchant accept to give me a unicorn if I give him my dragon. But as the merchant has to make a living, he charges me a small fee, about 2.5% of the value of the trade, to accept my proposition. I gladly accept to pay the fee, and I go home with my new unicorn.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But now, the merchant has a problem : he has 51 dragons and 49 unicorns. If more and more kids want to trade their dragons for unicorns, the imbalance will grow, and the merchant will eventually run out of unicorns. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The merchant needs an equal amount of dragons and unicorns on it&amp;amp;#39;s stand to make good business.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; So he goes to a friend and offer to sell him 1 dragon for a discount - the dragon is worth $10, so the merchant will sell it for $9.95. The friend accept (because that&amp;amp;#39;s what friends are for), he turns around and sell the dragon at full price, netting a profit of $0.05. He then buys a unicorn on the internet for $10, then goes back to the merchant, and sell it to him for $10.05, netting another profit of $0.05 (this is called &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;arbitrage&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;). The friend has now made $0.10 of profits, the merchant has done $0.15 (the original 2.5% fee he charged me, minus the $0.10 loss from the trades with his friend.) Everybody is happy!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;That $0.10 loss is what is called impermanent loss. It&amp;amp;#39;s the cost of maintaining the balance between dragons and unicorns on the stand.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now, of course, if the merchant didn&amp;amp;#39;t charge me that 2.5% fee, he would be losing money. But he does charge a fee, so he ends up doing profits anyway. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So why are people afraid of impermanent loss? Because if the price of one of the item explodes, and the other item does not, then the losses will be greater. If unicorns are now worth $20, the merchant will incur a greater loss when his friend helps him with the arbitrage. It sucks, and that&amp;amp;#39;s why some people don&amp;amp;#39;t want to be liquidity providers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But here is the thing : &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;fees are almost always more then enough to cover for impermanent loss.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; In our example above, if the price of unicorn doubles and the price of dragons stay the same, impermanent loss will only amount to 5.72%. It doesn&amp;amp;#39;t take much volume for fees to cover this. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There are a few caveats, tho. If you want to provide liquidity for shitcoins, you will absolutely get rekt if/when the shitcoins value goes to zero. That&amp;amp;#39;s why you should provide liquidity only with tokens you are comfortable holding long-term. Another good thing to keep in mind is that it is way less risky to provide liquidity for a pair that includes a stablecoin, because it&amp;amp;#39;s value will go unchanged. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Some ETH/USDC pools were giving a whopping 200% APR for a few hours yesterday.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Even if ETH shot up to a ridiculous price tag of $50 000 USD in six months, you will have made more money then if you simply hold.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Another thing to keep in mind is that &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://dailydefi.org/tools/impermanent-loss-calculator/&quot;&amp;gt;impermanent loss calculators&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; give you the estimate difference between providing liquidity and hold-only... that is, if you were somehow able to perfectly time the bottom and top of the market. As we know it&amp;amp;#39;s impossible to time the market, those calculators really give you an absolute worst-case scenario.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Oh, darn, time flies! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s now nap time, my young friends. Hope you enjoy my story... and I hope you will dream of dragons and unicorns.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fuck no. (maybe) &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A dead cat bounce is a temporary, short-lived recovery of asset prices from a prolonged decline or a¬†bear market¬†that is followed by the continuation of the¬†downtrend.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Check the chart for March 18th, 2020. You can see a dead cat bounce a few days prior to a real crash that we know of.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So my  financial is advice (not a financial advice) is DCA slowly or wait a day or two to see the true heading of this run.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;EDIT: The chart cuts off at 2016...which is apparently making some people think there was a bear market sometime after 2016. Let&amp;amp;#39;s have a look:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/0us34zsk3jd81.png?width=2108&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=79de6ff34018315c748a2e743caef0ca3b277c65&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/0us34zsk3jd81.png?width=2108&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=79de6ff34018315c748a2e743caef0ca3b277c65&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;There was no bear market. There was a relatively small crash in 2020 as everyone panicked over Covid. That&amp;amp;#39;s not a bear market. This picture also shows you that it&amp;amp;#39;s even worse, the market has been absolutely parabolic for almost 2 years.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That&amp;amp;#39;s the S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 index. Notice something? Every ten years or so there&amp;amp;#39;s a severe downward correction which lasts 1-2 years. In the early 2000s it was the tech bubble, in 2008/9 it was the mortgage crisis. As you can see here, we&amp;amp;#39;ve been in a sharp uptrend for over 10 years now. This uptrend has been fueled not in small part by record low interest rates. This is turn has resulted in parts of the market being hopelessly overvalued, a prime example being Tesla.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now look at the crypto charts, specifically the top 50 alts. Most of them have had absolutely face melting pumps over the last 18 months. Do you think that&amp;amp;#39;s just going to keep going up? Their valuations are now so ridiculous that &amp;amp;#39;crypto market caps&amp;amp;#39; are basically a meme, completely detached from reality. Of course market caps are hardly ever a true reflection of what company is worth, but they are a reflection of the amount of speculation in the current market. Just to look at a few:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cardano MC $36 billion, doesn&amp;amp;#39;t have fully functional smart contracts, lots of promises while continually underdelivering, if at all.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Solana: MC $30 billion, has been unusable for the last 48 hours, has suffered multiple outages over the last 6 months which lasted up to 17 hours.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Dogecoin: $18 billion MC....don&amp;amp;#39;t think I need to go into more detail on this one.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Ethereum: $288 billion market cap, supposed to disrupt the global banking industry (along with everything else), meanwhile it costs $200 for a simple ERC20 token swap.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;BTC: $665 billion market cap, supposed to be the future of digital store of value, meanwhile, has lost more than 50% in value over the course of 2.5 months.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;etc....&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The point is that these market caps aren&amp;amp;#39;t a reflection of the current states of those projects, but rather their promised states at some future point in time. Unless that point in time is very close as in a few months away, that&amp;amp;#39;s not sustainable. I personally don&amp;amp;#39;t think that point in time is very close, as almost nothing in crypto currency works as advertised.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;What would a multi year global bear market mean for crypto?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- BTC bleeds more than stock market&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- ETH bleeds more than BTC&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- Alts will bleed even heavier than ETH and a good number will never recover. You have to remember something very basic here: if an alt your holding loses 90% of its value in the bear market, it has to pull a 10X just to get back to its previous price.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Further complication:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;DCAing into projects is obviously the way to go in a bear market, but it becomes more difficult to predict what projects will have merit the longer the bear market continues. Will your favourite project still be relevant in 2024 or will it be replaced by something that hasn&amp;amp;#39;t even launched and won&amp;amp;#39;t until 2023? The longer the bear market lasts, the more likely that outcome becomes. Do lots of research, try to keep up with the tech developments in crypto. The next Solana or Luna is probably being planned as I write this. Try to find it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How many people wished to buy the coin at $35k when it was lik $60k? Like everyone was telling that they wished they had bought more. Now everyone is afraid to do so.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;People predict another crash in March 2022 because of the increasing interest rates. Let&amp;amp;#39;s see how it works out, usually the opposite happens what this sub thinks. Just my 2 cents.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;First of all, Bukele is a dictator who has been using institution to concentrate all power in his own hand : &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2020/05/07/nayib-bukeles-power-grab-in-el-salvador&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2020/05/07/nayib-bukeles-power-grab-in-el-salvador&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He uses the powers he has concentrated to enrich himself on the backs of Salvadorans. The economic policy that he leads in his country is disconnected from reality and is certainly a vast scam for his own enrichment.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then, 41.6% of the population lives below the poverty line, the country has a Gini coefficient of 0.47. His repeated purchases of bitcoin in a country with limited resources risks plunging the economy into an even worse state than it already is.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Finally, we are not talking about an individual investing his money in a risky way, we are talking about a leader betting his country&amp;amp;#39;s economy (in short the wealth of his population) in something risky and very volatile.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He is most certainly plunging his country into an unprecedented economic crisis: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://fortune.com/2022/01/19/el-salvador-bitcoin-economy-distressed-debt/&quot;&amp;gt;https://fortune.com/2022/01/19/el-salvador-bitcoin-economy-distressed-debt/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;His actions will have real consequences if the country goes into an economic crisis. Unemployment, suicide, poverty and its consequences.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitcoin was created by crytpo-anarchists who abhor this kind of person. Let&amp;amp;#39;s not forget that and let&amp;amp;#39;s not glorify dictators who want to use Bitcoin to get rich on the backs of their people.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And, yeah, I get we should be lighthearted during this substantial crash, but let&amp;amp;#39;s also not solely turn into brainless idiots like the fools over on WSB fighting for GME. Phrases like &amp;amp;quot;we don&amp;amp;#39;t know shit about fuck&amp;amp;quot; and all the &amp;amp;quot;my wife...&amp;amp;quot; comments are cringe. &amp;amp;quot;I reached wife-changing money.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

People were selling millions of dollar worth &amp;amp;quot;profile pictures&amp;amp;quot;. Scams and hacks were a daily occurrence. The NFT space was and continues to be a perpetual clown show, lions, penguins, dogs, punk jpegs being sold for thousands of dollars. What even is this market. It puts every other bubble in history of mankind to shame. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you wonder why the non-crypto crowd hates crypto and NFT viciously, it‚Äôs not an isolated incident or two, but a culmination of multiple events that are textbook examples of the worst capitalism has to offer. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Earlier in 2021, when I saw hit pieces against crypto, I thought they were quite wrong and were attacking crypto as they missed out on the gains. But over time it&amp;amp;#39;s very clear that there is a lot of merit to the attacks on crypto. The entire space has become a circus of greed, scams, zero sum offerings where one is looking to profit from another. If you go to other reddit subs like &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/technology&quot;&amp;gt;r/technology&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, they are all spot on about crypto, the whole space is one big clown world detached from fundamentals. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You dont even need to bring in energy consumption into this, even without it crypto is a market aggregating the worsts of the worst. Even now, there is little to no real world adoption of crypto, and instead you have a perpetual grifting scheme where people rush into new launches just to dump them at a higher value and profit off late entrants. Think 2017 cycle but on steroids with thousands of new coins. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You have exchanges and other large players legitimising ponzi schemes by giving them attention and even running dog money competitions. You had large defi protocols add ponzi tokens as collateral. Guess what happens to that $100k loan that was taken out using OHM as collateral, when OHM itself crashes 80% in a matter of weeks. A culmination of all of these is cascading liquidations and steep corrections. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You have coins with 50 BN FDV, where insiders hold 90% of the supply and retail buys these coins at the very top because they told to FOMOing into every coin that an exchange adds. In particular, what FTX and the whole scam Sam ecosystem they have encouraged is disgusting, if not downright criminal. Institutions and VCs got into these coins at cents to the dollar valuation, and exchanges added them at exorbitant valuations allowing the insiders to cash out handsomely within just weeks. Influencers and ponzi pumpers ran with ‚ÄúFDV is a meme‚Äù narrative so that they can encourage retail to pile into these scams.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you were even a small sized fund in this space, your limited partners were all chasing for maximal returns and exchanges facilitated all of this greed, all of them except retail knew that the loose monetary policy wasn‚Äôt going to last, and it was time to make the most out of it. Ultimately it‚Äôs the retail user and the crypto as a whole itself that suffers. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For a regular user of &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/technology&quot;&amp;gt;r/technology&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, he probably woudn&amp;amp;#39;t care that its Alameda Research or A16Z thats behind a lot of these worthless hype tokens, but his indictment would fall on crypto as a whole. The partner of a crypto VC fund gives zero fucks if crypto&amp;amp;#39;s reputation goes down the drain, he has made his millions and is happy collecting his share of profits.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you really believe in the tech and vision of crypto, you have every reason to be angry about what the space has turned into since the pandemic crash. It has been one relentless machine churning out scam after scam. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A bear market offers actual builders to work in peace building good products that the users needs, while removing all the baggage that comes with increasing prices and the vicious cycle of people looking to profit from one another, and heightened regulatory attention that grifters and scams bring to crypto as a whole. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto has a lot to offer the world, but only if the right products are built offering value to users. A ponzi farm and fork of a liquidity mining pool aint it, champ.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Now obviously to a certain degree that is true but just like 2017 I am almost certain some coins seen in the top 50 today will not be seen again reaching its previous ATH, probably forever. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The key here is to invest in what you believe in rather than picking a few random coins in the top 50 and holding them without even knowing their utility. Because In a situation like now you are probably trying to break even at minimum and move on. This is completely the wrong idea. First off, always research your investments utility and if you picked some coins blindly based off social media for example, research what they do NOW, and I don‚Äôt mean reading the Coinbase info on the coin, properly understand the fundamentals. If you have a solid understanding of its function and believe it will be of use in the future then Hold. Or even invest more. If it simply does nothing of use I wouldn‚Äôt wait to break even, it is most likely the time to cut your losses and find promising useful coins. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I am interested to know which coins people here believe won‚Äôt reach their ATH again that are in the top 50.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bull markets make your rich but bear markets make you wealthy&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: seems ICP and nano are quite popular, but does anyone believe some top 15 coins won‚Äôt be seen again tho and why?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Are you guys following the pattern ?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Right now proof-of-stake is becoming more and more centralized, not the blockchains itself, but the validators. The &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;same validators&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; are validating across multiple different networks - and it makes sense, after all, they can have dedicated hardware/marketing team/etc just to do that, and honestly, probably it is extremely profitable.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And it creates one huge problem:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;We became dependent of a few set of people/companies that are validating transactions across multiple blockchains&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And why is that a problem ? Well, first off, it becomes more and more a system we need to trust. A secondly, it stops being **censorship resistant**. You see, if govs across the world just wanted to delete bitcoin or monero from existence, they couldn&amp;amp;#39;t. They would be able to tank the price, probably, but they wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t have that much of an effect, because it would be very hard to keep looking for miners across the world, if not impossible.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But validators... it should be decentralized, but it is not. You can easily see where most of these people live and honestly, you can easily track basically all the validators of a network from their websites, specially governments. It becomes so much easier from governments to become able to interfere with the blockchain and, just like that, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;the censhorship resistance aspect of the blockchain technology no longer exists.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I know you wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t be able to just &amp;amp;quot;delete&amp;amp;quot; the blockchain by going after the validators. But you could have so much impact in basically.... &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;all proof-of-stake blockchains by doing so.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyways, english is not my first language, so i&amp;amp;#39;m sorry for any grammar mistakes.I just wanted to share this with you guys and get some opinions on it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
