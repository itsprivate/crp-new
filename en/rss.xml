&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Centralised payment rails can easily be censored by governments. Using them is literally asking to get de-platformed. Not just this time around, GoFundMe has a history of freezing users funds for a number of reasons. Its just similar to PayPal where you have to jump through hoops just to access the funds sent for your cause. They may not overtly admit it, but a company like GoFundMe must be under a lot of pressure by governments to freeze funds that are meant for anti-government protestors. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If crypto is too volatile for them, they can use decentralised stablecoins to raise funds. Something like DAI can be most useful in this scenario - it cannot be frozen, and can be easily exchanged for fiat. Protests are completely legal in most jurisdictions and these protestors have said they will be using the funds for fuel, food and lodgings in taking part in the convoy - all of which is legal. With a crypto credit card, they can spend their DAI or any other coin for all their activities. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Why they dont prefer using crypto payment rails over GoFundMe is bewildering. Maybe crypto platforms need more awareness.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now is a perfect time for rebalancing portfolios and pumping out of short term gains into long term projects that have strong foundations and can survive the winter.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you trust a project, 100% believe in it, its easy to hold through the volatility and fud. I have seen shifting my assets from low capped coins that were showing good profits into mainly ETH and BTC. Why? Because sats. During winter one should always focus on grinding the sats. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Rebalancing is imho one of the things that many dont do and later regret it.

&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Daniel Sestagalli a known reputable person in the crypto space and his team created an OHM Fork and DAO called &amp;amp;quot;Wonderland&amp;amp;quot; on the Avalanche network.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Wonderland offered an insane 80000% APY on its launch (10x that of Olympus) for staking its token &amp;amp;quot;TIME&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The project gained mass popularity right from its launch due to its high APY and Daniel&amp;amp;#39;s pre existing followers.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The price of TIME token peaked to an all time high of $10k from about $2000 within a month.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Wonderland gained its maximum investors between mid november and end november. TIME was trading on an average of $8000 at that time.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Nobody thought that Wonderland would rug since its founder was doxxed. Anybody who thought otherwise would instantly be labelled as a FUDster.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Any valid question or criticism of the project was suppressed and downvoted claiming to be FUD. The founders of the project promoted it.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Sifu, an anonymous person who claimed to be working in a major finance company in US was in charge of managing the $1 billion dollar treasury of Wonderland.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Daniel regularly used to act like a &amp;amp;quot;people&amp;amp;#39;s man&amp;amp;quot; by tweeting stuff like, &amp;amp;quot;fuck the suits&amp;amp;quot;, &amp;amp;quot;fuck the VC&amp;amp;#39;s&amp;amp;quot;, &amp;amp;quot;fuck the whales&amp;amp;quot;. Basically, man used to preach about decentralisation alot. His followers slowly turned into a cult who used to worship him no matter what decisions he made.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Despite being a DAO, majority of people who invested in Wonderland believed that decision making should be done by Daniel and Sifu only, giving them too much power right from the beginning.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The project with its ridiculous &amp;amp;quot;lambo calculator&amp;amp;quot; gave many false hopes to people. $1k worth of TIME would become worth millions in one year. Many people invested way more than what they were willing to lose. Someone put in his house down payment, someone put in his student loan in the hopes of becoming millionaire at the end of the year.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Everything was working fine until the entire crypto market crashed in January. TIME price started to plummet losing around 20% of its value every weak (sometimes everyday). The price started dipping from an average of $8000 to $6000, then $4000, then $2000. Nothing was stopping the price drop.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;People had already lost more than 50% of their investment in less than a month. But the &amp;amp;quot;price doesn&amp;amp;#39;t matter, the APY will cover it up in a year&amp;amp;quot; attitude of people kept them clinging to this project.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Any concerns or questions about TIME&amp;amp;#39;S price tanking were dismissed by saying &amp;amp;quot;Bitcoin is also down&amp;amp;quot; and &amp;amp;quot;it&amp;amp;#39;s just whales selling to buy back at cheaper rate&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;While the price kept tanking weeks after weeks, the team kept on supplying hopium to the people. Sifu claimed that they will be investing the treasury money into several projects that will generate them revenue in the long run.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The very first investment was supposed to be a sports betting platform called Betswap.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Sifu promised that holders of TIME who did not sell even after the crash would receive an airdrop of BSGG (betting platform&amp;amp;#39;s official token) coins as a gift for having faith in the project.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Needless to say, the airdrop never happened. It was supposed to happen &amp;amp;quot;next week&amp;amp;quot; but which &amp;amp;quot;next week&amp;amp;quot; was never clarified. Questions about the airdrop were dodged by saying &amp;amp;quot;technical issue&amp;amp;quot;, &amp;amp;quot;coding error&amp;amp;quot; by Sifu.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Several other projects were also announced as part of our investment which never saw the light of day.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The team had promised that if the price of TIME fell below the backing price, they would do huge buybacks from treasury so that the price doesn&amp;amp;#39;t drop any further. (For example, if the price of TIME was $3000 and its backing price was $2000, and suddenly the price of TIME crashed to $1500, the team would initiate buybacks, i.e buying TIME until the price reached the backing price of $2000)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The backing price of TIME was once $2300. As expected, the price fell below $2000 but no buybacks were done. After some time the backing price fell to just $1000 per TIME.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Again the price of TIME fell below $1000, but this time Sifu did the buyback and bragged about it how they are not like other DAOs and they actually do buy backs.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The price of TIME stayed above $1000 for like 2 days after it fell again.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;This is when things start getting spicier. One fine day, the price of TIME tanks 50% from $1000 to about $500, yes in a single day.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;There was panic all around the community having the same question, &amp;amp;quot;what the fuck happened&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Basically there was a mass selling in a certain hour by whales.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Daniel and Sifu, the founders of project did not do the buybacks because they were &amp;amp;quot;sleeping&amp;amp;quot;. Alot of people who had kept TIME as a collateral to borrow stable coins from &amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://abracadabra.money/&quot;&amp;gt;abracadabra.money&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; (another Daniel&amp;amp;#39;s project) got liquidated. The people who used TIME to borrow crypto believed that the price would never tank so hard because the team would do buybacks.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;But since Daniel was sleeping and he forgot to do the buyback (lol), so many people got liquidated, including Daniel and Sifu themselves.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Daniel tried to act all innocent tweeting he did not know any of this and he was just sleeping. And since he lost money too, noone doubted him.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Just one day after this shitshow another news breaks out that Sifu, the treasury manager is the founder of a collapsed CEX called &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/27/wonderland-rattled-after-cofounder-tied-to-alleged-quadrigacx-190m-exit-scam/&quot;&amp;gt;Quadriga&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and a known fraudster who has been scamming people for about 2 decades.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The price of TIME falls to an all time low of $300 after this news.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Daniel claimed that he knew about Sifu&amp;amp;#39;s identify from 1 month ago but he did not take any action because he believes in giving second chances.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Following the outrage by the community, Sifu was removed from Wonderland as the treasury manager through vote.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;After this, Daniel makes another proposal the next day. He gives the people two choices. Abandon the project, do one more buyback and take the TIME price above backing by draining the treasury or to keep the project alive and assemble a new team within 5 days.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The first option was nothing but a tight slap to long time holders face. People who had invested in this project from the beginning had lost more than 90% of their wealth. Draining the treasury would only give them about 10-15% of their investments back.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Meanwhile the whales saw the opportunity to make some quick cash through this. They bought a shit ton amount of TIME for $300 each, while the backing price was almost $600. That would mean that after the buyback (if option 1 wins) the whales would double their money in 2 days while long term holders will only get 10% of their money back.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The votes started kicking in and as expected top 20 whales made 70% of the votes in favor of option 1 while thousands of other voters with less TIME and voting power made only 30% in favor of option 2.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Basically except the whales who joined in just 1 day ago, noone else was benefiting from draining the treasury and everybody else wanted the project to continue.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;But but but, even though a bunch of whales had a lot of voting power, they lost the lead because an overwhelming majority voted for option 2 and won.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Daniel who wanted to drain the treasury after seeing the result dismisses the vote not respecting the proposal. And says some bullshit like &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/danielesesta/status/1487826195978899457?s=20&amp;amp;amp;t=LT0_MYYQKSUpnv7pNmJZFQ&quot;&amp;gt;this&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;So, what actually happened here?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In short:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;This was all part of a huge scam carried out by Daniel and Sifu.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Daniel knew all along about Sifu&amp;amp;#39;s identity.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Daniel got liquidated not because he was sleeping but he wanted to get liquidated. He had borrowed stablecoins by keeping TIME as collateral. He knew that TIME would be worth pennies in the next few days so he did not mind losing it all.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;If he had directly swapped TIME for any stablecoin people would have doubted him so instead he gets liquidated and tries to act all innocent.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Next day Sifu&amp;amp;#39;s identity is revealed, it was not found out by any detective, it was pre planned from the beginning. (also there&amp;amp;#39;s no proof that Sifu is Omar, it might just be another one of their tactics)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;After the price tanks to $300, Daniel, Sifu and everybody on his team create several new wallets, buy millions worth of TIME at such a cheap rate and then Daniel announces that there would be a vote to distribute the treasury to TIME holders with proportion to their holdings.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Daniel knew that the he and his team would win the proposal because they had a lot of voting power with their alt wallets.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Things don&amp;amp;#39;t turn out his way and he loses the proposal so today he comes with another proposal that the ones who want out of this project can go with their money.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Inevitably Daniel and his team are gonna win this proposal or any other proposal coming after this and they will cash out their millions of dollars while everybody else would be getting screwed.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;At the end no one would be after Daniel, because he was &amp;amp;quot;innocent&amp;amp;quot; and the project failed due to bad luck. After a few months he will start another scam project and use similar tactics to loot people&amp;amp;#39;s money all while maintaining his goodwill.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;GG Daniel &amp;amp;amp; Sifu, you played everyone&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;(sorry for bad english)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Edit:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; For people saying that the insane APY was a red flag itself, it was but people were under the impression that it would not be a rugged since the founder was doxxed. What people feared was the price and APY of TIME dropping (just like Olympus). If the calculator showed them 500x return in one year, people would take the worst case scenario like &amp;amp;quot;even if I don&amp;amp;#39;t get 500x, I will atleast get 5x&amp;amp;quot; which is still good.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You are constantly looking for promising buying opportunities.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You love the thrill of a volatile market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You are an investor if you are:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;1.looking for long term profit. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Don&amp;amp;#39;t want to spend much time/energy following price movements. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Want to sleep well at night.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Willing to leave your money in one place for a long time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now if you are an investor, you should be ready to wait for the next bull run. So stop bitching about the prices and move on.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you are a trader then you should have minimized your losses at the start of the bear cycle. If you didn&amp;amp;#39;t, then you clearly are not good at what you are doing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you are a trader you should try using the hype around coins and sell without being too greedy. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you are an investor just ignore the hype! You want something with long term prospect. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Just decide what you want to be and stick to it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: it seems I have to write another piece about &amp;amp;quot;why you can&amp;amp;#39;t be both&amp;amp;quot; soon. Half of what people say in comments about being both a trader and investor are actually still being only one of them.
My understanding is most people here are short term investors. At least according to more than 300 comments I have read so far. And we have very very few actual traders in here.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Happy Sunday by the way! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m pretty new to everything and googled my question and most, if not all articles tell me it&amp;amp;#39;s because they are meme based and don&amp;amp;#39;t have any functionality other than making money. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At first I though fair enough, but after googling some of the top 20 &amp;amp;quot;alt coins&amp;amp;quot; ADA for instance, I can&amp;amp;#39;t seem to see any use case function for this at all? If it was called a funny name, would it be a shitcoin or is it because it&amp;amp;#39;s not meme based it&amp;amp;#39;s an alt? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Monero for instance, I can see why this is popular due to its privacy and as far as I can see I&amp;amp;#39;d the only coin that has this feature, however quite a few alt coins I&amp;amp;#39;ve checked out don&amp;amp;#39;t seem to be any different than shitcoins. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Very confusing. Or is it all just a matter of opinon?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;EDIT: 6 people have told me I&amp;amp;#39;m an idiot because of my ADA comment, yet not one ahs explained to me it&amp;amp;#39;s use case. Calling me an idiot or a troll isn&amp;amp;#39;t helping your case is it? I read their website and it&amp;amp;#39;s nothing but vague roadmaps.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It wasn&amp;amp;#39;t a dig just a mere observation, please teach me if I&amp;amp;#39;m wrong.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

But currently, I think it&amp;amp;#39;s very possible for BTC to tank down to 20k right after I get tired of waiting and buy this dip.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These types of highly unpredictable and abnormally volatile markets are throwing me off, and I&amp;amp;#39;m waiting for some more predictability, whether it&amp;amp;#39;s positive or negative price action.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Jokes aside, I think this is terrible for crypto. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Firstly, one man can indirectly control the markets without even meaning to (at least, he didn&amp;amp;#39;t mean to in this case). Secondly, it is projects like this that makes the average retail investor think that crypto is a pyramid scheme/scam. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As an asset class, crypto needs to move away from these sort of projects and focus on fundamentals etc. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;1.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Increases decentralization&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To run a Lightning Node, you have to also be running a fully synced Bitcoin Core node. This simple technical requirement means that the number of full Bitcoin nodes is going to explode. Bitcoin  nodes are the most important part of the network since they enforce the consensus rules. Therefore, the more nodes, the better level of the decentralization and the more immune the Bitcoin Network will be to consensus rules change as we saw during the Blocksize war. For example, if someone wanted to change our beloved 21 million fixed supply, they would have to convince a substantial majority of people. The more nodes and the more spread out they are across the globe, the more impossible this tasks becomes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However, I&amp;amp;#39;ve always felt that the incentives for an individual running a Bitcoin Node were never that strong. It was always sold as “&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;having full sovereignty over your transactions by not needing to be trust any third party&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;.” But this is only going to convince a small group of people. A second argument that does have a bit more reach is the altruistic argument, “&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;you should run a bitcoin node to help out the network&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;.” Many hardcore bitcoiners probably run their nodes for this reason, but it is not a sustainable value proposition for the long term and won´t allow us to reach the insanely high level of decentralization mandated by a global trustless currency.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I believe the incentives for running a Lightning Node, which implies running a Bitcoin Node under the hood, are far far stronger. First of all, if you are an individual or medium to large business that is going to be making and/or receiving a lot of transactions, you can use your own lightning node to make sure you&amp;amp;#39;ll always be playing lowest possible fees. As a merchant with your own node, you can make sure your customers will pay the minimum fees for buying one of your products or if you are paying suppliers you can ensure that your node will search for the shortest route and minimize your fees paid. You can of course use a free custodial third party that avoids the hassle of installing your own lightning node but you will end up paying higher fees over the long run, that&amp;amp;#39;s how they make their money of course. So a very simple and selfish incentive emerges: people will run lightning nodes so that they can save money. A time tried incentive that is pretty effective.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But an even stronger incentive than saving money is making money. Many people already run what are called routing nodes, with the only purpose of routing payments and taking a small fee every time. This is in fact the main reason why people are interested in running a Lightning node in order to generate a small secondary income stream.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Finally, the third selfish incentive is that for some sad nerdy people, like myself, running a node actually is fun! There is a growing group of hobbyists that enjoy maintaining their nodes and participating in the network as a whole, just check out &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://plebnet.wiki/wiki/Welcome_to_Plebnet&quot;&amp;gt;PlebNet &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;for proof of this. Unlike running a simple Bitcoin node where you simply get it up and running and then just watch it sit there, running a Lightning Network involves active maintanance by rebalancing channels or figuring which nodes to connect to. This community involvement effect has definitely been a driver for adoption.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These three incentives are much stronger than anything preceding them, and it simply means that many more people will want to run a Lightning note and therefore as a by-product they will also be running a Bitcoin node, whether they want to or not and whether they even know it or not. The end result is a far more decentralized network which will take Bitcoin´s most valuable attribute, decentralization, to a whole new level.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;2. Solves the privacy tradeoff&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The criticism that both Edward Snowden and Eric Weinstein have made of Bitcoin, which is for me the only reasonable criticism of the protocol I have heard, is its lack of privacy on the base layer. The issue is that there needs to be a public record for every transaction as a by-product of having a decentralized blockchain. Buying Bitcoin without KYC is becoming increasingly a legal grey area, and the ability for people to track transactions threatens one of Bitcoin&amp;amp;#39;s most important features: &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;fungibility&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. If certain coins have a shady history, they might be worth less, while freshly mined coins can be sold at a premium. This is not good.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But the Lightning Network comes to the rescue.  When you open a Lightning channel, you are sending funds to a 2 of 2 multisig address and from there they do not move, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;ever&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, until the channel is closed. With taproot now deployed, we will be able to able to hide that it&amp;amp;#39;s a a multisig, so therefore hide that´s it&amp;amp;#39;s problably a channel opening transaction. Lightning should be integrating this in the next few years &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You transact on the Lightning network by exchanging and updating IOUs with your channel peer, as many times as required. This is 100% private, these transactions are fully within your custody and nobody can ever know how or what you spent your money on. Even nodes re-routing payments cannot know the sender and the receiver.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Lightning Network does not increase the privacy of payment, it makes payments &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;100% private&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Absolutely and unequivocally private&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. End of.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is an insane innovation when you think about it, not only are payments still permissionless and uncensorable, they are now also uncompromisingly private, no longer suffering from the trade-off of having to transact on a public ledger like the base Bitcoin layer does.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And my favourite part of this is that when you take your funds back onto the Bitcoin network, their traceability have also almost been entirely eliminated. Imagine that you buy 1m Satoshis from a fully KYC´ed exchange and then move your Sats from the exchange to your wallet and then from there you open a Lightning channel with a well-connected node in order to spend your Bitcoin. Let&amp;amp;#39;s say you go on a bit of a shopping spree and you end up spending around 800K Satoshis. You decide that it would be wiser to save your remaining 200,000 sats by sending to your cold storage, so you close your Lightning channel, which means you move that amount from the multisig address to your cold wallet address. If you use a fresh address (which wallets will almost always generate automatically even if you are sending back to the same wallet), then there is absolutely no way on-chain analysis can know which UXTO is yours and which belongs to the other channel peer. They will see two transactions on the Blockchain with no idea which belongs to who. And funnily enough, if you spent the entire amount you put in to channel, when closing it there would only be one transaction on the blockchain and again nobody will know if those Sats are going back to you in or to the other owner of the node,  and so nobody knows if you spent the entirety o none of your coins. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;What in essence you have done is an ad hoc CoinJoin which severs the relationship between your KYC account and your Bitcoin&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. (As along as you do not use the same address as you opened the channel with, it goes without saying).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Even if the chain analysis makes the assumption that you spent all your Bitcoin,it is impossible for them to know what you spent it on and where those Satoshis now are.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Privacy solved.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;3.  Makes every altcoin irrelevant&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One way of understanding s*** coins  is to think of them as being a counterfeit copy of the Bitcoin protocole and token, pretending to offer a better or more specialized version of it when in reality they only dillute the value of Bitcoin´s market cap and serve as a very pesky distraction for many newcomers. This is an unfortunate consequence of Bitcoin´s open source nature, and the threat posed by s*** coins in the short to medium term is far larger than what many think.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However, the traction already garnered by the Lightning network and it&amp;amp;#39;s capabilities really do put the shame all other coins that supposedly are solving Bitcoins scalability limitations. Many s*** coins sacrifice decentralization for more transactional efficiency. Meanwhile, the Lightning network achieves the highest speed of transaction at a ridiculously low costs without sacrificing in any shape or form the decentralized and secure properties of the underlying Bitcoin network. This makes other sh**coins completely irrelevant. And the number of users between both is an undeniable proof of this. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Millions&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; of people use the Lightning network to make transactions &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;everyday&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;And when I say millions I am not exaggerating&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. No other s*** coin even comes close to this number.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Another subset of sh** coins claim to use blockchain technologies for non-monetary use cases such as messaging or logistics or art. The whole Web 3.0 blurb. However, every single one of these ideas can be built far more easily on the Lightning network, and they already are. They are known as LAPPS. These are considered as layer 3 solutions and tackle specific problems. Of course many of these will fail just like in any free market but at least they won´t be stealing people&amp;amp;#39;s money when doing so, since investing in these solutions will go through the traditional private market. There is no publicly available token for people to be swindled into buying.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sphinx and Zion are a great example of this. Again I&amp;amp;#39;m not saying that these are going to be successful, but they are proof that we do not need to be creating completely new chains and pouring capital into them in order to try use cases that by definition are aimed at a small niche of users. I really hope the Lightning Network exposes the Altcoin ecosystem for the inefficient capital draining and overhyped speculation that it really is. Smart entrepreneurs will soon understand that it is far cheaper and efficient to build and fail and iterate on the Lightning network. And in the long term, only smart entrepreneurs win.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;4. Offers a Proof-of-Stake Alternative&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This rarely gets mentioned, but it&amp;amp;#39;s simple enough to understand. Imagine you could lock up your Bitcoin and get rewarded on a percentage basis for processing transactions. Sounds very much like proof of stake, right?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Well, the Lightning network offers you that option. Nodes can charge a small transaction fee for routing payments between unconnected nodes. This means you get a small financial reward for providing the liquidity the network needs. This offers pretty clear competition to what Ethereum is trying so hard and yet failing so far to implement. And unlike Ethereum, the Lightning´s network equivalent of staking is available today.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Imagine you were a large whale, and you wanted to earn a predictable yield on your Bitcoin &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;while retaining custody&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; (this last bit is key). The Lightning Network, unlike anything else in the ecosystem, would allow you to do this. Right now the fees a node can obtain for routing are very low, but this is because for now supply outstrips demand, but if the Lightning Network´s adoption continues at the rate it&amp;amp;#39;s at, then this will soon change.I can envision a near future where there are staking pools which groups together people&amp;amp;#39;s liquidity to create a very well-connected routing node and collect fees, redistributing them out to their clients after taking a small commission for managing the node.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;5. Makes price volatility irrelevant.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitcoin&amp;amp;#39;s critics cite volatility as an unsurmountable problem which means it will never become a viable currency , when in fact its volatility is just a temporary feature caused by its insanely fast monetization.But anyway, I understand the frustration of making an on-chain transaction and having to wait 6 confirmations (roughly 1 hour) during which Bitcoin´s fiat price could have drastically shifted. This is not great for international transactions or any circumstance where you are using Bitcoin as a bridge between two fiat currencies. (Far better than anything the legacy financial system can offer, mind you).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Again problem solved with the Lightning Network, the instantaneous nature of its transactions mean that you convert instantly in fiat, locking in your agreed price. Strike and &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.opennode.com/&quot;&amp;gt;OpenNode&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; have shown that this is a key advantage of using the Lightning Network around which they are building their business models.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;How you can help&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So to close out, if this little post has got you more curious about the Lightning network, here are a few things you can do to help out.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Run your own node&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; (it´s fun I promise)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Show friends, families, local business how the Lightning Network works &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;and give them a demonstration&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. Most people are genuinely impressed by its speed and low transaction cost when they see it with their own eyes.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Contribute to open source code or &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;create services for the growing community of node runners&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. There is so much still to build.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Reimagine how existing services could be improved when powered by the Lightning Network&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. Pay-Per-Second Podcasting, Reddit comment tipping with microSats, Fully custodial online poker… So many fun things to launch!&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Why?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Because buying a house, owning some property, or even renting a place has seen prices increase substantially; especially here in Canada, where housing prices jumped over 26% last year. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I’m not investing on a whim; I take the time to learn the fundamentals and do my research. I buy solid crypto that I personally believe in for the long term. I’m fine waiting, practicing patience, and accumulating over time. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I don’t expect to become rich, and I know damn well I won’t wakeup a millionaire one day. However, I have faith and am optimistic about the future of some projects I hold, like CRO and ALGO for example. (ETH and BTC too, of course). &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Good things come to those who wait. May we all prosper!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Little edit: the feedback I’m receiving is exactly why I love this community so much, thank you all for the kind words! I genuinely hope you all find financial freedom one day.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

You mean that magic internet money? &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s like, you want decent interest returns for holding your money and lower fees on transactions? Yes! Then stop using the middle man of a bank and start using crypto and stop letting your money get eroded by fees and inflation........But banks are safe for my money, I have a savings account with 0.0000000% interest!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/qq08n4p1wue81.png?width=1280&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=4e772b740c4853c817c94ec895393357a2f7ec4d&quot;&amp;gt;Banks! It&amp;amp;#39;s got what you crave! It&amp;amp;#39;s got interest!*&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You don&amp;amp;#39;t have a savings account with a bank you have lies, they give you a few $$s here and there while they are making huge investments out of your money AND the inflation is actually depleting your savings account even more money. They should be called deflation accounts and not savings accounts!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/b7ns8hupwue81.png?width=1274&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e8ac93cfdb9a993d6171e5c6aa2bf20e33b3063f&quot;&amp;gt;Yeah we decided not to have any children because we cannot afford to now that we let all our money deflate to near zero value instead of investing it in the future of finance&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Of course I have to add not to dump ALL that you have into the nearest shitcoin and wait for &amp;amp;#39;those lambos&amp;amp;#39; to arrive but people that aren&amp;amp;#39;t invested at all in crypto or who paper hand out at the first dip are going to seriously regret it down the road! Those that become their own banks and handle their own finance are going to have significantly more wealth the longer we go while those that let the middle men of banking horde their money will find they have nothing left!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I know all of us could use some juicy $.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But hear me out. Just like the web long before it , each blockchain architecture serves a different purpose. Sure some will disappear. Sure some might do one or two thing better than another. But the most likely scenario for the future of crypto is a network of integrated blockchains working together.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some will provide security. Some will do transactions and so one. Better projects will replace older ones and the whole concept will live on. It is just short sighted to think one specific chain would solve every problem and provide every service. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto needs to be flexible and evolve according to needs of people/enterprises or else it will fall apart. Don&amp;amp;#39;t defend a single project like it is your religion. The important thing is for crypto revolution to move on and become a part of life for every human being on earth.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is bigger than any single project. Please try to understand this.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Ps: I thought it was obvious but seems I have to clarify it. By &amp;amp;quot;not any single project&amp;amp;quot; I don&amp;amp;#39;t mean &amp;amp;quot;every shitty&amp;amp;quot; project will win or survive. Maybe less than a percent of current projects are legit. 
I was talking about several successful project in different application categories. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Best regards&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://i.redd.it/lnne0752iwe81.gif&quot;&amp;gt;F.U.D. Courtesy of The Fed&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A LOT has changed since NOV ATHs....&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We sit on the edge of a Bear Market in many assets, and have a new 8000lb Gorilla in the room, (a hawkish FED that um, day trades).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Meanwhile, crypto has recently correlated with the VIX (-94% on Friday), so now the SPX and Crypto are joined at the hip:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/dyrvahorewe81.png?width=722&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=74c66bf65f603426cfd18723b4e169d7a6c91006&quot;&amp;gt;ATHs in VIX Correlation&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What&amp;amp;#39;s interesting here is how much the order book has dried up. The book is running very thin (that trend is ongoing), which means that prices can bounce a lot more then would otherwise be the case. It also means that prices will likely come under even more pressure (high volatility does not support price increases in the average asset), in the short term.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Additionally, this set up may create some extra wild price swings that may whack the over leveraged margin &amp;amp;amp; futures traders. How that will affect Exchange Operability remains to be seen-but let&amp;amp;#39;s just say it won&amp;amp;#39;t help them stay more stable. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;;)&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here are some charts that help illustrate the problem, they look like  Rorschach (ink blot) Tests:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/2322juyfewe81.png?width=925&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=d6deb7aa59f8cde5abc8249b93b7a51836556e5e&quot;&amp;gt;S&amp;amp;amp;P Book Depth Is Shrinking...see that flash crash point in DEC Week 1?&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/18u5bnxhfwe81.png?width=950&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=c185674b9ffbcb996c7d8b516ff4e4a11e2b351c&quot;&amp;gt;Nasdaq Book Depth Is Shrinking...&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/o6npfgawfwe81.png?width=929&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=aaad2c1a72e6971e9823ad5ea853510216f968f8&quot;&amp;gt;Bid/Ask Spread is HUGE here.....&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These are indications that volatility is likely to remain significantly elevated in the days ahead-atop a level that is already very high. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;This also suggests that the price declines we have seen in the cryptoverse correction are not over.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; What&amp;amp;#39;s more, January is usually one of the most chill months for volatility-so the fact that we are already running high in a normally chill month-is note worthy here:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/119pzsqogwe81.png?width=946&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=7e4c3e50abe9504ee6c7d6a7d1229d95a079cdae&quot;&amp;gt;January is supposed to be chill bro&amp;amp;#39;......but ain&amp;amp;#39;t!&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here is a chart of Volatility, and Volatility of Volatility, overlaid:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/yzuib1g1qwe81.png?width=1150&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=9f83eee07ec3b8e4261700eb6921d814bf17c711&quot;&amp;gt;The VIX is Now Trending Up, Up, Up and away......&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At present, volatility is retreating off its highs, but the trend is clear-and that trend is UP. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Volatility is now bullish trend, where for all of 2021 it was not. That is a huge sea change. As long as the correlation to the VIX remains as titanium strong as it is at present, &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;this suggests that prices will remain under pressure for quite some time.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; (No Virginia, Coin #1 will not be hitting $100k any time soon-as in this year dear.)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Meanwhile the book is thinning to where it was at the December Flash crash.....ruh roh!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;I am not a chicken little, and I am not given to fear. That said, the set up here is ripe for whaler whack-a-mole, Skynet&amp;amp;#39;s favorite game of chance.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;The takeaway?:&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Traders: be on the margin watch!&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;HODLr&amp;amp;#39;s: buckle up for more roller coa$ter action.....&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TL,DR: We should start a campaign, here is our appeal:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;All wallet software orienting average user, shall ban the action of, or give the scariest warning it can give if the user initiates a tx that directly calls &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;transfer&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; function to a Contract address.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;We should promote and accelerate the deprecation of raw ERC-20, and the wider adoption of newer, more robust and fault-proof ERC-777 and ERC-1555 standards.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;No matter what role you are playing in the scene - Blockchain developers, DeFi users, NFT hodlers, investors, today&amp;amp;#39;s tragedy is a serious alarm to us all that, Ethereum, along with many other blockchain technologies, are yet to be fully fledged for mass adoption.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is fully understandable because the nature of new technologies is, no matter how many work we do to make the design perfect, it needs to be tested in the field first for problems to be reveal and fixed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;ERC-20 token standard is one of them, it&amp;amp;#39;s such a classic standard with long history and a whole ecosystem built upon it, but we all forgot that the philosophy behind its design is still immature, leading to serious loophole and design failure.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sending ERC-20 token to any sort of Smart Contract is pointless and exceedingly dangerous. In usual business logic, if user want a certain smart contract to have certain token, what they should do, and the way the Smart Contract should absolutely implement is: user approve in ERC-20 token contract first, then you make user to call a function exposed by your Contract, in the function, your Contract calls &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;transferFrom&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; function on ERC-20 Token Contract, so that your contract is aware of this transfer.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;An ERC-20 &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;transfer&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; function call, to ANY &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;CONTRACT&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; ADDRESS, initiated by END-USER (EOA address), is POINTLESS and will ALWAYS result in PERMANENT, UNRECOVEABLE TOKEN LOSS.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Today&amp;amp;#39;s tragedy is caused by collective effect of many factor: The nature of Ethereum that all addresses look the same; Lack of user education on smart contract (I see why people blaming &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://weth.io/&quot;&amp;gt;weth.io&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; on this, it&amp;amp;#39;s fully reasonable, today&amp;amp;#39;s victim might came up with the idea him/herself that: hey I send ETH to the contract, got WETH, now I send WETH back, ETH back, that&amp;amp;#39;s what the GIF on &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://weth.io/&quot;&amp;gt;weth.io&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; says! completely not knowing what&amp;amp;#39;s under the hood, the anonymous fallback function and etc.). Lack of on-chain logic checking and preventing this (it would cost everybody&amp;amp;#39;s gas).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But the most unforgivable factor is the NEGLIGENCE of wallet software: &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;ZERO&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; warning upon sending ERC-20 token to a Contract Address, on the UI I just saw &amp;amp;quot;Contract interaction: Transfer&amp;amp;quot;, and I&amp;amp;#39;m good to go! To PURGE ALL OF MY HODLING with single mouse click!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That&amp;amp;#39;s not how fault tolerance/fault proof should be done - to be honest, that&amp;amp;#39;s zero fault proof.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Green across the board, we are good to go right? POOOOF, SNAFU, a poor guy&amp;amp;#39;s life saving gone.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This issue has been around for years, and of course, everything on chain is accessible, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://etherscan.io/&quot;&amp;gt;etherscan.io&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; can tell if an address is a contract, Infura can tell if it&amp;amp;#39;s a contract. But metamask, ledger live, xxx wallet and etc cannot tell if the address in the text input is a contract.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So, once again in the end, We should start a campaign, here is our appeal:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;All wallet software orienting average user, shall ban the action of, or give the scariest warning it can give if the user initiates a tx that directly calls &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;transfer&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; function to a Contract address.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;We should promote and accelerate the deprecation of raw ERC-20, and the wider adoption of newer, more robust and fault-proof ERC-777 and ERC-1555 standards.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

The cryptocurrency rose astronomically within a short period of time, and crypto investors&amp;amp;#39; interest in the project was gigantic at times. Shiba Inu even made it into the top 10 largest cryptocurrencies. However, the price of Shiba Inu has since plummeted, and the hype and interest surrounding the project seems to have completely evaporated as well.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Google Trends&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In fact, last year Shiba Inu was so popular that it topped CoinMarketCap in terms of searches. Also on the Google, there was a huge search for, for example, &amp;amp;quot;Shiba Inu&amp;amp;quot; or &amp;amp;quot;Buy Shiba Inu&amp;amp;quot; all over the world.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However, this search volume on Google has totally dried up in the last 90 days. Google Trends shows that a peak in terms of interest was reached on October 29 last year. Since then, this search volume has plummeted by a whopping 92%!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/9lts5dtmyve81.png?width=1168&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e667ddbf9ad93d831e1f3d6f02d518bcc574f8c3&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/9lts5dtmyve81.png?width=1168&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e667ddbf9ad93d831e1f3d6f02d518bcc574f8c3&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Shiba Inu Price&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The price of meme-coin did not manage to perform much better in recent months. Since the all-time high set at the end of October 2021, the SHIB price has dropped more than 75%.  In fact, at the beginning of January, Shiba Inu&amp;amp;#39;s market capitalization plummeted by more than $3.5 billion in just one week.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Although the team at Shiba Inu is still working hard behind the scenes to get the project back on track, this seems to have become quite a task. Here and there SHIB still gets listed on a new crypto exchange, but the extreme price appreciation we saw in the past seems to be a thing of the past so far.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Of course, Shiba Inu is not the only cryptocurrency that is performing poorly at the moment. Due to the high uncertainty in both the crypto and equity markets, most cryptocurrencies are deep in the red. Nevertheless, the demise of SHIB can be called an outlier.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: Shib holders and fans, stop attacking me for pointing out your coin has had its day and people have moved to the next Doge/Shib, jeez, chillax and accept the bad investment choices you made&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There are many celebrities that have supposedly bought these NFTs and now have changed their profile picture to the Ape they own. Some of the prominent ones include Future, Lil Baby, and Jimmy Fallon all spending 500K+. And while I don’t doubt they couldn’t afford it as they are all obviously multimillionaires. I do not believe they are actually buying them. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My working theory is that they are simply getting them for or even getting paid to market these NFT’s and it’s just the NFT owners wash trading between their own ETH wallets to create Artificial demand and contribute to the price inflation. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The most recent one I saw was Justin Bieber buying an Ape NFT for around 500 ETH (over 1 million USD). When the base price of the NFT was 250K. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I refuse to believe celebrities at their own willingness are overpaying for these. Once again I understand that a celebrity like Justin Bieber could in theory afford to throw a million at something like this. But just doesn’t seem like something he would rationally do without ulterior motives. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Welcoming any thoughts people have on this? Just want to disclaim I am not against NFT’s and believe the tech and potential of it is amazing, but the current use case is absurd and indicative of a artificially inflated bubble(this is coming from someone that made a few ETH flipping NFTs)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
