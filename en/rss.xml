This week one of the top post of &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/cc&quot;&amp;gt;r/cc&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; was hopeful that NFT/blockchain ticketing could disrupt the ticketing industry. Are there any good alternatives for artists to use a different ticketing company than Ticketmaster?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Key to the success of any product is the customer experience. Any person should able to buy a ticket without any knowledge of crypto/blockchain/NFTs. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/enq9nr4euhs81.png?width=473&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=3928c81f2dfd7b61d669e5557a6c76e5c45576aa&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/enq9nr4euhs81.png?width=473&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=3928c81f2dfd7b61d669e5557a6c76e5c45576aa&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To test the consumer friendliness of NFT tickets. I bought an NFT ticket for a stadium show of a major artist in the Netherlands (capacity of the stadium is 30.000+, home to PSV for soccer/football fans). The ticketing company is GUTS a company that offer NFT ticketing using the GET protocol whitelabel product. There are 11 ticketing companies that use the GET protocol across the United States and Western Europe. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Buying the ticket&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The first step was to go to the site of the artist I wanted to buy a ticket from. When clicking on the buy button, I got redirected to the GUTS tickets site (see picture below). On the GUTS tickets site I created an account and verified my account with an SMS. This process took me about 30 sec.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/ywg23o0iuhs81.png?width=489&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=67b156703e007e21a957ef8e585aa312a13067c9&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/ywg23o0iuhs81.png?width=489&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=67b156703e007e21a957ef8e585aa312a13067c9&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The ticket in the app&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I selected a seat and bought the ticket with a fiat wire transfer. After completing the transfer I received my tickets in the mobile app of GUTS tickets (the ticketing company). &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The ticket is now transferred to my account in the app. The QR code is still locked and will open a few hours before the event. It is a dynamic QR code to prevent scalpers from screenshotting the ticket and put it up for sale for a large mark-up on secondary ticket sale market like Viagogo&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/7gs9nn5zuhs81.png?width=247&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=b551f947a66a75377906631e143c4cbe7f9edd6c&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/7gs9nn5zuhs81.png?width=247&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=b551f947a66a75377906631e143c4cbe7f9edd6c&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the app I used the direct link to check my ticket on chain in the NFT ticket explorer. When I click “transaction” (next to sold for). It links to the onchain transaction on polygon.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;NFT ticket Explorer on Polygon&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Below is the link to the NFT ticket explorer &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://explorer.get-protocol.io/ticket/967740&quot;&amp;gt;https://explorer.get-protocol.io/ticket/967740&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/x2vgo582vhs81.png?width=620&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=84ee057098c5e9bad3965404e63456d34b0a2daf&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/x2vgo582vhs81.png?width=620&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=84ee057098c5e9bad3965404e63456d34b0a2daf&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;NFT ticket on Opensea&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The ticket I purchased will only be claimable as an NFT after my ticket is scanned and the event has passed (to prevent people from buying tickets just for NFT, resulting in empty seats in the stadium). Event organizers van rewards fans with NFTs of memorizing moments of the event to increase the fan engagement.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here is an example of an NFT ticket on OpenSea. The ticket is Caprices festival, which is ticketed by XTIX (another ticketing company that uses the GET protocol whitelabel)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/85zvgqb5vhs81.png?width=449&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=0b68a85be5167639f9b3f6db1ef0f6a630179a50&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/85zvgqb5vhs81.png?width=449&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=0b68a85be5167639f9b3f6db1ef0f6a630179a50&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://opensea.io/assets/matic/0x2055244a719229d669488e389388f2d653a452f4/605584&quot;&amp;gt;https://opensea.io/assets/matic/0x2055244a719229d669488e389388f2d653a452f4/605584&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Selling the ticket again&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Since I cannot go to the event on this date. I put up the ticket for sale on the secondary market place in the app. The maximum price I can sell the ticket for is my original purchasing price. Both the seller and the buy incur a 5% fee (6.75 Euro). When the ticket is sold, I will receive the my money automatically in bank account.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/7ic2ubd7vhs81.png?width=233&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e11edc3cae16408fe93cb521654239944013acf0&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/7ic2ubd7vhs81.png?width=233&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e11edc3cae16408fe93cb521654239944013acf0&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Conclusion&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The customer experience of buying a NFT ticket is as smooth as using major traditional ticketing companies. Since the blockchain technology is used in the back-end, it did not require any knowledge of crypto/blockchain/NFT. My grandma would be able to buy a NFT ticket. The technology for mass adoption of NFT ticketing is already available. The next step would be for artists and fans to switch to NFT ticketing or demand a better service from existing ticketing companies. Admittedly, this can be hard due to existing monopoly of Ticketmaster in the United States with owning the venues and long term contracts. The influence of Ticketmaster is much less in Europe. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you want to buy a NFT ticket without spending any money. You can use the Demo version&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;GUTS tickets Demo&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://guts.tickets/nl/demo&quot;&amp;gt;https://guts.tickets/nl/demo&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;*final note\&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;*&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I used GUTS ticket, a whitelabel product of GET protocol, to test the consumer experience of NFT ticketing. As far as I am aware this is the only NFT ticketing solution that has already sold a large amount of tickets (1.5m+ atm). There are some other NFT ticketing companies that either are still start ups and not yet selling any tickets. Or companies that like TIXNGO state they use blockchain ticketing without any actual proof. If you are not able to withdraw your NFT to a public blockchain, it defies the reason to use NFT ticketing. It does not provide to same benefits of fan engagement.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Are there any other NFT ticketing solutions I should try?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thanks for your inquiry.   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As stated in Section 12 of our &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kraken.com/legal&quot;&amp;gt;Terms of Service&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, if a Kraken account is inactive for an extended period of time, Kraken may have to take certain actions concerning your account depending on your state of residence, including reporting and/or remitting the assets or the value of the assets to the state as required by state unclaimed property law. To avoid this, we encourage you to routinely sign into your account to keep it active.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Virtually all the places I talked to about this said try to log in once a year. A lot of places in the USA won&amp;amp;#39;t force places like exchanges to say your money and stuff isn&amp;amp;#39;t unclaimed until 3 or so years. But it is best to log in at least 1 time a year so you don&amp;amp;#39;t forget.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Note I highly suggest checking out the rules about escheatment for your local area and how to reclaim the property this policy took from you.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Let&amp;amp;#39;s take a look at it:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Snoop talks about how all music is influenced by labels and all sound the same. The music industry, as you can imagine, is extremely predatory for young artists and even stars. Apparently even Taylor Swift is having problems getting back her master sountracks. He and his son see crypto as a way to give artists back their freedom and creativity without being influenced by big labels. Pretty freakin awesome.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Snoop also talks about using his tracks without worrying about copyrights. With all this Youtube copystriking bullshit stifling content creators, its refreshing to see us going back to the golden days of content creation with crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Yeah, we heard some dope shit. Somebody took one of my vocals from a rap song that I did on the mixtape and made a whole fucking EDM song out of it. That shit banging. So I&amp;amp;#39;m anxious to hear what what, these you know content creators are going to do with my vocals with the music with the songs because once you get it you can do whatever the fuck you want to do with it. That&amp;amp;#39;s what I love about this shit. There&amp;amp;#39;s no rules and regulations you can make it yours. You can flip it, dip it. You know how much it costs to get me on the verse?  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yeah, I know you don&amp;amp;#39;t, but anyway they get it on the House.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/s7hy5l07zgs81.jpg?width=1181&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=9834be925bb1cf4e7a3794cb6ef188e6692d5054&quot;&amp;gt;Trades dashboard&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And here is how you can give the trading bot the logic you want in terms of TA:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/hcvwfq2dzgs81.png?width=486&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=55b50d411519782e0c0d6b9af90dd956913d93bd&quot;&amp;gt;TA customisation&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We&amp;amp;#39;re going to internally test the hell out of this app for the next month or so and then finally release it in closed beta. Just so the app doesn&amp;amp;#39;t crash in the first few minutes of the launch we&amp;amp;#39;re going to restrict the number of closed beta testers to about 50 or so.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Once we&amp;amp;#39;re confident it runs fine (and will have inevitably fixed the bugs that&amp;amp;#39;ll come out of the closed beta) we&amp;amp;#39;ll do an Open Beta followed by a full release.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Basically&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;if someone is born today, we know they are most likely going to live until 80-90 years old.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;We know people are going to want to retire somewhere around 70 because that is the lie that was sold.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;We know health cost sky rocket the older someone gets on average.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;We know the first 20 years of someone&amp;amp;#39;s life they aren&amp;amp;#39;t spending any money or very minimum amount.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;We know between 20-40 years old the person tends to spend money on normal things like beds, kitchen stuff, etc.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;When the person gets in the later years they spend less to $0 on those things because they already have it. And the money moves into big ticket items like that car they always wanted, that trip they always wanted, etc but it tends to be 1 time thing. But outside of that the spending dramatically drops. This is caused by they already have most of what they want + their income dramatically drops. But again the biggest cost is things like healthcare (USA)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/cif5i6pyvbs81.png?width=905&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=c13412273a562b1ba44385f1cdc8fc22658155b7&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/cif5i6pyvbs81.png?width=905&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=c13412273a562b1ba44385f1cdc8fc22658155b7&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Above is a chart from Real Vision, it shows the estimated retirement rate of people in the future. Note this was 2018 when that was made, and I can&amp;amp;#39;t find a more up to date chart.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now if you take a look at the inflation vs recession&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/5pg1xqpzvbs81.png?width=1679&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=0ca4c8a4fd7fe828a679ae281a6749934e8305f2&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/5pg1xqpzvbs81.png?width=1679&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=0ca4c8a4fd7fe828a679ae281a6749934e8305f2&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We just crossed this and it bounced back, so we will see what will happen in the future. But in the past one of the big hits is 2008 time housing bubble collapse.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;See the thing is when someone gets closer to retirement normally they will move their investments into a more stable and less risky market. In reality, 2008 wiped out many people&amp;amp;#39;s retirement and many people are still not recovered from what they lost in 2008. This forced people to put their money in higher risky markets (which might include crypto).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Part of this or a lot of this caused things like&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/vcwe21n0wbs81.png?width=1477&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=976da11327998496d649b272aaed03d7aba3a437&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/vcwe21n0wbs81.png?width=1477&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=976da11327998496d649b272aaed03d7aba3a437&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;and what we might of seen in crypto. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Note the dates when the spike happened. Basically, people DCA into markets through their retirement system or for retirement.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What you need to keep in mind is what happens when people retire.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;They stop putting money into their retirement. Most retirement plans will not let you put more money into it after you retired. And even if it allowed it, most never had the know how in doing things, or they just don&amp;amp;#39;t care. But at the end, the DCA into the market stops. So the growth stops.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;They start pulling out, this causes a pull back on the market. Obviously a few doesn&amp;amp;#39;t matter. But as you see from the first chart, the growing number of millions all at once is happening.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So if you have a ton of people stop being buyers, and now becoming sellers. We now have a recipe for a near free falling market. What you most likely going to see is those near retirement or at retirement just retire and pull out as much as they can to save everything. Some (and this is happening today) selling their pensions or pulling out of their IRA early. And what happens is the first people who retire get the most, while everyone else gets screwed in a runaway market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A lot of economist are saying that this next recession is going to be far worse than the great depression era, and it is likely to happen in the next few years. (None of this is financial advice btw)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So what happens is&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/zmneemi1wbs81.png?width=3131&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=b8732310a65fc7638514be7f4725d547b051bcfe&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/zmneemi1wbs81.png?width=3131&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=b8732310a65fc7638514be7f4725d547b051bcfe&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/m8nrasd7wbs81.png?width=3131&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=79f0ee4908c47944bd6a9122514bb561377770df&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/m8nrasd7wbs81.png?width=3131&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=79f0ee4908c47944bd6a9122514bb561377770df&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You have older and older groups going back to work because&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;They are living way longer than they thought and the biggest cost in your life is just living.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;They lost too much in prior bad times&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Inflation cost increase&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Increasing healthcare cost&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;And in the future for my generation it will be student loans&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And as you can see, the older workers are now competing with some of the youngest now. Likely it is people who had good jobs ($50k-$100k+) jobs and due to age discrimination they can&amp;amp;#39;t do those jobs anymore. Now they are stuck with starter jobs and min wage. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/teresaghilarducci/2021/12/17/too-many-older-workers-are-stuck-in-low-wage-jobs/?sh=1d1ce8916c15&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/teresaghilarducci/2021/12/17/too-many-older-workers-are-stuck-in-low-wage-jobs/?sh=1d1ce8916c15&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some might say, well younger people will pick up the slack. Well....&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/yrankj98wbs81.png?width=648&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=50ddadb463b6b04fe1ef228f27197ab0e6645ce5&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/yrankj98wbs81.png?width=648&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=50ddadb463b6b04fe1ef228f27197ab0e6645ce5&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So thanks due to bad gov policies and society pushing a bad idea (by force where if you don&amp;amp;#39;t jump then you don&amp;amp;#39;t get to a better life), younger people are stuck with a heavy bill in student loans, increase cost of living, increase taxes and types of taxes&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/n02qd7y8wbs81.png?width=792&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=cdb226bb88bac972e8f902495b4f1f34cfc03002&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/n02qd7y8wbs81.png?width=792&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=cdb226bb88bac972e8f902495b4f1f34cfc03002&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;and a number of things which makes it impossible for the younger generations to support the older.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And then following generations it will be worse since the current generations are having WAY less kids&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/mvye8is9wbs81.png?width=1171&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=4b94b851b7f9304c2ee04b229d3e2409878599a5&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/mvye8is9wbs81.png?width=1171&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=4b94b851b7f9304c2ee04b229d3e2409878599a5&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Oh and top that automation is taken off so current generation and upcoming is screwed there too&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/36op4vjawbs81.png?width=1200&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e1c745c1c28913e6361c464c9106a01665809191&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/36op4vjawbs81.png?width=1200&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e1c745c1c28913e6361c464c9106a01665809191&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;TLDR What does all of this mean?&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In a nut shell it looks like the older generations are about to or are retiring. Since they aren&amp;amp;#39;t adding anything more into the markets, but now selling. This has a &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;strong&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; likely to cause major drops. Because of past economic problems and other things, older generations had to invest into higher risk to high risk things which might include crypto (which means when the retirement really kicks up we might see a pretty big hit). The ones who couldn&amp;amp;#39;t retire or waited get screwed and now they basically can&amp;amp;#39;t retire until they die. But thanks to age discrimination and not being prepared for such factors, the older generations are going to be (and as charts show are) competing with the youngest of the labor force. The increase cost of living and the fact the youngest generations have a growing harder time in getting a time getting a job. And then because automation is lower the workforce in itself by a good amount. It is likely all groups will start pulling out of their investments early to support themselves and those around them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;(Side note: today in a hardware store I overheard a few people talking to each other how they had to sell their pension to help pay for medical bills and other things, and how their retirement is a shotgun or being worked to death.)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The take away from this isn&amp;amp;#39;t a buy or sell. It is we should watch what happens and adapt. There is no data showing how this will play out since in no time in world history has all these factors happened, the gov screwed up so bad and it is still around, and with modern tech it makes it impossible to do illegal stuff to just get by.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What is your thoughts on all of this?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I did a search on the sub, and apparently literally &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;nobody&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; actually read the User Agreement. Posts of people liking the false sense of security of a non-existant &amp;amp;quot;account protection&amp;amp;quot; policy up to 1 million dollars, no trading fees, etc. We&amp;amp;#39;ll get into all that, don&amp;amp;#39;t worry.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;ll be breaking down the three main points they&amp;amp;#39;re selling with this subscription in their advertisement of this &amp;amp;quot;service&amp;amp;quot;, in the order they are being presented, while quoting relevant terms directly from: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coinbase.com/legal/user_agreement/united_states/&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.coinbase.com/legal/user_agreement/united_states/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;1) Zero trading fees - Unlock your portfolio’s potential and trade as much and as often as you want with $0 in trading fees.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Nobody likes fees. What&amp;amp;#39;s the fine print say?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Section 5: Coinbase One&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;1. Coinbase One Subcription.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Eligible Users may sign up for Coinbase One which is an automatically renewing subscription requiring recurring payments.  A Coinbase One subscription grants you the benefits of: (a) a waiver of Coinbase fees for buying, selling, and converting digital currencies on the Coinbase platform (which does not include Coinbase Pro’s order matching platform), provided that a spread in the price is still included in all buys, sells, and conversion of digital currencies on the Coinbase trading platform ...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You read that right? Market buys on Coinbase only. No Coinbase Pro. Market buys only on regular Coinbase. That spread might as well be considered a fee. Things get uglier, just wait.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;2) $1M account protection - Members may be eligible to receive reimbursement for up to $1M in losses caused by unauthorized access.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is the deceit that I felt needed brought  to the forefront the most, as soon as possible. $1M in account protection could sound nice, especially these days with all the phishing, viruses, keyloggers, you name it flying around. Let&amp;amp;#39;s have a closer look at those terms.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Section 5: Coinbase One&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;... and (c) Coinbase Account Protection as detailed in paragraph 3 below. Coinbase may modify or suspend this program at any time upon notice.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Well that&amp;amp;#39;s not a great start, but let&amp;amp;#39;s keep digging.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Section 3: Coinbase Account Protection&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Coinbase Account Protection.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; With an active Coinbase One subscription, you may be eligible to receive a one-time reimbursement for up to $1,000,000 (U.S. Dollars) of actual losses (or the U.S. Dollar equivalent thereof, in the case such losses were in the form of Digital Currency) that you sustain due to a compromise of your Coinbase Account login credentials resulting from a vulnerability or other deficiency in Coinbase’s systems and/or security protocols (the “Coinbase Account Protection”). The Coinbase Account Protection is subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this [Paragraph 3] (the “Coinbase Account Protection Warranty Terms”), which apply in addition to the terms of the Agreement and any other terms and policies set forth on the Coinbase Site.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;3.1.4.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; 2-factor authentication with either an authenticator application (e.g., Duo or Google Authenticator), security key (e.g., Yubikey) or push notification through the Coinbase mobile application must have been enabled on your Coinbase Account at the time you sustained the Reimbursable Losses. 2-factor authentication via SMS is not sufficient to be eligible for coverage under the Coinbase Account Protection.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That seems reasonable, SMS protection is very weak compared to TOTP MFA, a security key, or a security app&amp;amp;#39;s push notifications.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But now let&amp;amp;#39;s get into the ugly and why this account protection isn&amp;amp;#39;t really any protection at all.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;3.2. What is Not Covered.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;3.2.1&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. The Coinbase Account Protection does not cover reimbursement for any loss of funds held outside of your Coinbase Account, including without limitation in Coinbase Custody, Coinbase Wallet, or non-custodial wallets connected to Coinbase Commerce.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;3.2.4.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; The Coinbase Account Protection does not cover reimbursement for any losses that were the result of a security vulnerability or other technical deficiency in your computer, mobile device or security key.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;3.2.5.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; The Coinbase Account Protection does not cover reimbursement for any losses that were the result of an event or action that you were aware could result in compromise of your account security, if you failed to promptly notify Coinbase of such occurrence in accordance with Section 6.2 (Security Breach) of the Agreement.  Examples of such occurrences include, without limitation, if you lose your security key or API key, if you grant a third party remote access to your account, or if you provide your Coinbase Account login credentials and/or 2-factor authentication codes to a third party.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;3.4. Other Terms.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;  In the event of a conflict between these Coinbase Account Protection Warranty Terms and anything else in the Agreement, these Coinbase Account Protection Warranty Terms will govern.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, you are still primarily responsible for ensuring the security of your Coinbase Account, and if you suspect that you have been the victim of a Security Breach, you must notify Coinbase Support as soon as possible in accordance with Section 6.2 of the Agreement.  &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;The Coinbase Account Protection is not an insurance policy.  To the extent you require protection beyond the Coinbase Account Protection, we strongly encourage you to purchase an insurance policy or other protection that provides coverage for unforeseen events that may result in the loss of funds held in your Coinbase Account.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Well now we know we&amp;amp;#39;re where we need to be, when they&amp;amp;#39;re literally suggesting you get an insurance policy, excluding all security vulnerabilities of your devices, and excluding if you provide your credentials and/or MFA to a third party. Use an app to generate TOTP MFA codes? That&amp;amp;#39;s a third party. Use a password manager to generate extremely secure passwords? That&amp;amp;#39;s a third party. Surely they can&amp;amp;#39;t really mean all this, right?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Section 5: Data Protection and Security&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;5.2. Security Breach&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. If you suspect that your Coinbase Account or any of your security details have been compromised or if you become aware of any fraud or attempted fraud or any other security incident (including a cyber-security attack) affecting you and/or Coinbase (collectively a &amp;amp;quot;Security Breach&amp;amp;quot;), you must notify Coinbase Support immediately at &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://help.coinbase.com&quot;&amp;gt;https://help.coinbase.com&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; or (888) 908-7930 and provide accurate and up to date information throughout the duration of the Security Breach. You must take any steps that we reasonably require to reduce or manage any Security Breach. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Prompt reporting of a Security Breach does not guarantee that Coinbase will reimburse you for any losses suffered or be liable to you for any losses suffered as a result of the Security Breach.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;5.3. Computer Viruses.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;We shall not bear any liability, whatsoever, for any damage or interruptions caused by any computer viruses or other malicious code that may affect your computer or other equipment, or any phishing, spoofing or other attack.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; We advise the regular use of a reputable and readily available virus screening and prevention software. You should also be aware that SMS and email services are vulnerable to spoofing and phishing attacks and should use care in reviewing messages purporting to originate from Coinbase. Always log into your Coinbase Account(s) through the Coinbase Site to review any transactions or required actions if you have any uncertainty regarding the authenticity of any communication or notice.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yup, they definitely meant all that. If you get malware of any sort you&amp;amp;#39;re not covered. If you get phished, you&amp;amp;#39;re not covered. Now that we&amp;amp;#39;ve broken this all down, I&amp;amp;#39;m trying to think of a single scenario you might be covered, and all I can come up with is if Coinbase itself experienced a breach.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I don&amp;amp;#39;t even feel like going onto their final advertisement point of 24/7/365 customer support at this point, but that&amp;amp;#39;ll be a quick one.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;3) 24/7 priority support - Your dedicated Coinbase One team is standing by to help at a moment’s notice. Available 24/7/365, including weekends and holidays.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Section 5: Coinbase One&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;... (b) a dedicated customer support line available twenty four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week, three-hundred and sixty five (365) days a year ...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There aren&amp;amp;#39;t much details in the terms on this, but in reviewing other posts in this sub and others, as well as a few blogs - guess what? Your &amp;amp;quot;dedicated customer support line&amp;amp;quot; is a line to a call center rented by Coinbase. The people you&amp;amp;#39;ll talk to don&amp;amp;#39;t even work for Coinbase. So basically, you&amp;amp;#39;ve paid for an answering service like CallRuby. They&amp;amp;#39;ll be happy to read you some scripted responses, take down notes, and pass them along to Coinbase so Coinbase can try to assist you at a later point though.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I know this has been long, but I condensed it as much as I could. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Always read the terms.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; This $30/month subscription service is literally offering you &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;nothing&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, near-everything is excluded in their terms.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They don&amp;amp;#39;t need to accept Bitcoin or crypto, they can accept dollars and thus don&amp;amp;#39;t need to worry about implications of holding crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bye bye 3% fees, charge backs, minimum charges, 2-15 day settlement, etc.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s over. The battle for Medium of Exchange for the 21st century has been fought, and it has been won. GG.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

His sizable business runs on global online payments via legacy rails. We lost regular contact the past year or so but recently we started talking again and bonding over bitcoin. He got spooked by banking and by inflation and has converted 90% of his (significant) fiat wealth to bitcoin. We talk bitcoin a lot now and as a former aeronautical engineer, he gets it. Very interesting to see a guy as successful and intelligent as him make the switch to a bitcoin standard.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As we talked more about bitcoin, I started bringing up the Lightning Network. He had no idea what it was. I texted him and said: “download Muun wallet, go to lightning.store and buy something with satoshi’s from your Muun wallet.” He texted me 4 minutes later and his text just read: “Game over.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is a man who knows and has used legacy / fiat payment systems to build a multi-million dollar online tutorial business. He is very familiar with what exists and it’s limitations. He immediately understood why Lightning is a game changer from one use. I felt it was an extremely promising moment.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;(Yes, before of that I did spend a lot of time reading technical analysis book, reading blog posts, watching YouTube videos, but none of that really matter, it&amp;amp;#39;s mostly just luck.)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The smartest thing I&amp;amp;#39;ve done after making these profit is to quickly lock them into ETH 2.0 validator, so I keep myself away from gambling them away in market, and all my validators generate much more than I need for my monthly expenses.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I thought I&amp;amp;#39;m going to live a happy life after that enjoying all the money without having to work again, but one year later I find myself depressed, became a heavy smoker and drink quite often.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The reason is because I was a guy with big dreams, I wanted to have some achievement that I&amp;amp;#39;m proud to tell my family and friends, not how lucky I made some gambling money, but after getting these money, I&amp;amp;#39;m too afraid to make another move anymore, which made me feel like I&amp;amp;#39;m stuck.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Stuck because I do not have the experience or skills to get a job with rewarding that I feel like worth my time, nor want to work for anything less rewarding, especially when my validator income is like 5x~10x the salary of the job I can get.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And I obviously doesn&amp;amp;#39;t want to give up my wealth or take any more extreme risk with them, I believe I am not the only one feel the same, any thoughts?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;EDIT:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Thanks for all the response, didn&amp;amp;#39;t expect to receive so many replies, I really appreciate anyone who gave their advice, I would be going through one by one to read each of them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I understand that I will have to make some adjustment to my mentality, also happy someone recommended books, I do love to read books to learn different perspective to life.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
