&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Do we expect a reaction to the next halving?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Well at the previous Bitcoin halving (May 11 of 2020), we didn&amp;amp;#39;t notice any significant changes in the case of the price, BTC ended the day slightly lower, but according to some bystanders halving was one of the triggers for the major bull run that started 2 months later.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/8n20qtfnjjz81.png?width=631&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=bd12f5a1558c201db5e7e131f5cda4c5c8025e60&quot;&amp;gt;price reaction to 3 of the halvings we had&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What we do know is that rewards will be halved and prices will therefore have to rise for &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;mining to remain profitable.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Satoshi himself has written in one of his replies that it would make sense for prices to rise.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I wanted to make my own thread of this issue because in the other thread, I did not feel that it compiled enough information in the body of the post to facilitate a healthy discussion of the current situation. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;USDT has lost about 6.6b in market cap since May 11, 2022 (~9% of their market cap). Historically, from what I have seen this has been the biggest drop ever in Tether’s history. So there is good reason to pay attention to it. I am not necessarily saying that a crash is imminent, but it is very alarming.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Historical, along with current data can be found here:
&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/historical-data/&quot;&amp;gt;https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/historical-data/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As we know, Tether is supposed to be backed by 1:1 to the USD by Tether’s reserves. Tether allegedly has fiat, bonds, and other assets to do this (will address this a bit more below). Even though Tether is near its’ peg, the change in market cap shows an overwhelming amount of redemption. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is concerning for a few reasons, for one because the overall market is down. Meaning, the assets in Tether’s reserve also most likely are down as well. I’m not just talking about the crypto market, either. Since we do not have full transparency in Tether’s backing, many have speculated it’s tied to assets like BTC, which is also way down as well. Meaning, their backing “power” may be lower than it was previously and not exactly at 1:1. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As an example, for arguments sake, let’s say that BTC was bought and fully backed the USDT. Their average price for backing was when Bitcoin was at 30k. Now let’s say the market dips, and bitcoin goes to 27k. At the same time, many start redeeming Tether to cash out to fiat out of fear of the market conditions. This means that the backing of Tether is no longer 1:1 and since people are redeeming, Tether would have to sell off its bitcoin reserves for a loss of 10% to cover the redemption. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;From the Cointest competition, we also found out that Tether has also previously lied about their backing: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/22620464/tether-backing-cryptocurrency-stablecoin&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.theverge.com/22620464/tether-backing-cryptocurrency-stablecoin&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; they have also never allowed a public third party audit. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And it was never completely backed by fiat fiat equivalents and treasuries. Instead, it was backed by a mix of fiat and bond equivalents, 50% being Chinese white paper and other unstable assets. It’s closely tied to China’s debt: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://cryptobriefing.com/report-alleges-tether-owns-billions-in-chinese-debt&quot;&amp;gt;https://cryptobriefing.com/report-alleges-tether-owns-billions-in-chinese-debt&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Tl;dr This whole situation is concerning because Tether is supposed to be backed 1:1, but may have potentially have minted more than they have backing for. And due to the magnitude of redemption (that we know from the drastic change in market cap), it’s also causing their backing “power” to be lower and lower due to broader market conditions, such as war, inflation, China lockdowns, etc. Thus also making USDT more unstable.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And I know what most will say, most fiat is exactly the same, however, it doesn’t have nations backing it as a main form of currency and trade. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We have also seen many people on Twitter having a similar sentiment, Daniel Wang, Loopring former CEO and current advisor stated:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Just swapped all my USDT to USDC and DAI.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In addition, the market cap for USDT has sunk another 1b since the time of this post&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The act of dissolving just days before the collapse of UST suggests the intent to eliminate responsibility of the aftermath, which serves as evidence that he knew something was going to happen. On top of it all, Do Kwon&amp;amp;#39;s Terra foundation sent 52,189 Bitcoin to Gemini and 28,205 Bitcoin to Binance, which were intended to serve as reserves to prop up TerraUSD (UST).

The majority of FOMO after all is simply just greed and events like this one should always be a reminder to overcome this feeling.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then there are the people who went all in on memecoins and hype coins and are full blown REKT right now. What did you expect? Its a coin that’s literally backed by &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;hype&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;nothing more.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yet again, events like this bear market should always be a reminded to invest in something that has actual backup.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Look at Ethereum for example. Its down bad but its holding up way better than other coins since it has actual technology and fundamentals. Or even Bitdao. Their price action has been one of the steadiest in the market cause of their massive $2 billion treasury backing them up with hundreds of millions of dollars of stablecoins and ETH.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Let this be a lesson to NEVER invest more than you can afford to lose and focus more on projects with fundamentals and backing rather than hype based coins that will most probably go to zero at the nearest market dip.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Crypto is dominated by software engineers who think they are more knowledgeable than they actually are, especially when it comes to fields like economics and finance that are FAAAAR out of their wheelhouse.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Terra&amp;amp;#39;s failure was a failure of economics more than it was a failure of engineering. Even the best software engineers are only as good as their inputs, and they had shitty inputs. They thought they understood supply and demand. They didn&amp;amp;#39;t. They thought they were coming up with something new. They didn&amp;amp;#39;t.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The whole Terra/Luna &amp;amp;quot;mint and burn&amp;amp;quot; mechanism is also known by another name in TradFi: the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deathspiral.asp&quot;&amp;gt;Death Spiral Bond&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. It is such a bad idea that it is only employed by the most desperate of companies because of how easily it can get out of hand. For an industry where innovation and meritocracy are supposedly valued, you&amp;amp;#39;d think someone with even a sliver of influence would have recognized it for what it was and raised warning bells. But describe Terra&amp;amp;#39;s mechanism to a single TradFi financial advisor or analyst, and they will politely decline your business and laugh at you when you walk out the door.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But if you think Terra is the only major crypto project that is deluding itself with overly optimistic assumptions about how economics works, you&amp;amp;#39;ve got another thing coming.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That should give you an idea of just how &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;incredibly&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; immature this industry really is, how little actual expertise is working on these things, and how much all of it is still in the experimental stage, even so-called &amp;amp;quot;blue chips&amp;amp;quot; like Bitcoin and Ethereum.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Even Satoshi was a terrible economist. He thought Bitcoin would make for a good digital cash, and it ended up turning into something no one wants to spend (&amp;amp;quot;HODL!&amp;amp;quot;) because everyone&amp;amp;#39;s too afraid it&amp;amp;#39;ll moon the next day. That makes it an objectively bad currency. And Bitcoiners are not alone in this. If you&amp;amp;#39;ve ever praised &amp;amp;quot;deflationary tokenomics,&amp;amp;quot; you&amp;amp;#39;re guilty of it, too.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Compounding ALL of that is the fact that the crypto industry &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;as a whole&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; is less than 15 years old. Ethereum is barely seven years old. And DeFi is less than two years old. Even the guys who invented Solidity don&amp;amp;#39;t have a decade&amp;amp;#39;s worth of experience in the language.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m not being anti-crypto, I&amp;amp;#39;m just being realistic. I&amp;amp;#39;m still invested (~10% of my liquid net worth) and still DCAing. But fuuuuck, I can&amp;amp;#39;t wait until this community gets its head out of its own ass about how &amp;amp;quot;innovative&amp;amp;quot; crypto is and how it will eat the TradFi industry, and just focus on building good and functional products instead of turning into moral philosophers about economics and politics.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you lost money with LUNA, that&amp;amp;#39;s on you, honestly. I saw a whole bunch of posts both here and on the luna subreddit that asked the obvious question: &amp;amp;#39;If UST is backed by LUNA, what stops it from dropping if LUNA drops as well?&amp;amp;#39; and being met with nothing but &amp;amp;#39;this is FUD&amp;amp;#39; comments.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And then people here act surprised and sneer at others for saying they saw it coming. &amp;amp;#39;Hindsight is 20/20&amp;amp;#39; they say, except that&amp;amp;#39;s not true in this case. Many, many people were saying this, they just didn&amp;amp;#39;t want to listen.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I have been following actively the crypto market for 6 years now (Since I was 18 y/o). The first time I heard about bitcoin I was a 12y/o kid who had just heard about the deep web and how Bitcoin was used to pay for assassinations and drugs and child porn and so on…
Fast forwad to 2018 I thought about buying but Bitcoin had already hit 17k (euros) and was at the time at 6 or 7k. I thought to myself “It dropped from 17k to 6k, that’s no good, besides, 7k is still too much”. Then it dropped to 3k and 2k and I  kind of lost interest, and now I regret not buying and Hodling at the time. However today I can see why Bitcoin is and will always be the number one cryptocurrency. I bought my first satoshi at 39k, I bought more earlier today at 29k and will continue buying every month and Hodl it for a very long long time.
Thank you for reading.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

What new users don&amp;amp;#39;t understand is that these people HAVE SEEN SOME SHIT.    &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Imagine living through not just the Terra/Luna meltdown but also witnessing Bitconect, The DAO hack, Mt Gox, and hundreds of shitcoins, rug pulls, ponzis, and exchange hacks. Imagine getting burned yourself (perhaps several times) and then watching it constantly happen to new people. Imagine how every four years, right after the Bitcoin halvening, all these new people show up with their &amp;amp;quot;new toys&amp;amp;quot;. (2013 alt coins, 2017 icos, 2021 NFTs) and zero experience and stubbornness and watch as they completely ignore the advice from people who have spent years in this space.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitcoin is just different. There is no leader. There is no premine. There is no changing the finite supply or the economic properties. Its real decentralized money and the reason we even understand the word &amp;amp;quot;blockchain&amp;amp;quot; today.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here&amp;amp;#39;s to all the new Bitcoin maxis that will be born during this crypto winter. May you be toxic af and may you do a better job protecting new retail investors than the SEC ever has.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TL;DR: Take your ALGO off exchanges unless you are actively trading. June 5 is the target &amp;amp;quot;date&amp;amp;quot; of the ALGOrun, but really this an ongoing affair. This is good for decentralization of the ALGO chain.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Not long ago, our brethren in Monero staged the Monerun. It was a fantastic move and we applaud you. Also, we are saddened by the news that you all collectively took a boat trip to celebrate and then all lost your keys in a tragic accident. Truly heartbreaking.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyway, like the folks at XMR, we at ALGO are also concerned about fractional reserve trading. But, even more pressing is the issue of exchanges having too much control in our governance program. They pledge your ALGO, then vote them how they see fit. They pocket the rewards and pass scraps on to you. We are fighting back and taking control.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So far, the effort at an ALGOrun has been confined to our little community over at &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/algorand&quot;&amp;gt;r/algorand&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. In that time, we have nonetheless managed to sack two of Binance&amp;amp;#39;s cold wallets and make them forfeit a total of over 154M ALGO from Governance.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is time to spread the word: #weALGOoffexchanges.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What we are trying to accomplish is a run on the exchanges that forces them to forfeit their governance rewards (return more power to holders) or buy OTC to defend their governance position. So, we are now officially on an ALGOrun. From now until &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;June 5th&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, we are pressing all our folks to go off exchanges unless they are actively trading. We have made a stockpile of memes and educational material. We will force every damn exchange we can to quit governance and return control to the Algonauts.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;So...What is the idea here?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Answer: We try to push exchanges out of governance and/or buy ALGO over the counter (OTC) to cover their position. At least 500M Algos in governance belong to exchanges. That means exchanges are voting on governance proposals how they see fit and pocketing the rewards. People don&amp;amp;#39;t realize they can get the same or WAY better rewards on a private wallet that is pledged in governance and actually be able to make their own choices on how Algorand goes forward.. The exchanges have wagered that many Algonauts will remain ignorant of this fact. It is time to we expose this.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Wait, are you saying this is like a short squeeze?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yes. Wallets that pledge and then vote in governance get rewards. Exchanges are using your Algo to do this. They are voting for you (and it may not be a vote that is in your interest) and then pocketing the rewards. They pass on only a portion of it to you. If we withdraw from the exchanges, they will be faced with two options: (1) forfeit governance rewards, which can be millions of dollars; or (2) go buy ALGOs over the counter and drive the price up.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;But can&amp;amp;#39;t the exchanges just freeze withdraws?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yes they can, and many already have. But just keep up with it and withdraw. In the past two days we&amp;amp;#39;ve sacked 154M ALGO from Binance. They had to halt withdrawals while they recharged their hot wallet. First they forfeited 64M Algos from governance. Then they reopened withdrawals. And then, they had to forfeit another 94M.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Why June 5th?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anniversary of the launch of Algorand main net!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Won&amp;amp;#39;t people just front run June 5th? Should I pull my funds sooner than that?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sure. They might. And, you don&amp;amp;#39;t need to wait to withdraw. This is an ongoing movement. June 5 is just an arbitrary day for peak activity if possible. And this isn&amp;amp;#39;t just about price. It&amp;amp;#39;s about decentralization and ensuring people have the power to vote their own ALGO and receive all the rewards for it, to participate in the ecosystem, etc.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Can&amp;amp;#39;t exchanges just frontrun this event too? Stock up on ALGO to avoid forfeiting governance?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sure. If they want to buy ALGO and drive price up, more power to them. The point is to either make them forfeit governance or to make them buy more ALGO. If we are relentless enough, we can make them do both.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Don&amp;amp;#39;t exchanges do this with other coins too?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yes. I have no idea if those other coins have the same economic incentives for exchanges to try to defend their cold wallet positions. But, if you want to do your own &amp;amp;quot;[coin]Run&amp;amp;quot;, you can feel free to do so. I&amp;amp;#39;ll promote that too. We have made a ton of content that you can crib from. This isn&amp;amp;#39;t a coin vs coin battle. This is a people vs institutions battle. We are all on the same side here.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you are interested in contributing to content or seeing the content we have made so far, we have posted a lot of content over at &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/algorand&quot;&amp;gt;r/algorand&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. I refrain from posting it here for fear of  automod. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;From henceforth, the ALGOrun is officially on.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My opinions on this :&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The proposal assumes that luna and UST still has value.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There doesn’t seem to be any actual fix to the protocol, this is basically just resetting the chain to a more convenient state.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;No mention on how to fix UST. I mean he said to push the fix later, but the counter argument is that the dynamics UST with LUNA is what defines terra, without that terra is just a PoS like avax or Polygon.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;
