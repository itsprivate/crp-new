&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So first off with simple google search of &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;NFT news&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, you&amp;amp;#39;ll see ridiculous numbers floating around here and there.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Konami Sold This Castlevania NFT for $26,538&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Ghozali Everyday: Indonesian man with US$1 million selfies an unlikely NFT star&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;As NFT sales top $4 billion, what&amp;amp;#39;s in store for 2022?&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Gift to Pope Francis Sold as NFT Raises $80,000 for Afghanistan &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;you know it&amp;amp;#39;s profitabble when the church even dabbles in it&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;‘World of Women’ NFTs Are Cracking Crypto’s Boys-Club Image &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;even feministic articles are in the news now&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The way NFTs are being used right now (images, digital representations), I see that many people still like NFTs, at this point I don&amp;amp;#39;t really care anymore. People are profiting (I hope) from it so it&amp;amp;#39;s no wonder every NFT news blows up. Although, right now all of these are purely out of speculations and NFT owners are basically hoping that the next sucker would want to pay more for their &amp;lt;del&amp;gt;trash&amp;lt;/del&amp;gt; stuff. Not only these NFTs have no current use some NFT projects don&amp;amp;#39;t even have a future that can be look forward to, no promises, no roadmaps, nothing, aside from the hopes that the hype kicks in and it blows up in price. Sounds familiar right? Yeah, just like shitcoins/memecoins.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I may get a lot of flack for comparing NFTs and memecoins, but hear me out. Like I said in my first line, I&amp;amp;#39;m not referring to the NFT tech as the same as memecoins, but the sense of it being a gambling space. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With all the news focusing on the gains on NFTs and ridiculous prices it sells for and the risk being completely written off, no wonder more people are gambling in this space, but let&amp;amp;#39;s not forget how majority of people would end up as bag holders. Just be careful if you plan to dabble on these NFT collections/projects. I really would just rather gamble on pokemon cards, honestly.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These NFTs are worse than shitcoins/memecoins gambling. Big name celebrities are in it for the fun &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;or money laundering for fun like some people say&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;, but as retailers this is really a risky &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;investment&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; if you can&amp;amp;#39;t get out on time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also, unlike shitcoins/memecoins, NFT news are literally everywhere they even get mentioned in reputable news website. The exposure to the public mass and non-crypto people is ridiculously high. So more suckers would get sucked in in this blackhole.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I have been in 2 crashes and been DCAing in the dips and thus I am still sitting in gains territory. But most people will sell especially new retail investors. I have heard people saying that they will HODL and just wait. While some optimist believe they can time the market. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I will just continue with my DCAs, staking and HODL. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And whenever we see some nice green gains I might take out my initially investments. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What would you do when it happens?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;According to IRS publication 17, the Internal Revenue Service wants taxpayers to include on their forms “income from illegal activities, such as money from dealing illegal drugs.” Make sure you put that on “Schedule 1 (Form 1040) , line 8z, or on Schedule C (Form 1040) if from your self-employment activity”.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They also requests that “if you steal property, you must report its fair market value,” but only if you don’t “return it to its rightful owner in the same year.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I see these people all the time, and I’m sure you do as well. People who think that once they’ve moved on to using BTC, they’re forever freed of taxes, institutions, the government, and ‘big brother’. Well it doesn’t work that way, and those a little more experienced in crypto will tend to agree.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitcoin was an experiment, it went well but it still has a long way to go. Bitcoin isn’t anonymous, it’s pseudonymous, anyone who can find one address of yours, can track your entire search history. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Something else Bitcoin has to work on, is the largeholder control. A few whales control the majority of the market. Decentralized organizations have already solved this using DAOs. You see when you use a DAO, take BitDAO for example, you don’t have to put your trust in the hands of a few sketchy men. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Instead, you are given the choice of handing your confidence to the entirety of the public. No honest man is in power, and no power is given to an honest man. You can’t trust humans to control your fortunes. You too, should handle a share of the responsibility of the fortunes of yours as well as others, and that’s how DAOs work. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you only trust politicians to rule and soldiers to fight, then don’t be surprised when war is fought by fools and governments are ruled by cowards.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;DOGE is sitting at a whopping $22 billion market cap meaning that any chance at a pump is very thin and other coins like ELON with a much small market cap of $700 million will most probably have a much higher chance at multiple pumps.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The market cap to TVL ratio is still high at 4.5 so I don&amp;amp;#39;t see this downtrend ending anytime soon without any new catalysts. If you compare this to another hyped coin like CRO, which saw a meteoretic rise and who&amp;amp;#39;s price has stabilized since then (especially if you look at the CRO/BTC pair), you can see that LRC is nowhere near a bottom. I could easily see Loopring dropping below $1 again, assuming no significant BTC movements happen.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And yet, all I see on this sub is more threads shilling the coin and doses of hopium about the long term potential? Nobody is seriously discussing price action over the last two months which is a huge concern to me. I&amp;amp;#39;m not arguing that Loopring is a dead project, far from it, but the short term price prospects are very meagre. Everyone should decide what to do for themselves i.e. risk management, but I don&amp;amp;#39;t see any value in bagholding it when there&amp;amp;#39;s no end in sight for the downwards trend.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Don&amp;amp;#39;t get me wrong, I see huge potential in ZK roll ups and in particular LRC for the next five years eventhough I don&amp;amp;#39;t own it myself. In fact, I&amp;amp;#39;m looking for this downtrend to end so I can buy it when it eventually consolidates. Since Loopring is by far the most shilled coin on this sub , I feel bad for the ones that FOMO&amp;amp;#39;d in after the price rise in early November. These people are seeing their gains evaporate like snow in the sun or are suffering big losses. Maybe an announcement by Gamestop at the end of this month or during the next earnings call will stop this downtrend, but I don&amp;amp;#39;t see it stopping anytime soon before that.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;EDIT: To anyone commenting that price doesn&amp;amp;#39;t matter, well it does. Let me put it this way, if LRC is $1.35 and you feel like it will move below $1 in the short term: you should absolutely sell because you can increase your holdings for the long term with 35%&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;EDIT 2: Obviously DCA&amp;amp;#39;ing is also an option when the price drops, I would wait until the price stabilizes though&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;EDIT 3: Since I received the suicide care message from Reddit and multiple threats in my inbox, I will no longer interact with this thread. What a shame that people can&amp;amp;#39;t behave.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Block size increase&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The  bigger the block, the more transactions it can carry. Block size was  recently increased by 8KB to 72KB (a 12.5% increase); further increases  will be applied over time based on ongoing system monitoring and overall  network health.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Pipelining&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Improves block  propagation times by coalescing validation and propagation. The goal is  for blocks to be propagated to at least 95% of peers within five seconds  by reducing the ‘dead time’ between blocks (the block propagation  overhead). This provides the headroom to make more aggressive scaling  changes, such as increasing block size/increasing Plutus parameter limits.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Input Endorsers&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Input endorsers  improve block propagation times and throughput by allowing transactions  to be separated into pre-constructed blocks. This improves the  consistency of block propagation times and allows higher transaction  rates.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Memory /CPU parameters for Plutus&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Memory  usage is more efficient across the chain. Specifically, there are  memory improvements in Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) handling, stake  distribution, live stake distribution and pools, and hash  representation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Plutus script enhancements&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Even more effective usage of the powerful EUTXO model through smart contract optimization, including: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Reference  inputs (CIP-0031)  – Plutus scripts can inspect transaction inputs  without needing to spend them. This means that it is not necessary to  create UTXOs simply to inspect the information held by an input.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Plutus  Datums (CIP-0032) – Datums can be attached directly to outputs instead  of datum hashes. This simplifies how datums are used, as a user can see  the actual datum rather than having to supply the datum that matches the  given hash.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Script sharing (CIP-0033) – Plutus script  references can be associated with transaction outputs, meaning that they  can be recorded on-chain for subsequent reuse. It will not be necessary  to supply a copy of the script with each transaction, hugely reducing  friction for developers. Reusing scripts in multiple transactions  significantly reduces transaction sizes, improving throughput and  reducing script execution costs.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Node enhancements&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Improvements  will help even distribution of stake and reward computations across the  epochs, thus providing greater headroom for block size increases. Also,  memory usage is now more efficient. Memory compaction reduces RSS  footprint, and memory sharing means we need less data instantiated. Node  version 1.3.3, from January 2022, reduces peak load at critical points,  including the epoch boundary.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;On-disk storage&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;By  storing portions of the protocol state on disk, nodes will need to hold  less in memory, meaning that RAM-constrained systems will be able to  run nodes provided they have sufficient storage, and memory will no  longer be a bottleneck on scalability. This will enable significant  growth in the blockchain state.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Off-chain solutions&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Sidechains&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A sidechain is a separate blockchain connected to a main blockchain (the  &amp;amp;#39;main&amp;amp;#39; chain, also known as parent chain), through a two-way mechanism  (the &amp;amp;#39;bridge&amp;amp;#39;) that enables tokens and other digital assets from one  chain to be used in another and results returned to the original chain.  Assets can be moved between chains as needed. One single parent chain  can have multiple interoperable sidechains connected to it, which may  operate in completely different ways. EVM sidechains coming to Cardano  include dcSpark’s Milkomeda and IOG’s Mamba. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Hydra&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Introduces  isomorphic state channels to maximize throughput, minimize latency,  incur low to no costs, and greatly reduce storage requirements. Hydra  provides a more efficient means to process transactions off-chain while  using the main-chain ledger as the secure settlement layer.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Off-chain computing&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Offloading  some of the computation, for example with Asynchronous Contract  Execution (ACE)  can drive greater core network efficiency. Transactions  occur outside of the blockchain itself, yet can offer fast, cheap  transactions via a trust model.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Mithril&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To  achieve greater scalability, you need to address the complexity of  critical operations that depend logarithmically on the number of  participants. Mithril will improve chain synchronization while  maintaining trust. The result? Multi-signature aggregation that is fast  and efficient without compromising security features.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TL;DR: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/ff38dd08-5947-4c52-af32-15c59cdcdcf8/-/format/webp/-/quality/best/-/progressive/yes/&quot;&amp;gt;All this summarized in one pic&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bonus:  Plutus is basically Haskell which is native smart contract language for the Cardano blockchain. Plutus contracts consist of parts that run on the blockchain  (on-chain code) and parts that run on a user’s machine (off-chain or  client code). Both the on-chain and off-chain code are written in Haskell, and Plutus smart contracts are effectively Haskell programs.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Looking at it from the level of the individual, a deflationary form of money is fundamentally a superior form of money to an inflationary currency. The rational move would be to hold such a deflationary form of currency, and to swap into inflationary currencies as needed. Given the possibility, it would be attractive for merchants and invididuals to accept payment directly in this deflationary form of money.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;While a comparison with gold and the flaws of transacting in gold is often made, these flaws no longer need apply. With the advent of crypto, we have the possibility to create a form of money that has the advantages of gold, without the disadvantages of its physicality.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;----------&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I’ve seen this discussion pop up more often recently, so let’s dive in. In short, the argument goes that currencies need to be inflationary so that people are incentivised to spend. A way to see it is to think of inflationary currency as a hot potato — if you don’t do anything with it and keep it in cash, it’s going to decline in value. Therefore, you might as well spend it or invest it. If you know your food is going to be (ever so slightly) more expensive tomorrow, you might as well buy it today.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/jqt6kkb272c81.png?width=602&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=160fc72058667fe9322a18b346ad8f741c98cf86&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/jqt6kkb272c81.png?width=602&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=160fc72058667fe9322a18b346ad8f741c98cf86&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In a deflationary form of money (for example a currency with a fixed supply) this incentive is absent. Because of this, people will hoard their money, rather than spend it or invest it. With no (or less) money being spent, merchants drop prices to try and entice people to spend. With dropping prices, consumers want to wait longer to purchase stuff, because they expect the item they intend to buy will be cheaper again next month, compared to now.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What this has to do with crypto is that people will often make the claim that crypto can be seen as a store of value, rather than a currency. Save your money in a fixed supply asset that you know won’t be debased, spend your inflationary currency. Because of this, crypto won’t be used as money. People will hold (HODL) their crypto that is likely to increase their value, while spending their fiat money that will decrease in value. Because of this, no network effect arises for crypto, it remains just a savings (and speculation) vehicle.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the hope of having represented the argument of those that believe money should be inflationary correctly, I’ll now dive into why I believe this take is in a sense incorrect, and stems from issues with the specific forms of non-inflationary currency we have seen so far rather than a fundamental issue with deflationary forms of money.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Why deflationary money is a superior store of value&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When you have the choice between spending in an asset that is likely to appreciate in value (deflationary) or an asset that is likely to depreciate in value (inflationary) the rational move is to spend in the inflationary asset. You’d prefer to pass on the hot potato. However, as in a typical hot potato game, the receiver would then again prefer to pass on the hot potato as quickly as possible, while preferring to hold a harder form of money.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The bigger question here is not whether an individual prefers to pay in an inflationary or a deflationary currency. Rather, it’s about why anyone would &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;hold&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; the hot potato, when there is the option of passing it on right away. If I’m a merchant receiving US dollars, and I can convert this into a fixed supply form of money right away, that seems like a smarter course of action. If the friction of doing so is low enough, I’d prefer to hold that harder form of money even if I have to convert back into inflationary currency a few days later.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Run this process through to its conclusion and the question becomes: who is holding the hot potato, and why?&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The current answer to this is that the hot potato has some characteristics that make it attractive to use and to hold at least some of it. It tends to be more stable than the fixed supply money. While the hot potato money might fluctuate 2–30% against other currencies on a yearly basis, the fixed supply asset currently might fluctuate that much in a day. As an individual or business who can’t afford to see 30% of their spending power wiped out in a day, such fluctuations are undesirable. There’s also the fact that governments like to be paid in this hot potato money and it’s commonly accepted in most places, which gives hot potato money a great network effect.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;What about people not wanting to spend deflationary currency?&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I believe this argument assumes a flexibility in humans that is at odds with how people live, and that is at odds with what history has shown us.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Look at how much the average person is making, and at how much the average person is spending. Most people are far more preoccupied with paying their rent, mortgage, buying food and other necessities than they are with the value of their money. As a fun thought experiment — say you need a toothbrush. would you postpone buying a toothbrush if you thought it would be 1% cheaper next month?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There are very specific examples we can point to here. Technology (and most things in life) get cheaper over time. Say you were in the market for a television. Specifically, it’s March 29th 2020 and we’re thinking an &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://tweakers.net/pricewatch/1540272/lg-oled55cx6la-zwart.html&quot;&amp;gt;LG OLED55CX6LA&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; would be great to have. It’s top of the market. We check the price, and it turns out it retails at €2099. A bit steep.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We decide to postpone our purchase for three months. On June 29th 2020, it turns out we can already get the TV for €1668! Three months later, on September 29th 2020, it’s €1299. A full year later, we can get this exact same TV for €1098.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/hhlfb2f372c81.png?width=602&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e63ffdb347c51b427ac925bf20e67c7a85a88014&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/hhlfb2f372c81.png?width=602&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e63ffdb347c51b427ac925bf20e67c7a85a88014&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Most people are well aware of this, and know that it holds for televisions, entertainment, computers, fridges, dishwashers, and a plethora of other things. Nearly everything gets cheaper if you keep the quality equal. Yet people do not wait infinitely. They buy what they want to have now, or when they’ve saved up enough money (or even use credit to do so).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is no fluke. A great piece of research on the “&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/files/wp2017-25.pdf&quot;&amp;gt;Rate of Return on Everything, 1870–2015&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;” shows that the real rate of return on government bonds &amp;amp;amp; bills has been positive, taking into account inflation (p17), for most countries in the world. Since the 1980’s it has been on average positive for every country in the world.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/4pvcdf4472c81.png?width=602&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=39df26ee074629812708c7cfbefddc91524bc9b9&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/4pvcdf4472c81.png?width=602&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=39df26ee074629812708c7cfbefddc91524bc9b9&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Data for bank savings accounts are harder to find except for specific countries. When we look at specific countries, bank savings that are insured by a government deposit guarantee tend to offer an even higher interest rate than government bonds &amp;amp;amp; bills.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is commonly stated that people would postpone purchases and investments under a deflationary money system because people’s money would be worth more tomorrow or a year from now. What the above shows is that there is a safe asset that people can already invest into, with small or large amounts, knowing their money will be worth more in a year from now, yet we haven’t seen a deflationary collapse yet. It shows that people can already have “deflation” work in their favor by postponing buying a new TV, or computer, or a myriad of other things, yet we haven’t seen a deflationary collapse yet.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;How could a non-inflationary currency work as currency?&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Earlier in this article I mentioned how inflationary currency can be seen as a hot potato that is constantly passed on. The question turns into who holds the hot potato. An even more important question is &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;why&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, fundamentally, anyone would want to be holding the hot potato.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thinking about it from a fundamental point of view, I would prefer to hold as little as possible in a form of cash that depreciates. In other words, when I receive payment in inflationary currency, I would prefer to exchange it into hard money as quickly as possible. When paying others, I would convert back into inflationary currency as needed, and pay them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However — as this continues and more people think in this way, the step of converting back into inflationary currency makes less sense. If I want to hold my money in a fixed supply currency, and you have a fixed supply currency but are converting to inflationary currency to pay me with, that seems like an inefficient form of exchange.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As a merchant, I would gladly take your fixed supply currency, and could let you know that I accept this fixed supply currency for payment. It saves you the hassle of converting fixed supply into inflationary currency, it saves me the hassle of having to swap that inflationary currency back into fixed supply currency.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Full efficiency is gained when we have a form of money that is both a fantastic store of value and a fantastic currency. The two strengthen each other — so why have we not seen this so far?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;The gold standard and its flaws&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At this point you’re probably wondering why I haven’t touched upon the gold standard yet. It’s an example of a relatively fixed supply currency. Yet as we broadly observe, it is not in use today, while gold does serve as a store of value. Why is that?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Many economies have had a direct gold-based exchange system at times. Gold (and silver) coins were widely circulated — the Roman aureus was a gold coin, later replaced by the Byzantine solidus. Italian denari, Spanish dineros and the Florentine florin are well-known examples.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These currencies were used within countries and internationally. Gold is a base layer asset, the value is in the physical gold itself. Because of this, no trust was needed when transacting. A country having a debt settled by another country preferred this to be done in gold, because once paid it was fully settled. There was no debt claim, no need to trust the counterparty beyond the simple exchange.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However, carrying around gold is inconvenient at best. Amongst other issues gold is heavy and can be stolen. To solve this issue, credible parties (which we today think of as banks) offered to store gold in a secure place, giving a paper claim to the deposited gold in exchange. As long as the credible party was credible enough, this paper claim was “as good as gold”, while being far easier to transport, protect and use.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However, this also allows banks to lend out this gold to others, in exchange for interest. As long as not everyone comes by at the same time to retrieve their gold, this would work fine, and provides some income for the bank.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the interest of keeping this short, Ray Dalio’s “Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order: Why Nations Succeed and Fail” is a fantastic read. It goes into the next stages of such a system and why we see ebbs and flows in hard money and fiat money.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The important part for this analysis is why we’ve repeatedly seen the move from using gold as a pure medium of exchange to claims on gold and ultimately fiat. It’s not because gold’s (relatively) fixed supply fundamentally makes it unsound to transact with. It is gold’s other characteristics, such as limited portability/transferability and divisibility, and its security costs, that mean it is not ideal for use as a medium of exchange.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Gold is heavy to carry around. It’s expensive to transfer large sums, because the risk of it being stolen increases, so you would need to pay for security. It’s hard to divide it down to small amounts — try paying a few cents in gold. Conversely, try paying very large amounts in gold to someone far away. The transport costs would be large.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Fixing these flaws&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Say we were able to create an asset that had a demonstrably and unchangeably fixed supply, while fixing the flaws with gold. This asset could be carried anywhere easily, and you would be able to transfer 2 cents as easily as you were able to transfer 2 billion. Such a transfer would be confirmed instantly, while the transaction would not cost you any fees. As in gold, it would be paramount that such a transfer happen trustlessly, and that there is no way for people to spend money they do not have.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The idea behind cryptocurrency is largely to offer such a form of money. This is one of the reasons a lot of money is flowing into crypto, and that many people are so enthusiastic about it. Bitcoin was a first version of this, but has some flaws. As an example, transferring Bitcoin is not instant, and it costs a fair bit. It’s not extremely divisible, and most importantly does not ensure security.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitcoin’s security comes from decentralization, from many miners competing for the rewards that come with mining Bitcoin. At the same time, mining Bitcoin comes with economies of scale due to the way Bitcoin is designed. In other words, Bitcoin is designed to encourage centralization and loss of security over time. For more info, see &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://senatus.substack.com/p/why-99-of-cryptocurrencies-centralize&quot;&amp;gt;“&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Why 99% of cryptocurrencies centralize over time”&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That does not mean crypto as a whole has failed at this. Nano is a cryptocurrency that offers instant transfers at zero fees, from anywhere in the world to anywhere. It is a fixed supply, and almost limitlessly divisible (up to 30 decimals). As opposed to Bitcoin, Nano does not centralize over time, instead decentralizing ever further.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the interest of not making this article even longer, I would link to “&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://senatus.substack.com/p/why-nano-is-the-ultimate-store-of-value-and-reserve-currency-3b0318844bc8&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;crypto as a store of value&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;”&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://senatus.substack.com/p/on-crypto-as-a-store-of-value-bitcoins&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;“the long-term future of crypto”&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; for those interested in the ways that certain cryptocurrencies have solved these issues.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Conclusion&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Looking at it from the level of the individual, a deflationary form of money is fundamentally a superior form of money to an inflationary currency. The rational move would be to hold such a deflationary form of currency, and to swap into inflationary currencies as needed. Given the possibility, it would be attractive for merchants and invididuals to accept payment directly in this deflationary form of money.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While a comparison with gold and the flaws of transacting in gold is often made, these flaws no longer need apply. With the advent of crypto, we have the possibility to create a form of money that has the advantages of gold, without the disadvantages of its physicality.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;If this article interests you, I would first and foremost recommend the article&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://senatus.substack.com/p/on-crypto-as-a-store-of-value-bitcoins&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;“On crypto as a store of value, Bitcoin’s incentives, and the long-term future of crypto”&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;. I would also recommend this analysis of&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://senatus.substack.com/p/creating-the-theoretical-best-possible&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;“The theoretical best form of money”&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Mostly, I would love to hear comments and feedback. I’ve written this down to improve my own thinking, and am open to hearing where this is plain wrong or where my thinking could be improved.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

But after journeying in Defi for over a year, I&amp;amp;#39;ve learned that the West is only &amp;amp;#39;wild&amp;amp;#39; for the cowboys and mercenaries—they are known as &amp;amp;#39;degens&amp;amp;#39; around these parts. For this post, I&amp;amp;#39;ll provide ways for you to prosper in the Wild West as a steady and humble farmer.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: Forgot to mention that this guide prioritizes security over profits. The rules of the low-risk strategies are to (1) hold &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;pristine assets&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; like BTC and ETH, (2) avoid impermanent loss and splitting assets as you would by directly being in a LP position, (3) use reputable dapps, (4) use simple strategies (no leverage, no auto-compounding, etc.). &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Ethereum - Very high gas fees&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Wallet - &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://metamask.io/&quot;&amp;gt;Metamask&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; or &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live&quot;&amp;gt;Ledger&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;   |   Dex - &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://defillama.com/protocol/uniswap&quot;&amp;gt;Uniswap&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; or &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://defillama.com/protocol/sushiswap&quot;&amp;gt;SushiSwap&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; are both good&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t recommend Defi on Ethereum due to high fees and because the roadmap is to &amp;lt;del&amp;gt;stop using Ethereum for general purposes&amp;lt;/del&amp;gt; migrate to layer 2s; but, there are protocols that are only the Ethereum network right now. When using Ethereum, I recommend using as few dapps as possible to avoid gas fees.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The simplest Ethereum Defi strategy is to deposit ETH into Tokemak.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; The expected yield is 8-12%. Using &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://defillama.com/protocol/tokemak&quot;&amp;gt;Tokemak&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, you&amp;amp;#39;ll be a single-token liquidity provider. This allows you to avoid impermanent loss (IL) and you can hold 100% of ETH instead of splitting your assets like a typical liquidity provider.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But the IL doesn&amp;amp;#39;t just disappear. There are other type of users that work as &amp;amp;quot;managers&amp;amp;quot; who play a role in deciding how the protocols makes profits. I won&amp;amp;#39;t dive deeper into this aspect since it&amp;amp;#39;s a different strategy but for those interested to learn more, here&amp;amp;#39;s an &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMZ_fS1uZaU&quot;&amp;gt;explanation&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Downsides: Expect to spend heavily on fees (~$200) on bridging to Ethereum as well as approving and depositing ETH. And the same amount for the withdrawing process. If the fees are peanuts to you, feel free to use this strategy, Mr/Mrs. Whale. You&amp;amp;#39;ll be earning rewards via the protocol token, TOKE, as rewards, which may not be ideal given that TOKE does suffer from high price volatility and selling pressure.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Polygon - Negligible fees (~$0.02)&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Wallet - &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://metamask.io/&quot;&amp;gt;Metamask&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; or &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live&quot;&amp;gt;Ledger&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;   |   Dex - &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://defillama.com/protocol/quickswap&quot;&amp;gt;QuickSwap&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://defillama.com/protocol/uniswap&quot;&amp;gt;Uniswap&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, or &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://defillama.com/protocol/sushiswap&quot;&amp;gt;SushiSwap&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Polygon really made its strides between April to July 2021 when they launched a $40M &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://cryptobriefing.com/polygon-launches-40m-liquidity-mining-program-with-aave/&quot;&amp;gt;incentive program&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and since they&amp;amp;#39;ve been reliable and competitive. And with Polygon fees being so low, you’re pretty much free to do whatever.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;In terms of low-risk Defi investing, an Aave + Curve strategy is currently the golden standard.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Adding the rates for lending and providing liquidity and subtracting it from the costs of borrowing, the expected yield is 4-6%. This can be done by depositing into &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://defillama.com/protocol/aave&quot;&amp;gt;Aave&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, using the deposits as collateral to borrow a stablecoin, and using the borrowed stablecoins to provide liquidity in Curve.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As a low-risk user, the ideal borrowing rate is 30% of your deposits (ie. deposit $1K, borrow $300). At this rate, you&amp;amp;#39;ll be liquidated if your deposits depreciate more than 45%. Given that it historically takes several days or cryptos like BTC or ETH to crash, giving you a long enough timeframe to manage your risks. You can further mitigate liquidation risks are to deposit stablecoins, which improves the stability of your portfolio, while depositing even more volatile assets like MATIC will increase risks. It&amp;amp;#39;s all about risk management.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Downsides: Borrowing and lending on Aave exposes you to liquidation risk and will require you to properly manage your assets. You will &amp;amp;quot;be your own bank&amp;amp;quot; and that isn&amp;amp;#39;t easy. Alas, this is one of the few ways to participate while holding assets like BTC and ETH and avoiding liquidity providing risks. You&amp;amp;#39;ll be earning rewards in wrapped MATIC and some rewards in CRV (a protocol token but has good fundamentals and has held its value historically).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Terra - Relatively high fees (~$1)&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Wallet - &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://station.terra.money/&quot;&amp;gt;Terrastation&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;   |   Dex - &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://defillama.com/protocol/terraswap&quot;&amp;gt;TerraSwap&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; or &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://defillama.com/protocol/astroport&quot;&amp;gt;AstroPort&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Terra is flag-shipped by the successes of Anchor Protocol and their stablecoin ecosystem that has a presence among most major defi networks thanks to the Cosmos network. But the option in Terra network itself are limited. I would only recommend using Terra if you want exposure to LUNA or if you&amp;amp;#39;re in need of a Defi savings account. But I would consider exposure to LUNA as having medium to high risks, which is beyond the scope of this post.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;For low-risk Defi participation, I can only recommend depositing UST in Anchor&amp;amp;#39;s Saving Protocol.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; The expected yield is 19% annual percentage yield. By using &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://defillama.com/protocol/anchor&quot;&amp;gt;Anchor&amp;amp;#39;s&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; savings protocol, you&amp;amp;#39;ll be reward from the protocol&amp;amp;#39;s revenue streams from (1) borrowing interest and (2) staking deposits. This revenue comes from another feature in Anchor that allows users to deposit LUNA or ETH and borrow UST, the native algorithmic stablecoin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can further optimize your yield via strategies like using your deposit as collateral for other protocols, but again those are medium to high risk strategies that go beyond the scope.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Downsides: A ~19% savings account is an undoubtedly insane yield granted traditional banks can barely offer 1% for a similar product. But this isn&amp;amp;#39;t too far fetched given that Defi flips the model and instead of getting 20% of the revenue while banks get 80%, Defi users get 100%. The risks are explained thoroughly &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://cryptorisks.substack.com/p/ust-december-2021&quot;&amp;gt;here&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. The ones that stand out are de-pegging, regulatory risk, and lowered yield as a result of &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://cryptorisks.substack.com/p/on-abracadabra-degenbox-strategies&quot;&amp;gt;decreasing protocol revenue&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.  You&amp;amp;#39;ll be earning rewards in UST.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Avalanche -  Low fees ($0.3) but can high (&amp;amp;gt;$5) when congested&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Wallet - &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://metamask.io/&quot;&amp;gt;Metamask&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;   |   Dex - &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://defillama.com/protocol/trader-joe&quot;&amp;gt;TraderJoe&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; or &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://defillama.com/protocol/sushiswap&quot;&amp;gt;SushiSwap&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A lot of big Defi players such as Aave, Curve, and Abracadabra also built on Avalanche, which is why it was able to rapidly grow when it first launched. That and it&amp;amp;#39;s $180M &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/avalancheavax/avalanche-foundation-announces-180m-defi-incentive-program-d320fdfafff7&quot;&amp;gt;incentive program&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, which dwarfed Polygon&amp;amp;#39;s incentive program.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;With Avalanche, you could do the same Aave + Curve strategy and get a similar yield.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; But, unlike Polygon (&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.abracadabra.money/t/aip-3-deploy-abracadabra-money-on-polygon-pos/864&quot;&amp;gt;at least not yet&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;), Avalanche has Abracadabra, which is a reputable dapp that&amp;amp;#39;s also built on Ethereum. So an &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;alternative low-risk strategy would be to use AAVE + Abracadabra.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; The expected yield is 4-6%. You&amp;amp;#39;ll be borrowing and lending on &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://defillama.com/protocol/aave&quot;&amp;gt;Aave&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and providing liquidity on &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://defillama.com/protocol/curve&quot;&amp;gt;Curve&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; or &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://defillama.com/protocol/abracadabra&quot;&amp;gt;Abracadabra&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Under the hood, you&amp;amp;#39;re using Curve to provide liquidity for stablecoins that includes its algorithmic stablecoin, Magic Internet Money (MIM). The revenue comes from a liquidity fee that traders pay to swap between these stablecoins pairs. Again, you don&amp;amp;#39;t need to know any more about the protocol but you can read more about it &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/abracadabra-money/abracadabra-spell-and-magic-internet-money-a563637ce92e&quot;&amp;gt;here&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Downsides: Again, you&amp;amp;#39;re borrowing and lending, which makes you vulnerable to liquidation risks if you&amp;amp;#39;re mismanaging your assets. By using Abracadabra, which works on top of Curve, you&amp;amp;#39;re increasing your exposure to the smart contracts of three protocols. In Aave, you&amp;amp;#39;ll be earning rewards in wrapped AVAX and, in Abracadabra, in the protocol token, SPELL (likewise to TOKE, protocol tokens are not as ideal to hold as network tokens).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;---&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;ll end this post with these four networks that I believe present the best opportunities at a low-risk based on factors that include total value locked and history among others. This also isn&amp;amp;#39;t a list to rank Defi ecosystems, I think each have their own benefits, opportunities, and risks. I know there are other promising networks out there with equally good, if not better opportunities. I&amp;amp;#39;ll be making a follow-up posts on them. But for now, thanks to anyone who read up to this point!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Currently there are several active airdrops on the site, thousands of daily users and a community that grows day by day hand in hand with the growth of the code and the tools I offer that I am developing in my spare time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Why and how?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While it started as a way to expand the algorand ecosystem and as a way to learn more about blockchain development, especially in regards to Algorand, I am increasingly excited about the project&amp;amp;#39;s growth, and I look forward to its future as long as I keep working as I do now.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On the monetary side my only &amp;amp;quot;income&amp;amp;quot;, if I can call it that because between servers and the coins I buy to give away I&amp;amp;#39;m still in the red, are the Ads and a small fee paid by token creators to publish theirs on their platform. For users who enter the site to receive an airdrop, they don&amp;amp;#39;t need anything more than to leave the public address of their Algorand wallet, which they can create for free by downloading the corresponding application on their smartphones.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I welcome all of you to visit the site, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://algodrops.org&quot;&amp;gt;algodrops.org&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;\&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;There are some limitations imposed by the Algorand network, not by me:) &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;You must have a minimum amount of Algorand in your wallet to receive an Airdrop&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;You must opt-in to each asset before you can receive it for the first time.&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

Still, that&amp;amp;#39;s a shitload. No wonder some of my non crypto friends think crypto is simply a penny stock market. Those of us in the space know some project have very good intentions and fail.  Some succeed. Some just hang out. But so many others are pure scam and we all know it. I guess that is the price of decentralization and I sometimes struggle with this. We don&amp;amp;#39;t believe in censorship so why would we be in the business of telling new projects they aren&amp;amp;#39;t allowed because we are already too many in the room.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sadly too many people will invest their life in dumb things like squid game tokens only to find no liquidity when trying to cash out. Others will simply be rug pulled. The worse part is the hit we as investors and believers of fundamentals take as it creates a bad reputation and gives crypto a terrible image. If politicians and regulators should have a beef with anything about crypto its these shady scam projects but how to determine a shady scam project until it is officially a scam. Many people in the crypto world still say Shib for example is a scam and that&amp;amp;#39;s their opinion. Many people not in crypto say Bitcoin is a scam. Many bitcoiners say ethereum is a scam and so on.  So where do we go from here? One critique politicians often use is crypto can&amp;amp;#39;t police itself when it comes to these scams and rug pulls so they need harsh and strict regulation to be enforced and penalized.  How can crypto police itself when project tribes can&amp;amp;#39;t stand each other and all they do is throw each other trash on twitter. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My hope is that in time as more and more people come in there are better educational tools for noobs to be aware of what is a fire hazard but I am not optimistic. People will do what they want to do in hopes of hitting a moon shot and some shady scammers know this so I imagine that number I typed in the title will likely reach 20,000 or 25,0000 by the time 2022 is over.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In 2021, they funded a hit piece that claims energy prices for consumers in New York has increased by $6 per month because of mining. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Surely its not the soaring costs of natural gas that is driving up electricity prices, but mining? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/iprxvhfj5xb81.jpg?width=2610&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e4da2516b82eb585706d4d1af417320b5b82889e&quot;&amp;gt;Since June 2020, Natural gas prices have gone up by 350&amp;amp;#37; in the USA (Henry Hub natural gas futures rolling contracts)&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/v2gl6rmx3xb81.jpg?width=3094&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=9dae03fee6dfbbfaf58df82519db809462d01254&quot;&amp;gt;Not just in USA, in UK, natural gas is at decadal highs. &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Surely, electricity prices that consumers pay have nothing whatsoever to do with inflation, or soaring gas prices that are in decadal highs.. but is due to bitcoin mining?!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crude oil WTI futures are currently at 84, for comparison it was around 56 in Nov 2019 (pre pandemic). The last time WTI was above 80 was all the way back in 2014. Increasing crude oil natural gas prices, along with inflation that is at multi-decade high is not the reason for increase in household electricity, but its bitcoin mining that is responsible.. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/a4z5aqnyaxb81.jpg?width=1944&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=6656489541bece07a0e9b83837d42345157f987c&quot;&amp;gt;Thats according to this study funded by Ripple in collusion with the Department of Treasury. &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;... The same Department of Treasury headed by another well known Bitcoin hater Janet Yellen, who earned $7m as &amp;amp;quot;speaking fee&amp;amp;quot; from the same banks she is supposed to regulate but has tried to stifle Bitcoin and crypto at every opportunity. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Research with &amp;amp;quot;financial support&amp;amp;quot; is nothing but propaganda, especially when it&amp;amp;#39;s funded by a competitor to bitcoin that lobbies with the government. Ripple continues to be a centralised premine scam created to enrich its founders. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Ripple has also cozied up with the likes of WEF, the very organisations Bitcoin was created as a fuck you to. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.weforum.org/organizations/ripple&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.weforum.org/organizations/ripple&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As its price and narrative around the shitcoin has stagnated, Ripple is resorting to dirty political tricks to get a leg up. As usual, they will fail. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The narrative that bitcoin mining companies cause increase in electricity bills in NY is rubbish, as the largest BTC mining companies in New York produce their own energy. Infact the last one to start mining in NY is a hydro electric plant that was unused for years, before they started mining Bitcoin last year. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Mechanicville-hydro-plant-gets-new-life-16299115.php&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Mechanicville-hydro-plant-gets-new-life-16299115.php&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The other large mining company Greenidge Generation also produces its own energy.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: Buttcoin losers in comments say &amp;amp;quot;reee bitcoin move to POS or govt will ban it&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yeah not too bright, the whole point of Bitcoin is that it cant be banned unlike the proof of stake shitcoins you support that can be created out of thin air at the press of a button and shut down at the press of a button.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Another one who is literally a war monger calling for Ukraine invasion but pretends to care about global e-waste. Lmao. Bitcoin haters are really a funny bunch&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some of you may have seen my previous posts, where I open source entire projects and share them with the community if I feel like they could add value to you guys. I like doing it and it makes feel good that you guys appreciate the content so much.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Because everything that I build is open source and available for everyone, the only way that I&amp;amp;#39;ve been able to monetise my passion is by becoming a YouTube partner, and monetising my videos.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I don&amp;amp;#39;t make a huge amount, but enough to keep me hopeful that one day, it will grow and actually make a difference.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here&amp;amp;#39;s a video I just made explaining the whole thing in more detail. I&amp;amp;#39;m also using that video to raise awareness against the corrupted mess that is YouTube so if you feel like helping, feel free to show this video to other people who might not understand just how destructive these corporations are for the freedom of our Internet: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/VRJXvJnUWV8&quot;&amp;gt;https://youtu.be/VRJXvJnUWV8&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;ve recently received an e-mail from Google telling me that my Adsense account has been cancelled. For those that don&amp;amp;#39;t know, without an adsense account, you can&amp;amp;#39;t get paid by YouTube.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They haven&amp;amp;#39;t sent a warning, started in investigation, or asked me anything prior to that.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is literally all the information that they have given me:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/sba6q2jv3xb81.png?width=629&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=882822e4b75bd9d9ec128a6bb63f393a91c916ce&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/sba6q2jv3xb81.png?width=629&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=882822e4b75bd9d9ec128a6bb63f393a91c916ce&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I have appealed this decision, and got back a dry response, saying that my adsense account will not be re-instated.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I know I&amp;amp;#39;m not the first, and sadly won&amp;amp;#39;t be the last crypto YouTuber to be cancelled by google without any prior explanation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;ve spent hours reading their terms and conditions, and it doesn&amp;amp;#39;t seem that Google was ever in the right with this, making this a breach of contract.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I was always for the idea of a decentralised internet and social media, but I never realised before how much we need it, and how valuable freedom and justice truly are as given by the blockchain and decentralisation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I hope that my experience has given you the extra fuel you needed to want to search for alternative decentralised solutions in favour of the established tech giants who don&amp;amp;#39;t care about anything but their own obscene profits.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;EDIT:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;For those wanting to see proof of demonetisation and that there is no invalid traffic coming into my youtube channel:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

It shows what this sub is - not an advocate for cryptocurrency, but a thinly veiled place to be tribal and act salty when other people’s bags do well.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That’s pathetic.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is a win for cryptocurrency in general. I’ve been around this space since 2013. Back then, Bitcoiners were screaming for companies to accept cryptocurrency and price things in cryptocurrency. Then when it happens 8 years later, the primary attitude about it is salt just because the cryptocurrency of choice isn’t in the bag of certain people in the sub.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Grow up, take a step back, and recognize this as a win for cryptocurrency. We are in this together.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If it was your cryptocurrency of preference being accepted, you’d magically consider it a good thing. That’s the truth.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;ve always heard of the movie &amp;amp;#39;the big short&amp;amp;#39; but never watched it before. I was shocked at what went down and how totally ignorant people, banks, hedge funds etc were to giving loans or investing in loans without having any liquidity behind it. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For me the most mind blowing fact is that only 1 guy went to jail, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;1 GUY!&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. Like always the average Joe ended up paying for all the shit that banks started being so greedy. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Although cryptocurrency is far from perfect it&amp;amp;#39;s a very different approach being (mostly) decentralised and trying to even the playing field for both the rich and the poor. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

That coin that really shot up from, like, $0.15 in November 2017 to $33 two months later? It even was in the top 20 for a bit. Well, I suppose many people on here must have bought close to ATH back then, because they always REALLY wanted it to go there again and talked about their love for it a lot&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Unfortunately it never did. It was hit HARD by the bear market of 2018ff., even went below $0.4. While it did quite well in the bullrun of 2021, it was one of those coins that stayed way below their 2017-2018 ATHs, it got close to $15. Other than most other formerly huge coins that didn&amp;amp;#39;t reach a new ATH this bull run - stuff like XRP, BCH, EOS, NEO, DASH... - which don&amp;amp;#39;t get a lot of love on here, Nano stayed a sub favorite, I don&amp;amp;#39;t think any other coin outside the top 100 (except Moons) is mentioned this often.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Speaking of the top 100: you can see how much this sub loves Nano, if you read &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/og5u6m/its_official_nano_is_no_longer_among_the_top_100/&quot;&amp;gt;this post&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; from last July, when it left the top 100 - OP was at a &amp;amp;quot;loss for words&amp;amp;quot;, how could a coin that was &amp;amp;quot;perfect: Instant. Feeless. Green&amp;amp;quot; not be much higher? Many people agreed, the post has over 5k upvotes. I would argue the post was a bit dramatic - Nano hat only re-entered the top 100 3 months earlier after spending a few weeks below that - but you see how much love there is for the coin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Today, it left the top 200 for the first time since its big explosion in late 2017, as I am writing this it&amp;amp;#39;s 202 on Coingecko, -91% since ATH, the downtrend has been pretty consistent the past few months.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What do you think about Nano? Do you still believe in it, do you think it will break its ATH ever again? Do you think it&amp;amp;#39;s a dead coin that will just continue to go down? Other coins have been declared dead for less but hey, it&amp;amp;#39;s crypto, anything can happen&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Preventing      scams and fake tickets&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;: The blockchain provides a single source of truth for both organisers      and ticket holders. The transfer of NFTs from initial sale to any      subsequent resale is recorded immutably on the blockchain, so all parties      involved can easily verify the authenticity of the ticket. Even cooler, in      cases where resale of tickets is strictly forbidden, NFTs can be      programmed as non-transferrable, so they physically cannot be moved to      another buyer.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Perpetual      revenue:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; As      programmable digital assets NFTs can have built-in rules for resales,      merchandise, content and royalty splits. This means that the organiser can      determine profit sharing percentages for any future resales or downstream      creative content on secondary markets, and reliably receive these funds      knowing they are unalterable within the NFT’s coding.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;New      revenue opportunities:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; NFTs put tickets into the realm of programmable money, opening      up unlimited potential for new revenue opportunities. For example resale      of NFT tickets as &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;collectables,&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; using NFT tickets as a gateway for giving      food and drink deals, even rewarding super fans who have collected a      certain number of event tickets.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Over the past year the NFT tickets have gained more attention in the crypto space. I have compiled extensive list of developers, investors, financial instintutions, ticketing companies and NBA owners that have advocated the benefits of NFT ticketing&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is an “immutable ledger.” Think about it like a book that lives in the sky. Every time something changes, its written down with magic ink, that when dries, never changes. And there are thousands of copies of these books, all getting updated at the same time. If one is ever messed with, the other books would wipe out the problem and replace it with the correct entry.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;(Tedtalk – Blockchain Massively simplified)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mbcg.io/vision?pgid=kn921drf-2058f817-4ebc-4c29-8430-a667933ff044&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.mbcg.io/vision?pgid=kn921drf-2058f817-4ebc-4c29-8430-a667933ff044&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;What is proof of Work?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;First generation crypto currency worked of the concept of Poof of work. There, it is a race to solve a complicated math puzzle, and perform the block write operation. And as a reward get coin. “Mining.” Mining is slow. Bitcoin can only do 7 transactions a minute.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Of the thousands and thousands of machines out there racing to win the next block, only 1 at a time wins. That means the others have literally wasted their energy via compute CPU and GPU cycles. Bitcoin used more energy than Argentina last year.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
But its not all bad. POW is still the oldest and most battle tested consensus algorithm, and many ague more secure because of it. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-work.asp&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-work.asp&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56012952&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56012952&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;What is proof of Stake?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Proof of Stake works on different types of newly developed “Consensus” algorithms. Ouroboros protocol, created by IHOK and Cardano, along with a team of PHDs and mathematicians, is the first of its kind. They created a secure “lottery” consensus mechanism to “elect” the next “slot leader” to write the block. Here each Stake pool can get a chance to be elected by winning the lottery. Each Ada coin represents 1 lottery ticket. When you delegate to the pool, you give that pool your ticket, not your coin. If the pool wins, you get the reward along with everyone in the pool, and the operator. Because there is no more complicated math puzzle, and no more computers racing to solve the puzzle, its much much faster, and much much cheaper. Cardano nodes can be run on Raspberry Pi.. A lot of nodes out there run on Solar energy. It’s so good, Ethereum, who is proof of work currently, is moving to this model as part of their ETH 2.0 migration. Hopefully this summer with the &amp;amp;quot;merge.&amp;amp;quot; In efforts to reduce gas fees and energy concerns. Pokodot created its own Consensus algorithm. Called Grandpa. Tezos has its Emmy+, and the list goes on. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Each other their own way of doing things. But “gen 3” is not Proof of work.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What you should remember is that for both POW, POS, and others, they are all a means of incentivizing the actual people that run the computers hosting the blockchain code. Without them, there is no “decentralized network of immutable ledgers.” Which is because that’s just fancy talk for machines running our code to support the blockchain. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;What is Market Cap and coin supply and why should we care?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Market Capitalization is equal to Price of Coin times Supply of Coin. That is, it. But very important.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;BITCOIN has a fixed supply. It is not all mined yet. Not until 2140. But it does have a finite amount, 21 Million.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here is why you can see a 65K or even 100K bitcoin, but you’ll probably never see a 100 dollar DOGE, or even a 30 Dollar Ada (not soon anyway)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Currently there are  18,929,200 BTC out there at a cost of 43,087.16.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That means, the market cap is 43,087.16 x 18,929,200  = 815,605,469,072 (815B)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cardano, has a fixed coin supply as well. But it is 45 Billion. There are currently 33,526,814,681. So you see the max is 2500x more. Likewise, with 130B DOGE vs 18M BTC - it’s ~6700X more. DogeCoin also makes 10,000 new coins a minute.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At a price is 1.26 that means the market cap for Cardano is 1.26 X 33,526,814,681 = 42,243,786,498.06 (42B)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You’ll need 136B market cap to reach a 1-dollar DOGE in the next year.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;132,670,764,300 + ((10,000*60*24*351) = 137,725,164,300 (Supply of DOGE in 1 year from now)&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
137,725,164,300 * 1 = 137,725,164,300&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You&amp;amp;#39;ll need an almost 1 Trillion Market Cap for Cardano to hit 3032,127,627,594 * 30 = 963,828,827,820&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To give you some reference. Here is the Market cap of some big names.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Visa – 499B&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adobe – 250B&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Amazon – 1.7T&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It’s very confusing because every coin has their own supply. Their own way of creating coins and at what cadence. Some even “burn” coins. So, know what yours does and how it works.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;How can I “get in early?”&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;First. We are all early. You might not have gotten in on the first floor, but we’re only halfway up the stairs to the second flight.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Global wealth is estimated at 1 quadrillion. All the Market Cap in crypto is at 2.05 Trillion. That’s only 0.21% of the world’s wealth.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When looking for “what could be the next big thing” find something with a low market cap, regardless of coin price, that has a strong chance of doing well because of team and tech, the two Ts.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also ask yourself.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What are these coins use cases?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Who is their target audience for adoption?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Who is funding them?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Who is their team building it? What is their history?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Do they have a good plan?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://river.com/learn/how-much-worlds-money-in-bitcoin/#:%7E:text=Global%20wealth%20is%20estimated%20at,represents%200.09%25%20of%20global%20wealth&quot;&amp;gt;https://river.com/learn/how-much-worlds-money-in-bitcoin/#:~:text=Global%20wealth%20is%20estimated%20at,represents%200.09%25%20of%20global%20wealth&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;What are your goals?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto is really split into 4 worlds.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Day traders, H.O.D.L.’ers, Whales, and weak hands.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Day traders realize that this market is very volatile, now, and historically. Good ones, can capitalize on quick gains by buying low and selling high, waiting for a dip, then buying back in, and selling high again, cyclically.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then there are those that “Hold On for Dear Life.” These people tend to find something they really are passionate about, and never sell. They keep buying. If they see their coin dips, below at what they bought it at, and have some extra funds, they buy more, to &amp;amp;quot;Average Down.&amp;amp;quot; Or Dollar cost average (DCA) by buying a set amount on a regular cadence. They only “take profit” buy selling a small portion when price is really high.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Whales, are investors that come in with millions and billions of dollars. They often “test” the market buy either buying or dumping millions and billions in hopes to manipulate the market to their advantage. If you’re reading this, you’re probably not in this category, but you should know they exist and effect this marketplace.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then there are “weak hands.” Do not pick this one. These people buy high and sell low. They only invest based on emotion, and nothing else. When things start going bad, they panic, and sell at a loss. Its much better to let your coin go to .000000001 cents, and just hold on to it in the hopes of a rally years later, then it is to ever sell at a loss. Never do this. Never.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Each has its own risks and rewards.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Day trading can rack up dollars quick, but you can lose them just as quick. And there are tax implicates with trades. Some unknown, and constantly changing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;HODL, might take years, but if you do, the chance of your Return on Invest improves significantly in crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Pick what works best for you but have a plan.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://cryptocurrencyfacts.com/hodling-vs-trading-for-new-cryptocurrency-investors/&quot;&amp;gt;https://cryptocurrencyfacts.com/hodling-vs-trading-for-new-cryptocurrency-investors/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;What are things to look out for?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Do your own research&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. There are now more then 4K types of crypto currencies. You can create your own in about 30 minutes with the right free tools.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The mortality rate of new coins is super high this year. Lots of people trying to do Pump and Dumps.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There is nothing in life that goes up for no reason, if it does, it’s a Ponzi scheme.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;What is the difference between storing on an exchange or in a wallet?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A lot.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;First, you must remember what the dream of crypto is really offering.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Its offering a way for us to break away from banks. Forever.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Centralized banks that can print money, is a problem. Blockchain solves this.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But not if the new bank ends up being Binace or Coinbase. In fact, keeping your coin in exchanges puts us all at risk of market manipulation by them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When a certain 1 person or group owns too many nodes, they can make choices that would benefit them. The attack vector is called a 51% attack or sybil attack.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Today however, you need exchanges to on ramp and off ramp FIAT. FIAT money is government-issued currency that is not backed by a physical commodity, such as gold or silver.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But it will not be like that forever. Chains like ADA and DOT will be interoperable with legacy banks and will eventually cut out exchanges.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Personally, I despise BNB coin and binace. They already take high fees, and now they want the control and the rewards too. Coinbase isn’t much better. Again though, a necessary evil, for now.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But more important than the “dream” is that they can be hacked.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They are a website. Not a blockchain. They hold the keys to your wallet, and let you use them with a weak password and no mfa if you like. Its literally like storing your money in a bank. So know your bank. Good thing, like a bank, SOME, are federally insured up to a certain amount. But some are not, and people have lost millions and billions in the past this way.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Lastly, there is the notification of “passive income” and “interest.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With POS systems, delegators are incentivized to “stake” their coin by earning interest.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With POW systems, like bitcoin, you’d have to stand up your own machine, configure it, and let it use your energy in your house. With withs like Cardano Ada, and ETH 2.0, you can now pull your coin off the exchange, put it in a wallet, delegate to a pool, and earn interest. All while maintaining full control of your coins.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;What are Smart Contracts? (This one will blow your mind if you are a developer)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;First let us start with what most people say.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Which is true for sure. It helps build trust and removes the cumbersome third party “trusted agent” like a bank.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But what smart contracts really are is “ANY Code” that can be written to a blockchain and NEVER be changed, forever.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;ANY CODE. You can write your own coins and put them into the block. It happens a lot.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Games, sure, put in the chain. Check out CryptoKitties.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the future ALL business will be blockchain businesses. Every transaction, every process in the building and distribution, will be written to a magic book that can’t be messed with.. Ever..&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;What are NFTs?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;NonFungible Tokens is metadata attached to an asset. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The metadata is things like who created it, and when. Along with the most important piece the link to the asset. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The asset is what most people think of when they talk about NFTs.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
Its a digital file. Like a jpg or a mov file.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
But its not stored in the blockchain like most assume.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
Instead they are stored, most often, in IPFS storage.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
IPFS is very cool, but its not blockchain, and thus not &amp;amp;quot;immutable.&amp;amp;quot; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So what’s the big deal? I can upload a gif to the internet today.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The big deal is twofold.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;First, you are not uploading anything to the “internet.” That whole thing we call the internet is flawed. Tracked, centralized, monitored, and gated.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What you are doing is creating an EARLY entry, in a book that will never change for the rest of time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Let us sit and think about that for a second.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;De Beers is going to have to get new slogan. “A &amp;lt;del&amp;gt;diamond&amp;lt;/del&amp;gt; NFT is forever”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Right now, it is some awful GIF of a dogecoin. But it is not what it is. It is what it represents.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is the next chapter in Art history. What is created will last longer than the Mona Lisa. Someday you will have blockchain archaeologist that comb though chains.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Plus, taking away the cool factor, they create a place that you can now prove you did it first.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Artist could upload lyrics as an NFT, and later sell them, without the fear their art might be stolen before a contract is in place. People could attach their house deed to a chain, and ever again dispute who owns the land after a conflict.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Besides gaming, NFTs are frequently used to sell a wide range of virtual collectibles, including NBA virtual trading cards, music, digital images, video clips and even virtual real estate in &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://decentraland.org/&quot;&amp;gt;Decentraland&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, a virtual world.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That of course is the rosier outlook on NFTs.   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Unfortunately, in practice there are many gaps today.   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The first I already mentioned. The asset is not stored in the blockchain.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
What that means is that the IPFS provider could &amp;amp;quot;unpin&amp;amp;quot; your asset, and if its not saved anywhere else, you&amp;amp;#39;ll end up with an NFT that has metadata that points to a url that has nothing there.   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The second problem, is that there are thousands of blockchains. People can take your asset, because its publicly pined, and then go create an NFT on another blockchain, and then claim theirs is in fact the original. You&amp;amp;#39;d have to check every chain that supports NFTs to ensure it was in fact the first first.   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Or people have taken hard artwork, like paintings, and then minted and sold them as NFTs. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Terminology?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;HODL = Hold On for Dear Life&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
Hopium  =  Represents the belief that the situation will someday improve.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
FOMO = Fear of Missing Out&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
FUD = Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
Bear/Bearish =  &amp;amp;quot;Bears&amp;amp;quot; believe that an asset, for example a digital currency, will decline in value.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
Bull/Bullish =  If a trader believes that an asset will rise in value, he or she is a &amp;amp;quot;bull.&amp;amp;quot; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If one posts “LUL Solana is so garbage Ethereum never went down” for when Solana went down, but then post “it’s no big deal stuff happens” for when Harmony went down, that’s just desperate hypocritical behavior. Either hold them both accountable for the same problem, or don’t hold either accountable. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It’s easy to pass on circle-jerking sub and shilling random coins on this sub, but this one is just too sad and disgusting to look over imo.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here&amp;amp;#39;s what Tesla &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;will&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; be accepting DOGE for:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) will accept meme-based cryptocurrency dogecoin as payment for its &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;merchandise&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; such as the &amp;amp;quot;Giga Texas&amp;amp;quot; belt buckle and mini models of electric vehicles, Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said in a tweet on Friday.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In other words, you can buy a few Tesla toys and a belt buckle like this one (835 DOGE):&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://shop.tesla.com/product/giga-texas-belt-buckle?sku=1758879-00-A&quot;&amp;gt;https://shop.tesla.com/product/giga-texas-belt-buckle?sku=1758879-00-A&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;DOGE had a predictable and modest 20% gain following the non news &amp;amp;#39;news&amp;amp;#39;, which probably enabled Elon to lighten his bags yet again.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
