&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In that post, I gave a list of about 150 addresses that connected IOHK&amp;amp;#39;s wallet to the billion ADA unstaked wallet involved in the SundaeSwap front-running. Naturally, I was accused of FUD, saying that I made it up and that there was no way someone could track that accurately.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here&amp;amp;#39;s a much shorter path connecting the two wallets.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/i3t2q4djqvj81.png?width=1122&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=7bd324fafb9156a516417439ede1c7e15dd9576f&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/i3t2q4djqvj81.png?width=1122&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=7bd324fafb9156a516417439ede1c7e15dd9576f&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Starting from IOHK&amp;amp;#39;s address &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://cardanoscan.io/transactions?address=DdzFFzCqrhsytyf2oUxqFNXDX9MfAFBWk9pTBXViZbSwxEi7PYcq9LSjBDcW6BVcA7KxgeixYWospQKn68P9PaviM2FvhTFvsEezT8qg&quot;&amp;gt;https://cardanoscan.io/transactions?address=DdzFFzCqrhsytyf2oUxqFNXDX9MfAFBWk9pTBXViZbSwxEi7PYcq9LSjBDcW6BVcA7KxgeixYWospQKn68P9PaviM2FvhTFvsEezT8qg&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, it takes less than 15 steps to go from that wallet to the billion ADA unstaked wallet associated with the SundaeSwap front-running.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can see in the left column the outgoing address along the path, and in the right column, you see the amount of one of the transactions from the prior address to that address. The right column only gives one transaction amount even when there may be others, since it&amp;amp;#39;s only looking at the first page of transactions when going to the transactions page. If there were dozens of transactions outgoing to that address, then the right column only is reporting one of them listed on the first page of transactions. You can see that all but one transaction is on the order of hundreds of millions or billions of ADA. This is not IOHK paying an employee (unless employees are being paid hundreds of millions of ADA!).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To follow along with how to read the table, first go to IOHK&amp;amp;#39;s original wallet &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://cardanoscan.io/transactions?address=DdzFFzCqrhsytyf2oUxqFNXDX9MfAFBWk9pTBXViZbSwxEi7PYcq9LSjBDcW6BVcA7KxgeixYWospQKn68P9PaviM2FvhTFvsEezT8qg&quot;&amp;gt;https://cardanoscan.io/transactions?address=DdzFFzCqrhsytyf2oUxqFNXDX9MfAFBWk9pTBXViZbSwxEi7PYcq9LSjBDcW6BVcA7KxgeixYWospQKn68P9PaviM2FvhTFvsEezT8qg&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. Then find the first outgoing address in the table above and click that link to go to the transactions for that address.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So click on: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://cardanoscan.io/address/DdzFFzCqrht3wEZNURs9U5Qp7HnLoi9Cpao2YzThm88CqvLuP9uTmGzpwQc2e9VSUNGPhR7pAz3g9TtnBx3YoiiJ712Va3dBZNTXkTYT&quot;&amp;gt;https://cardanoscan.io/address/DdzFFzCqrht3wEZNURs9U5Qp7HnLoi9Cpao2YzThm88CqvLuP9uTmGzpwQc2e9VSUNGPhR7pAz3g9TtnBx3YoiiJ712Va3dBZNTXkTYT&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then go to the next outgoing address in the table: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://cardanoscan.io/address/DdzFFzCqrhsrbtzv9G1qXfGq5mKVeF6AWg2TcuS3qjfLyhHgVATsP3PeocKqkraN6VwbZrNvN2iHeCd8iESanCP8FQS6BnyaThGjLNEc&quot;&amp;gt;https://cardanoscan.io/address/DdzFFzCqrhsrbtzv9G1qXfGq5mKVeF6AWg2TcuS3qjfLyhHgVATsP3PeocKqkraN6VwbZrNvN2iHeCd8iESanCP8FQS6BnyaThGjLNEc&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then go to the next outgoing address in the table: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://cardanoscan.io/address/DdzFFzCqrhsnRxkcmJ1ukkN26iefboWFwKLx95G2bW92mutMGqibYJNYuNgbGppCC32tfqWMa8XpWev9jVXoNUQEQPmcDeRh28UJBXvC&quot;&amp;gt;https://cardanoscan.io/address/DdzFFzCqrhsnRxkcmJ1ukkN26iefboWFwKLx95G2bW92mutMGqibYJNYuNgbGppCC32tfqWMa8XpWev9jVXoNUQEQPmcDeRh28UJBXvC&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The rest of the sequence is given below for you to verify yourself:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You don&amp;amp;#39;t need to question whether I made up these transactions or manipulated the Cardano blockchain in some way. These records are immutable and they are available for you to verify, so go verify. I will probably be accused of being a paranoid schizophrenic again, and maybe I am, but who cares! The point of blockchain is that you don&amp;amp;#39;t need to trust me or anyone else. I know some of you reading this will instinctively be defensive and lash out with insults, but I dare you to verify the transactions yourself before downvoting.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Edit:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; What may blow your mind more is what happens when you either Google &amp;amp;quot;Ae2tdPwUPEZ6xYrxCgRDM2NQFM5oajHEoJN3i9ZVV2AbsbvxoJBjVu3yP7W&amp;amp;quot; and go to the cardano.org forum link or Google &amp;amp;quot;Ae2tdPwUPEZ6xYrxCgRDM2NQFM5oajHEoJN3i9ZVV2AbsbvxoJBjVu3yP7W twitter&amp;amp;quot; and click the Twitter link with a tweet of that address.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

And you should never ever take financial advice from the general consensus in this sub. The sub as a whole is wrong so many times per month, yet people keep making the same posts with the same confidence saying &amp;amp;quot;This time BTC is done, the winter is here&amp;amp;quot; ETC.
How many times are you gonna be wrong before you realize it&amp;amp;#39;s impossible to predict where this wild ride is going?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The world is again faced with war, which could signal the next and  possibly final war. This may be the biggest war since WW2, bigger than  any of us, and goes beyond politics or nationality. This is a war at a  time of peace when we are busy dealing with and recovering from the  COVID-19 crisis. People are dying, and the world is guessing whether the  West will join in or watch Ukraine fall to Putin&amp;amp;#39;s ambitions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We  generally do not get involved in politics despite our personal views as  a company. However, this is greater than politics, greater than anyone.  This is a war that may end the world. It certainly is ending the lives  of many innocent people in Eastern Europe. While there is little we can  do, it would be wrong to profit off of it or fund it indirectly. We are  canceling service to all Russian IPs and paying out outstanding  balances.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We apologize to our  Russian miners; many of you do not support the war. However, it is you  who are supporting your nation. Without the people, Russia cannot  operate. It is only through reducing the economic power of its people  that we have a chance of affecting this war. We thank you for your  loyalty, and I hope you understand that we do not make this decision  lightly. Should this situation be resolved peacefully, we will happily  welcome back all Russian miners and use our personal funds to make it up  to you.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you are in Ukraine and  reading this now, know that the world is with you.  We can&amp;amp;#39;t change the  situation ourselves. We call on other companies and people around the  world to join us and make a difference together. This isn&amp;amp;#39;t about  politics; this is about preventing the end of the world and saving  lives. Companies and people need to put the planet over profits in the  modern era. Ukraine has four nuclear power plants. Even ignoring the  chance of WW3, there is a chance of another Chernobyl should one of the  plants be endangered. The Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan happened  despite the plant having been forewarned so that they were shut down and  built to withstand an earthquake. Everyone in Europe, Russia, and the  Middle East are in danger of nuclear fallout should the worst happen.  Notice that the world will only end not because people do something but  because people know yet choose to do nothing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;China&amp;amp;#39;s Supreme Court ruled Thursday that virtual asset transactions constitute &amp;amp;quot;illegal fundraising,&amp;amp;quot; paving the way for judicial prosecution of the crypto industry.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While the People&amp;amp;#39;s Bank of China and a host of other top-level agencies had declared that crypto transactions are illegal fundraising back in September 2021, the court ruling formally designates them as a crime and determines related punishments.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thursday&amp;amp;#39;s ruling said that suspects will be prosecuted under Article 176 of China&amp;amp;#39;s criminal law, which stipulates prison sentences between three and 10 years and fines between RMB 50,000 (US$7,900) and RMB 500,000 ($79,000) for crimes involving large sums of money. Less serious crimes will be prosecuted with under three years of prison and RMB 20,000 ($3,160) to RMB 200,000 ($31,600) in fines, according to the criminal law.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The amendment comes into effect on March 1.
Chinese provincial authorities continue to crack down on the industry. The eastern province of Zhejiang announced increased electricity tariffs on Wednesday for crypto mining, joining Hainan and Inner Mongolia.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s official, Bitcoin is not a good hedge asset. Even when the pandemic first started in March 2020, crypto crashed, exactly like the stock market. If you set aside your bias towards crypto and be smart, you&amp;amp;#39;d buy some PAXG right now. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But the problem is, when did Bitcoin become so coupled with the market?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

ETH falls 10% as a result of a larger market decline. This post on CryptoPotato caught my attention because I&amp;amp;#39;ve been investing in ETH for a few years.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The article said: &amp;amp;quot;ETH broke the support at $2,500. This opens the way for a potential drop towards $2,200, which is the first serious level to halt any further declines. The previous support at $2,500 has turned into resistance, and the market outlook is grim. The US stock market is due to open later today and may pull ETH lower still.&amp;amp;quot;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We&amp;amp;#39;re all already dealing with high gas prices and delayed transactions, and we&amp;amp;#39;re all looking for answers through various platforms, whether it&amp;amp;#39;s Loopring, Metis, or something else, and now we&amp;amp;#39;re facing such a drop that it&amp;amp;#39;s truly a bad scenario. Do you have any concerns about it?  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Another news is that Russian-born Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin blasts Putin for Ukraine invasion as crypto nosedive said: &amp;amp;quot;Ethereum is neutral, but I am not.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
I believe that ETH is neutral but it is inevitable that this whole situation will affect its current value, as it has an impact on the entire crypto market. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I&amp;amp;#39;ve gained quite a few downvotes for commenting this, but I think it is solid advice.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now, another dip has presented itself to us. The same advice holds true, we don&amp;amp;#39;t know if the invasion will get worse, and so don&amp;amp;#39;t invest all your money at once. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here are some of the previous dips:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In November, BTC dipped from $65k to $57k, a 12% dip. If you had lump summed in then, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;you&amp;amp;#39;d be down 39% today.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In December, BTC dipped from $57k to $49k, a 14% dip. If you had lump summed in then, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;you&amp;amp;#39;d be down 29% today.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In January, BTC dipped from $47k to $41k, a 13% dip. If you had lump summed in then, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;you&amp;amp;#39;d be down 15% today.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now, I am not saying that you shouldn&amp;amp;#39;t buy the dip, but do it gradually. Every dip seems like the bottom, but it most likely isn&amp;amp;#39;t, especially with this geopolitical turmoil. Do not spend all your money on this dip, keep a good chunk of money to invest if the market falls further. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Lump summing now could be catching a falling knife - don&amp;amp;#39;t get hurt.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

This is going for a huge mess and the market has fluctuated to dump huge way.
Nobody knows how this will go overtime, and this is my advice that look for market to recover, DO NOT blindly buy into the market right now, save your capital wait for the market to stabilize, it doesn&amp;amp;#39;t matter if you think this is the bottom, this is the bottom, &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;People who have enough money can throw around but this is for those who have limited capital
Stay away from buying in at this moment!
Patience is the key just save it up!
Wait for your moment then go for it!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here are a few questions I would like to ask any Russians on this sub:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;1) What is the overall sentiment toward this invasion in Russia right now?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;2) What percentage of people you know have (or had I guess, based on the legality of it now) crypto in Russia?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;3) Do you think most Russians actually approve of Putin or does he not actually have a 100% approval rating like the Kremlin suggests? Does crypto factor into this for you?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;4) In your opinion, what would the best outcome for Russia be in this situation?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;5) If you could move to any country on the planet (including staying in Russia) where would you go? Would crypto factor into your decision?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I realize you might fear for your lives in answering these questions honestly but I am genuinely curious and if you are brave enough to answer honestly you might get a few moons as a tip.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sounds good right?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But no joke had some amazing timing. Selling 3min before the dumb and making that profit. Oh leverage really is the safest thing ever.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

So that means there is a full scale war now in the country. That also means worldwide economic tensions caused by further supply chain shortages, war effort, and overall volatility from the unknown.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A reminder for crypto new comers who are getting absolutely pantsed and turned around right now. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Selling at a loss historically makes no sense. Overtime crypto and the overall stock market and real estate. It all bounces back.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Time in the market over timing it. Instead of thinking you know what’s gonna happen. Just buy some here and there. And in 2025 maybe we we all be better off for it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All of that being said I’m so sorry if you live in Ukraine I cannot even imagine being a smaller country being brutally attacked by a large and vicious neighbor with no remorse.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fight if you want, escape if you can. Russia kills civilians and supporters of anything western. Just a week ago the US exposed a list of Ukrainians Russians were to kill and put in camps after an invasion.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Please don’t think it cannot happen. Be safe and be smart. Fight hard the Russians are just people.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I started using them about 20 days ago and have been buying around $20 usd of crypto per day to farm their loot boxes, plus around $1500 worth of CRO to hold. There are no fees for the first 30 days so I thought I’d just spread out some buys and see what I get in loot box rewards. So far….like $11 worth of CRO. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In this time I have had three instance where I needed to contact customer service. While it was easy to get in touch with customer service, not one has ever actually fixed the problem. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The first two problems were relatively minor. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I didn’t get the loot box diamonds for a large order I made. I tried to use the support function, still never got them. Honestly, I don’t care that much. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My NFT account and password won’t work. It constantly says my password is incorrect, even though it is 100% correct. I even reset the password, and it still won’t work. I contacted support and we just kept going in loops. It was almost like that scene from Idiocracy where they talk about plants and electrolytes. I wasn’t sure if I wanted to get into NFTs, but I did want to browse. I’ll just not get into NFTs now, no big deal. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The real issue….&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;I spent $500 yesterday for some crypto on the dip. The app glitches out, I get a “transaction cancelled” once the app starts working again, receive no cryto, but I was still charged $500. My banks has confirmed in their system and in Visa that the transaction was approved on their end and the money is at CDC. CDC support is non existent here. They say it isn’t in my transaction history however I sure as hell got charged for it.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While talking to my bank the gentleman I was speaking with said the day before he had the exact same call come in about crypto.com charging people but not delivering the goods. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cdc needs to get their shit together if they are looking for mass adoption to happen through them. I’m assuming I’ll get my $500 back in a few days, but even if I  do I missed an opportunity to buy at a target price because their system isn’t 100% functional. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Maybe they should have spent some of that Matt and Lebron money ensuring their systems work properly.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Automated Translation:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cramming crypto regulation. The European Parliament wants to prohibit the provision of crypto services based on &amp;amp;quot;environmentally unsustainable consensus mechanisms&amp;amp;quot; in its MiCA guidelines. This is according to a final compromise proposal from the responsible Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON), which is available to BTC-ECHO. De facto, this could mean the end for proof-of-work-based cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin from January 1, 2025 in the European Union. The final decision on the draft is to be made in Parliament on February 28.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Stefan Berger told BTC-ECHO that he believes it is &amp;amp;quot;very likely&amp;amp;quot; that the proposal will go through. As Chairman of the ECON Committee, he is largely responsible for the design of the MiCA Directive on the regulation of cryptocurrencies in the European Parliament. The advance of the Bitcoin ban had thereby the SPD, Greens and Left energetically demanded, said the CDU politician in an interview with BTC-ECHO.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The parliamentary groups of the Christian Democrats, right-wing conservatives and liberals would have vehemently resisted the inclusion of the ban in the negotiations. In the end, the Social Democrats, Greens and Left threatened to otherwise withhold their approval of the MiCA draft, according to reports. Previously, SPD politician Joachim Schuster had already publicly called for a bitcoin ban. Green Party European politician Sven Giegold also spoke to BTC-ECHO in favor of illegalization.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The vote next Monday will be followed by a trilogue between the EU Commission, the Parliament and the member states, at the end of which the Commission will be tasked with evaluating the Parliament&amp;amp;#39;s proposal. The decision on this should be expected before the end of this year. In the October 2020 draft, the Commission opposed a bitcoin ban.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitcoin clause is &amp;amp;quot;fatal&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Federal Finance Minister Christian Lindner did not want to comment on the impending bitcoin ban to BTC-ECHO. Frank Schäffler (FDP), member of the Budget Committee of the Bundestag, considers the new proposal of the EU Parliament &amp;amp;quot;fatal&amp;amp;quot;. He already called for changes to the MiCA guidelines last year.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I assume and also expect that the German government and the lead finance minister Christian Lindner will prevent this.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Robert Kopic of the industry association Blockchain for Europe also sees the potential for the clause to &amp;amp;quot;put Europe at a disadvantage.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is a point that would put Europe, along with its green miners, at a disadvantage and would solely lead to them migrating abroad and Europe losing geopolitical access to Bitcoin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The economic disadvantages of a Bitcoin ban are therefore obvious. A fact that the EU Commission will also take into account in its MiCA assessment, says Stefan Berger. What the final decision will ultimately look like is uncertain at this point.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So even if you may think that holding is easy and too default. It&amp;amp;#39;s not like that. If it woukd have been that easy then the thousands of people that bought crypto during the very beginning would be billionaires by now.

With the recent attempts of regulation in both the US and Canada, I want my crypto to be truly anonymous. How should I go about moving my Bitcoin from my current wallet to a non-kyc exchange so that I can “wash” it? Should I transfer to USDC first? I know if I cash it out and re-enter, that will probably trigger the IRS and that’s the last thing I want. Any and all advice is welcome.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
