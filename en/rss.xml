ETH falls 10% as a result of a larger market decline. This post on CryptoPotato caught my attention because I&amp;amp;#39;ve been investing in ETH for a few years.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The article said: &amp;amp;quot;ETH broke the support at $2,500. This opens the way for a potential drop towards $2,200, which is the first serious level to halt any further declines. The previous support at $2,500 has turned into resistance, and the market outlook is grim. The US stock market is due to open later today and may pull ETH lower still.&amp;amp;quot;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We&amp;amp;#39;re all already dealing with high gas prices and delayed transactions, and we&amp;amp;#39;re all looking for answers through various platforms, whether it&amp;amp;#39;s Loopring, Metis, or something else, and now we&amp;amp;#39;re facing such a drop that it&amp;amp;#39;s truly a bad scenario. Do you have any concerns about it?  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Another news is that Russian-born Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin blasts Putin for Ukraine invasion as crypto nosedive said: &amp;amp;quot;Ethereum is neutral, but I am not.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
I believe that ETH is neutral but it is inevitable that this whole situation will affect its current value, as it has an impact on the entire crypto market. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I&amp;amp;#39;ve gained quite a few downvotes for commenting this, but I think it is solid advice.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now, another dip has presented itself to us. The same advice holds true, we don&amp;amp;#39;t know if the invasion will get worse, and so don&amp;amp;#39;t invest all your money at once. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here are some of the previous dips:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In November, BTC dipped from $65k to $57k, a 12% dip. If you had lump summed in then, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;you&amp;amp;#39;d be down 39% today.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In December, BTC dipped from $57k to $49k, a 14% dip. If you had lump summed in then, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;you&amp;amp;#39;d be down 29% today.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In January, BTC dipped from $47k to $41k, a 13% dip. If you had lump summed in then, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;you&amp;amp;#39;d be down 15% today.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now, I am not saying that you shouldn&amp;amp;#39;t buy the dip, but do it gradually. Every dip seems like the bottom, but it most likely isn&amp;amp;#39;t, especially with this geopolitical turmoil. Do not spend all your money on this dip, keep a good chunk of money to invest if the market falls further. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Lump summing now could be catching a falling knife - don&amp;amp;#39;t get hurt.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

This is going for a huge mess and the market has fluctuated to dump huge way.
Nobody knows how this will go overtime, and this is my advice that look for market to recover, DO NOT blindly buy into the market right now, save your capital wait for the market to stabilize, it doesn&amp;amp;#39;t matter if you think this is the bottom, this is the bottom, &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;People who have enough money can throw around but this is for those who have limited capital
Stay away from buying in at this moment!
Patience is the key just save it up!
Wait for your moment then go for it!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here are a few questions I would like to ask any Russians on this sub:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;1) What is the overall sentiment toward this invasion in Russia right now?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;2) What percentage of people you know have (or had I guess, based on the legality of it now) crypto in Russia?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;3) Do you think most Russians actually approve of Putin or does he not actually have a 100% approval rating like the Kremlin suggests? Does crypto factor into this for you?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;4) In your opinion, what would the best outcome for Russia be in this situation?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;5) If you could move to any country on the planet (including staying in Russia) where would you go? Would crypto factor into your decision?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I realize you might fear for your lives in answering these questions honestly but I am genuinely curious and if you are brave enough to answer honestly you might get a few moons as a tip.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A reminder for crypto new comers who are getting absolutely pantsed and turned around right now. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Selling at a loss historically makes no sense. Overtime crypto and the overall stock market and real estate. It all bounces back.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Time in the market over timing it. Instead of thinking you know what’s gonna happen. Just buy some here and there. And in 2025 maybe we we all be better off for it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All of that being said I’m so sorry if you live in Ukraine I cannot even imagine being a smaller country being brutally attacked by a large and vicious neighbor with no remorse.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fight if you want, escape if you can. Russia kills civilians and supporters of anything western. Just a week ago the US exposed a list of Ukrainians Russians were to kill and put in camps after an invasion.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Please don’t think it cannot happen. Be safe and be smart. Fight hard the Russians are just people.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I started using them about 20 days ago and have been buying around $20 usd of crypto per day to farm their loot boxes, plus around $1500 worth of CRO to hold. There are no fees for the first 30 days so I thought I’d just spread out some buys and see what I get in loot box rewards. So far….like $11 worth of CRO. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In this time I have had three instance where I needed to contact customer service. While it was easy to get in touch with customer service, not one has ever actually fixed the problem. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The first two problems were relatively minor. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I didn’t get the loot box diamonds for a large order I made. I tried to use the support function, still never got them. Honestly, I don’t care that much. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My NFT account and password won’t work. It constantly says my password is incorrect, even though it is 100% correct. I even reset the password, and it still won’t work. I contacted support and we just kept going in loops. It was almost like that scene from Idiocracy where they talk about plants and electrolytes. I wasn’t sure if I wanted to get into NFTs, but I did want to browse. I’ll just not get into NFTs now, no big deal. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The real issue….&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;I spent $500 yesterday for some crypto on the dip. The app glitches out, I get a “transaction cancelled” once the app starts working again, receive no cryto, but I was still charged $500. My banks has confirmed in their system and in Visa that the transaction was approved on their end and the money is at CDC. CDC support is non existent here. They say it isn’t in my transaction history however I sure as hell got charged for it.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While talking to my bank the gentleman I was speaking with said the day before he had the exact same call come in about crypto.com charging people but not delivering the goods. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cdc needs to get their shit together if they are looking for mass adoption to happen through them. I’m assuming I’ll get my $500 back in a few days, but even if I  do I missed an opportunity to buy at a target price because their system isn’t 100% functional. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Maybe they should have spent some of that Matt and Lebron money ensuring their systems work properly.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Automated Translation:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cramming crypto regulation. The European Parliament wants to prohibit the provision of crypto services based on &amp;amp;quot;environmentally unsustainable consensus mechanisms&amp;amp;quot; in its MiCA guidelines. This is according to a final compromise proposal from the responsible Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON), which is available to BTC-ECHO. De facto, this could mean the end for proof-of-work-based cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin from January 1, 2025 in the European Union. The final decision on the draft is to be made in Parliament on February 28.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Stefan Berger told BTC-ECHO that he believes it is &amp;amp;quot;very likely&amp;amp;quot; that the proposal will go through. As Chairman of the ECON Committee, he is largely responsible for the design of the MiCA Directive on the regulation of cryptocurrencies in the European Parliament. The advance of the Bitcoin ban had thereby the SPD, Greens and Left energetically demanded, said the CDU politician in an interview with BTC-ECHO.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The parliamentary groups of the Christian Democrats, right-wing conservatives and liberals would have vehemently resisted the inclusion of the ban in the negotiations. In the end, the Social Democrats, Greens and Left threatened to otherwise withhold their approval of the MiCA draft, according to reports. Previously, SPD politician Joachim Schuster had already publicly called for a bitcoin ban. Green Party European politician Sven Giegold also spoke to BTC-ECHO in favor of illegalization.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The vote next Monday will be followed by a trilogue between the EU Commission, the Parliament and the member states, at the end of which the Commission will be tasked with evaluating the Parliament&amp;amp;#39;s proposal. The decision on this should be expected before the end of this year. In the October 2020 draft, the Commission opposed a bitcoin ban.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitcoin clause is &amp;amp;quot;fatal&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Federal Finance Minister Christian Lindner did not want to comment on the impending bitcoin ban to BTC-ECHO. Frank Schäffler (FDP), member of the Budget Committee of the Bundestag, considers the new proposal of the EU Parliament &amp;amp;quot;fatal&amp;amp;quot;. He already called for changes to the MiCA guidelines last year.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I assume and also expect that the German government and the lead finance minister Christian Lindner will prevent this.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Robert Kopic of the industry association Blockchain for Europe also sees the potential for the clause to &amp;amp;quot;put Europe at a disadvantage.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is a point that would put Europe, along with its green miners, at a disadvantage and would solely lead to them migrating abroad and Europe losing geopolitical access to Bitcoin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The economic disadvantages of a Bitcoin ban are therefore obvious. A fact that the EU Commission will also take into account in its MiCA assessment, says Stefan Berger. What the final decision will ultimately look like is uncertain at this point.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Especially during such few months people forget their strategy and just panic. Knowing what you are doing is the most powerful thing ever. And you don&amp;amp;#39;t rly do that if you through your whole strategy apart at the first sign of danger. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So even if you may think that holding is easy and too default. It&amp;amp;#39;s not like that. If it woukd have been that easy then the thousands of people that bought crypto during the very beginning would be billionaires by now. Being able to hold on to your crypto and prevent sell pressure is indeed a major achievement.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

A trusted launchpad like Binance or even SolanaPrime since it has insurance backing would decrease those chances of scams a lot though.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Welcome to your monthly no-shill data dump: Here&amp;amp;#39;s the very &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;first monthly report for the 2022 Top Ten Experiment&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; featuring &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BTC, ETH, BNB, SOL, ADA, USDC, XRP, LUNA, DOT, and AVAX.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;tl;dr&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;What&amp;amp;#39;s this all about?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven&amp;amp;#39;t sold or traded, reporting monthly for over four years. Did the same in 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;here&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;.  Learn more about the new features in the 2022 Top Ten Experiment&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2022/&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;here&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Snapshots taken on the 1st of each month.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;January Highlights:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Bloody month, all in red except the stable. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;New features:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; easy +11% on &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;USDC&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://cryptex.finance/&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;TCAP&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; takes the first round in my friendly TCAP vs. Top Ten comparison &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;2018+2019+2020+2021+2022 Combined Top Ten Portfolios are returning 224%.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Month One – Down -24%&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/qvj2yi1jmlj81.jpg?width=1048&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=1727944b3ef4d416d75106a10d61f40c49d27c06&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/qvj2yi1jmlj81.jpg?width=1048&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=1727944b3ef4d416d75106a10d61f40c49d27c06&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Welcome to the first monthly update of the brand new 2022 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you want more details on how/where I purchased these cryptos or have any general questions on the Experiment as a whole, feel free to check out my &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2022/21/&quot;&amp;gt;announcement post&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, otherwise, let’s jump in to the first update. Let’s go!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The 2022 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Portfolio is &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BTC, ETH, BNB, Solana, ADA, USDC, XRP, LUNA, DOT, AVAX&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;January highlights for the 2022 Top Ten Portfolio:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A rough start for the  2022 Top Ten Portfolio, down nearly one quarter by the end of January.  &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;USDC&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; is the only crypto in the green&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Traditional markets drop as well, but not nearly as much as crypto&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;January Ranking and Dropouts&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here’s a look at the movement in the ranks one month into the 2022 Top Ten Index Fund Experiment:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/twzj7sm9nlj81.jpg?width=232&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=20b23b5a47188681a52dc58bcd3afb010ea237c4&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/twzj7sm9nlj81.jpg?width=232&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=20b23b5a47188681a52dc58bcd3afb010ea237c4&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A bit of internal shuffling, but not a whole lot of movement in January.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;January Winners and Losers&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;January Winners&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; – Since crypto was down this month, an easy victory for &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;USDC.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Plus I was able to make about +16% on bonuses and interest (more on that below).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;January Losers&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; –  &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;LUNA&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; got hammered in January, losing about -41% of its value.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Overall Update – Bloody start to 2022: 90% of Top Ten in the red.&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1/&quot;&amp;gt;In stark contrast to January 2021,&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; this year is off to a very shaky start.  Never a good sign when first place for the month is a stablecoin (&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;USDC&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;LUNA&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; is at the bottom, down -41% in one month.  The initial $100 invested in &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;LUNA&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; thirty days ago is worth $59 today.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Factoring in USDC Gains&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;New feature this year!&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; – In past years, I have not included the ROI that is possible with stablecoins in the monthly reports. These days, there are many ways to earn ROI using stables alone.  I figure this may be especially interesting this year, depending on how the crypto market performs.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For the 2022 Top Ten Experiment, I will detail ways to build on the $100 &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;USDC&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, starting with the most straightforward strategies.  As we go along in the year, I will share increasingly advanced methods to increase &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;USDC&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. My goal of this little side quest will be to beat the ROI of as many of the non-stablecoin cryptos in the Experiment as possible. A simple task if 2022 ends up being a bear year, a bit more difficult if the crypto market moons.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;January&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; – One of the easiest methods to capitalize on stables (or any crypto for that matter) is to take advantage of sign up bonuses of different platforms, many of which can be triggered with a small initial investment.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As detailed in the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2022/&quot;&amp;gt;2022 Top Ten Index Fund Announcement&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; post, I purchased the $100 of &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;USDC&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; through BlockFi.  I signed up using a promo code and received $10 in &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BTC&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, which I immediately converted to &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;USDC&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.  These codes are everywhere online (or just ask a friend).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Since the BlockFi Interest Account (BIA) is also paying 8.75% APY on stablecoins, the current running total on the $100 initial &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;USDC&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; purchase is: &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$110.64&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/yyuwcf7hnlj81.jpg?width=739&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=1007b85cb5b4683535ac651a02d1650b6f939aff&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/yyuwcf7hnlj81.jpg?width=739&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=1007b85cb5b4683535ac651a02d1650b6f939aff&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There is another BlockFi promo code where you are able to receive $15 in &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BTC&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; on $100, but this bonus can take up to three months.  Going for the $15 bonus might make more sense once you’ve received bonuses from other platforms.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Something to be aware of:&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; US-based BlockFi customers are not currently allowed to add funds to a BIA due to American regulations.  BlockFi is currently in the SEC registration process to offer interest through BlockFi Yield, which will replace BIAs. Bonuses are still valid.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;2022 Top Ten Portfolio vs. Total Crypto Market Cap Token (TCAP)&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Another new feature this year!&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; – The first Top Ten Crypto Experiment was started on 1 January 2018 in an attempt to capture the gains of the entire market. Much has changed in the last four+ years, including innovative Decentralized Finance (DeFi) projects that have created index tokens to capture segments of the crypto market (DeFi, the Metaverse, Blue Chips, etc.) instead of manually buying coins and tokens, like I do for my Experiments.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A project of particular interest to the Top Ten Experiments is the Total Crypto Market Cap (&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://cryptex.finance/&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;TCAP&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;) token, created by Cryptex, which tracks the entire crypto market – exactly what my Top Ten Portfolios have been trying to recreate from the start.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I thought it would be interesting to compare my homemade 2022 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment to the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;TCAP&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; token for a bit of a friendly competition. Here’s the question I’ll be tracking this year: &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;would I have been better off with $1,000 of TCAP instead of going through the effort of creating a homemade $1,000 Top Ten Index Fund?&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;January:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With most of crypto in the red, both the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;TCAP&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; token and the 2022 Top Ten Portfolio got hit hard, down -20% and -24% respectively.  In the end, Round 1 goes to Cryptex’s &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;TCAP&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; token.  Visual below:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/p3uearnjnlj81.jpg?width=484&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=738d98736f3a6029dbb15e5a1929b1d5e42151aa&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/p3uearnjnlj81.jpg?width=484&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=738d98736f3a6029dbb15e5a1929b1d5e42151aa&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Bitcoin Dominance:&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;BitDom started 2022 at 40.2% and ticked up one percentage point in January, ending the month at 41.2%.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/uc3z66etnlj81.png?width=522&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=dd051ace1772b0f5608de8bff64cc7314316f663&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/uc3z66etnlj81.png?width=522&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=dd051ace1772b0f5608de8bff64cc7314316f663&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For those just getting into crypto, it’s worth paying attention to the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Bitcoin&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; dominance figure, as it signals the appetite for altcoins vs. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BTC.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2022:&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/mrjy6uiunlj81.jpg?width=306&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=4a6d040271cea873b6a7bca5682ba606925c834d&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/mrjy6uiunlj81.jpg?width=306&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=4a6d040271cea873b6a7bca5682ba606925c834d&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Unlike the 2021 Top Ten Experiment (&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1/&quot;&amp;gt;which was up +51% in its first month&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;), the 2022 Portfolio is off to a rough start: the initial $1000 investment on New Year’s Day 2022 is now worth &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$762&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, down -24%. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So, where do we stand if we combine five years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-49&quot;&amp;gt;2018 Top Ten Experiment&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;: up +4% (total value $1,035)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;2019 Top Ten Experiment: up +364% (total value $4,639)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;2020 Top Ten Experiment: up +577% (total value $6,766)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;2021 Top Ten Experiment: up +201% (total value $3,009)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1/&quot;&amp;gt;2022 Top Ten Experiment:&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; down -25% (total value $747)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Taking the five portfolios together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom bottom &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;bottom&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; line: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;After a $5,000 investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; the combined portfolios are worth &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$16,196.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That’s &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;up +224&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; on the combined portfolios.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For context, that is &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;way up from one year ago&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; (+127%) but &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;way&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;down from&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;November’s all time high of +553%&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.  To get a sense of the entire journey, here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/93uwa8x4olj81.png?width=600&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=c160172bb1cdce15a83767eaff9cbc4730e92f9c&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/93uwa8x4olj81.png?width=600&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=c160172bb1cdce15a83767eaff9cbc4730e92f9c&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;That’s a +224% gain by buying $1k of the cryptos that happened to be in the Top Ten (including stablecoins) on January 1st, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Comparison to S&amp;amp;amp;P 500&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I’m also tracking the S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 as part of my Experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/josk699aolj81.png?width=538&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=bbd42eea95b9e2135f90387f21819961d16597f6&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/josk699aolj81.png?width=538&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=bbd42eea95b9e2135f90387f21819961d16597f6&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 is down -5% so far in 2022, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on New Year’s Day would be worth $950 had it been redirected to the S&amp;amp;amp;P.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;$1000 investment in S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1,700 today&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;$1000 investment in S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1,810 today&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;$1000 investment in S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,410 today&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;$1000 investment in S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,210 today&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;$1000 investment in S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $950 today&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Taken together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom bottom &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;bottom&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; line for a similar approach with the S&amp;amp;amp;P: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;After five $1,000 investments into an S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 my portfolio would be worth $7,080.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That is up &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;+42%&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/&quot;&amp;gt;since January 2018&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; compared to a &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;+224%&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here’s a fancy new chart showing a combined ROI comparison between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&amp;amp;amp;P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/22hpx3tcolj81.png?width=575&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=9635b15d1b0cb9622b54327bd23e472252f06004&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/22hpx3tcolj81.png?width=575&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=9635b15d1b0cb9622b54327bd23e472252f06004&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Conclusion:&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you so much for sticking around so long. For those just getting into crypto, I hope these reports will help prepare you for the highs and lows that await on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, go with the flow, think long term, don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose, and most importantly, try to enjoy the ride!  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A reporting note: I’ll focus on 2022 Top Ten Portfolio reports + one other portfolio on a rotating basis this year, so expect only two reports from me per month.  This month’s extended report was on the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio, which is almost back down to break even point.  Read all the gory details&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-49&quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;here&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Before crypto I was a major stocks and options investor, who bought high dividend aristocrats like AT&amp;amp;amp;T, then sold covered calls whenever there was an uptick in price on a relatively stable asset. 10% dividends plus options premiums made me drool like you wouldn’t believe. I did put spreads to buy stocks I believed in, iron condors during low volatility phases, the works. I made enough to put a down payment on a house through slow methodical management of my portfolio, while hedging and making money off premiums rather than gambling. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now I yoloswag into new defi protocols like Mmf and darkcrypto, and consistently make 200-700% APR like nobody’s business, even while gaining appreciation on my coins. I still monitor risk and stay away from shitcoins, but I’m constantly yield farming protocols that have gained some traction, and go ham into new protocols that check the boxes for me. 100$ per day from yields on only 10k invested is common now, even during the recent downturn, where before 10k invested meant $100 per MONTH. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It’s absolutely RUINED stocks for me. I went from daily management of my portfolio on fidelity, schwab, and even Robinhood, and have since transferred all of my non-retirement stocks into m1finance (which auto rebalances and DCAs) and look at it once a week at best. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What a ride it’s been. Even as the market tumbled, I’m happily plugging away at the different yield farming opportunities, and While I do have the occasional loss on a protocol that I miscalculated the fall, the winners have made up for the rare loss 10x over. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As I get older and need more stability, I’m sure I’ll return, but as it is, crypto is my roller coaster, and stocks are the teacup ride that you’re forced to go on because your niece can’t go on any other ride. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TL;DR: crypto defi return (and loss) potentials blow all stock plays out of the water, and is my crack cocaine.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Gods Unchained is a blockchain trading card game that &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;takes some of the best features from&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Hearthstone,&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;but has a unique mana system and an original favor feature&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. It allows you to earn cards and trinkets, which you can then sell on the marketplace. NFTs are stored on the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Ethereum&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Immutable-X&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; blockchains. The game is available only for &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Windows.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Take this time to earn some NFT&amp;amp;#39;s in the form of Trading cards that are going up in value and at the same time enjoy playing a game to distract yourself from the crypto winter before us.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Gods Unchained is a play to earn game, completely free to play and advance at your own pace.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I know some of you think NFT&amp;amp;#39;s are stupid but they work great for a trading card games, you actually own your cards and can easily sell, trade and buy cards on the Immutable-X market place.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;you can start playing today and start earning cards today.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Roadmap&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/4iy9twlufhj81.png?width=1110&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=4449f6206dba529b220cf9e58eaf927e40f2fd04&quot;&amp;gt;https://trello.com/b/GpDgnYPZ/gods-unchained-roadmap&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Mobile coming soon&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;What can we expect to see from the game?&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There’s a lot to come with the game, but in order not to ruin the gaming experience achieved through the likes of future expansion sets (e.g. new NFT card sets, we can’t disclose many details. But here’s a high-level overview of what we’re working on.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Mobile game release:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; We have an internal team designing and building out a mobile version of Gods Unchained to ease the barrier of entry by allowing the game to be played on the go. Our first touchstone is to get a playable alpha out this year. Our hope is to deliver the first access to our players in the first half of next year, with a wider alpha sometime in the second half of the year.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Expanding the game:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; We have a heap of new cards coming out early this year with a refresh of our main card set: the Core set (a set is a collection of cards). We also have brand new NFT expansion sets in the works, alongside new game functionalities, items, and modes. To tie these developments all together, the team is also hard at work improving the new player onboarding experience. This will make it easier for anyone and everyone to join Gods Unchained and get playing.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s Time to Duel!&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If any of you decide to play and are up for a challenge let me know, Direct challenges are available and it would be fun to play some of you on this sub.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How it works is it looks at the price graph for the last N (cycling through different values of N) days then tries to find the time the most similar pattern in price occurred in the past to the current pattern, then predicts the price based on what happened after that previous pattern occurred.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is probably worthless and won&amp;amp;#39;t be an accurate reflection of the future price at all, but just for fun, here&amp;amp;#39;s what it says about the next few years of bitcoin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It says that the current pattern we&amp;amp;#39;re in is reminiscent of 2018-01-06.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On the graph, the left side of the green line is the recent price history (red line) and historical price history from 2018-01-06 (blue line), and right of the green line, the future price (red line) is modelled after the price history from 2018.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I personally think it&amp;amp;#39;s a good decision, as they are the ones who have a word in the way the economy is going, so it wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t be fair if they were allowed to trade prior to their own decisions (unfair advantage). &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also, last year there were controversies regarding some positions traded by them right before the COVID measures to help the economy.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto related scams are a dime a dozen and the media also attempts to blow up every single one of em so that these scams have become a major stumbling block for our progress.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The article above talks about how the Greater Manchester Police seized $5.4Mil of crypto from a scam that spannes the globe and are now returning it to the victims who come from places like Europe, China, Australia, HK, UK and the US.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Theres $10Mil more that they plan to recover still and distribute among the 150 or so victims. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I dont know how they did or how they located the victims but i assume having a permanent public ledger that keeps track of all expenses may have helped!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Seeing something like this amidst all the Canadian anti-crypto dicktatorship and Indian taxation issues gives me hope that it may indeed be possible to clamp down on crypto scams. Now if only the politicians would take note.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Does anyone know if the UK has any specific crypto protection laws or are crypto crimes regulated just like other financial crimes?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Namely, it shows how a government deals with cryptocurrencies like bitcoin (BTC) in a situation where it is trying to seize financial resources. And in recent days it became clear that Canadian authorities are not so sure what to do with it!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Canada is on the heels of truckers and supporters&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In Canada, a large group of truckers protested for a long time by blocking cities, border crossings and bridges with their trucks. The action could count on quite some support in Canada and worldwide. The truckers received many donations, also in the form of crypto. After Prime Minister Justin Trudeau activated the controversial and draconian Emergencies Act, authorities were able to freeze bank accounts and obtain data without the intervention of a judge. This is to deal with the support and consequences of the protest.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Freezing Bitcoin Wallets&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So in recent days there have been plenty of articles in crypto news about how Canadian authorities are going after the truckers. But remarkably, they don&amp;amp;#39;t seem to fully understand how crypto works. Nunchuk, a wallet developer recently received an order from the Ontario Superior Court of Justice to &amp;amp;quot;freeze&amp;amp;quot; bitcoin wallets of truckers and &amp;amp;quot;release data.&amp;amp;quot; Such actions are obviously impossible for a wallet developer. In a response, Nunchuk let the court know:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;We do not collect user identification information other than email addresses. We also do not have keys. Therefore, we cannot &amp;amp;quot;freeze&amp;amp;quot; our users&amp;amp;#39; assets. We cannot &amp;amp;quot;prevent&amp;amp;quot; them from being moved. We have no knowledge of &amp;amp;quot;the existence, nature, value and location&amp;amp;quot; of our users&amp;amp;#39; assets. This is by design.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/v6gyr02lzfj81.png?width=588&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=2efad357efd1325441c51876beedd8ad958bbd34&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/v6gyr02lzfj81.png?width=588&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=2efad357efd1325441c51876beedd8ad958bbd34&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If one has bitcoin in one&amp;amp;#39;s own wallet, no one can access it unless they have access to the private key. Keep this private key safe at all times and do not share it with anyone.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I think Russia&amp;amp;#39;s response to this is pretty obvious and telegraphed, they are going to embrace Bitcoin so that their oligarchs and members of government can continue to transact internationally. Hopefully their citizens are also allowed to use it without too much regulation, but not holding my breath. We&amp;amp;#39;ve already seen the draft bill of this, and now more than ever they have a justification to accelerate this. I don&amp;amp;#39;t know whether it happens in the next three weeks or next six month, but it appears to me that the course is set. Putin has been yearning to invade Ukraine ever since 2014, but the financial sanctions that would ensue were probably enough of a deterrent. Up until now. Putin now has an alternative, and he seems to have gained enough confidence in Bitcoin&amp;amp;#39;s decentralized and uncensorable attributes to use it to circumvent the international dollar system.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The reason for this post is to remind people that if/when Russia does this, you might want to reconsider how open you are in public about being a Bitcoiner.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If Russia adopts Bitcoin, the legacy media and politicians are going to very quickly shape and pressure public opinion into believing that Bitcoin is to blame for Russia&amp;amp;#39;s sudden immunity to financial sanctions. They will call it a dictator&amp;amp;#39;s weapon and the reason why their financial warfare tactics are no longer effective. It could even get so bad as to a minority of media claiming that Bitcoiners are colluding with the Russian state. Stuff like &amp;amp;quot;The only reason why you own Bitcoin is to transact with the Russian state&amp;amp;quot; or &amp;amp;quot; Anyone promoting Bitcoin is promoting Russia&amp;amp;quot;. (Writing these easy to predict quips makes me feel physically sick).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I personally have nothing but hatred and disgust for Vladimir Putin. He has shown on countless occasions that he is a psychopathic tyrant who uses force to coerce millions of people in doing things that are beneficial to him and detrimental to them. He is a net negative for humanity.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However, Bitcoin is a neutral technology that is available to all. To dictators and freedom fighters alike. What each person decides to do with that tool is fully their responsibility and has nothing to do with the tool itself. For example, if it &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2021/02/11/russian-opposition-finds-refuge-in-bitcoin-a72907&quot;&amp;gt;weren&amp;amp;#39;t for Bitcoin, there would not be any political opposition in Russia in the first place&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. Just as Putin can benefit by adopting Bitcoin, he can also be tremendously harmed by it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitcoin is apolitical. I know that everyone in this sub understands this. But the majority of people do not.   And I&amp;amp;#39;m afraid that the topic of Bitcoin is about to get disgustingly politicized. If this is the case (I really hope I&amp;amp;#39;m wrong), then you might want to reconsider how open you are about being a Bitcoiner.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The decision will be 100% yours. Some will be defiant and brave enough to take on the senseless criticism heads on. Others will prefer to self-censor to avoid the emotionally draining societal pressure. Every person will know for themselves what the best course of action depending on their unique set of circumstances.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Be mindful that full scale social and political ostracization can be mentally very, very tough.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All I&amp;amp;#39;m saying is to that it´s probably a good idea to decide ahead of time how you are going to act in case this likely scenario does indeed play out. This way you can minimize any regret.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And, I can only hope that this amazing community will continue to be a refuge for divergent and politically alienated people. Whatever you decide to do, I feel confident in saying that Bitcoiners will keep on having each other´s back.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
