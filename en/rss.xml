OP was on a little road trip with his family and when he wanted to get gas his card didn&amp;amp;#39;t work. He called the bank and &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;they had froze my accounts due to &amp;amp;quot;suspected fraudulent activity&amp;amp;quot; and said there was nothing they could do for 24 hours&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sure, that&amp;amp;#39;s how it works, this is a real story. You know, it&amp;amp;#39;s just like that totally not just Hollywood trope but real thing that police have to wait 24 hours to look for a missing person. Okay, so in this real situation OPs life was threatened - stranded, probably in the US - how could one survive for 24 hours?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Well, fortunately OP found a solution:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I remembered I had some money in bitcoin. I was able to find a crypto atm (didn&amp;amp;#39;t even know those existed) within a quarter mile that I walked to. At this atm, I was able to sell some of my bitcoin and withdraw cash from the atm, which I was then able to use to buy gas to get home. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Phew, he escaped death this time. Someone posted this story on this sub as well before, titling it &amp;amp;quot;That’s why we need Crypto&amp;amp;quot;. And that&amp;amp;#39;s absolutely true! But just in case you ever get into such a life-threatening situation and don&amp;amp;#39;t have crypto, I have some advice for you:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;don&amp;amp;#39;t die, ideally. There is nothing dangerous about the situation, worst case is you&amp;amp;#39;ll have to spend the night somewhere close-by and pay once your accounts get unfrozen (even though it&amp;amp;#39;s reeeeally unlikely that your accounts, plural, all get frozen and that your wife, who is accompanying you, seemingly doesn&amp;amp;#39;t have any)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;carry a bit of cash with you? I know, cash is not as obvious as crypto and many people don&amp;amp;#39;t know you can exchange it for goods, but it actually works quite well, with instant, free transactions&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;To sum up: don&amp;amp;#39;t make up incredibly stupid stories that try to show how useful crypto is, and then make up a situation that could much more easily be solved using cash. Yes, we all like crypto and hope it will have a lot of utility in the future, but we don&amp;amp;#39;t have to pretend it&amp;amp;#39;s more essential than it is in today&amp;amp;#39;s world.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There is an indicator called &amp;amp;quot;Bitcoin fear and greed chart&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/&quot;&amp;gt;https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The formula is simple, if you see it over 70-80 and &amp;amp;quot;Extreme Greed&amp;amp;quot; is present, this is when you should consider transferring cryptos into USDTs.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now let&amp;amp;#39;s say you&amp;amp;#39;ve been sitting on USDT coins, and you feel like you want to buy a dip that just happened. Before you do that, you head over to the same damn chart, and check what it says.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anytime below 25-20 is an excellent time to buy.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And that&amp;amp;#39;s it folks, the formula is extremely easy. Now we are seeing Extreme fear on the chart at 25. Is it a good time to buy?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

He said that crypto could benefit from a crash as short term speculative attention is not good in the long run, while builders could benefit from less attention from speculators. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now he has made his strongest statement yet confirming the bear market, as he showed up to the EthDenver conference dressed as a bear. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/hmnqu19nc5j81.jpg?width=623&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=0ed400f123b11ec14e6c91039a6c9e26fe8bdc36&quot;&amp;gt;Lord Saviour bear. &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Few other shots of the bear spotted in the wild:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/isukgm8rc5j81.jpg?width=555&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=728ca572bf3ca15f32bcc7bbf4904edf482aaf2f&quot;&amp;gt;The menacing bear&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/farksdfvc5j81.jpg?width=1200&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=d94260c21c8e5fd42bf36141e8da81fe3b4f61b9&quot;&amp;gt;Fashion speaks louder than words. &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto markets have corrected steeply from their highs made in 2021 and the weak price action looks set to continue as geopolitical risks and fed tightening cycle are set to play out throughout 2022. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However, there is a debate among crypto market participants as to what actually constitutes a bear market. In stocks, a bear market is typically said to occur when stock prices crash by 20%. However given the volatile nature of crypto markets, 20% is a rather low threshold, and it is debatable whether 50% would also constitute a bear market or if it is just a down trend in an historically up only market. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In this context, Vitalik Buterin - one of the prominent leaders of the space laying it down is a rather strong statement that we are indeed in a bear market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Was heading home from a little road trip and had to stop around about 2 hours away from home for gas. Had the wife and kids with me. Went to fill up and my cards keep getting declined. Try to call the bank and they had froze my accounts due to &amp;amp;quot;suspected fraudulent activity&amp;amp;quot; and said there was nothing they could do for 24 hours. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;No way to access any of my money and didn&amp;amp;#39;t have enough gas to make it home. Was starting to get a little nervous. Then I remembered I had some money in bitcoin. I was able to find a crypto atm (didn&amp;amp;#39;t even know those existed) within a quarter mile that I walked to. At this atm, I was able to sell some of my bitcoin and withdraw cash from the atm, which I was then able to use to buy gas to get home. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Insanely lucky I had funds that were practical/useful when my bank was not accessible. And thus I realized the true benefit of Bitcoin. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Just wanted to share, as I&amp;amp;#39;ve never seen, firsthand, the practical use of crypto currency before. Here was a situation where I was unable to access a resource through a &amp;amp;quot;respected&amp;amp;quot; financial institution, but i was able to access and utilize crypto currency. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TLDR: Stuck out of town and needed gas. Bank accounts frozen but was able to use BTC to pay and get home.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

This is mainly because there are absolutely aspects of crypto investing that give off Ponzi vibes to the uninitiated - just look at all those rugged tokens, even the DAO&amp;amp;#39;s that make headlines because of sudden price plummets etc. And no doubt the 2017ish Bitcoin craze where thousands of people bought the top before a very cold winter is still fresh in people&amp;amp;#39;s minds, alongside BTC&amp;amp;#39;s current price situation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So my question is: how do you guys address the common accusation that we&amp;amp;#39;re all just crabs trying to claw our way to the tippy-top of a grand digital ponzi? Many thanks.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The investigation: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.occrp.org/en/suisse-secrets/historic-leak-of-swiss-banking-records-reveals-unsavory-clients&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.occrp.org/en/suisse-secrets/historic-leak-of-swiss-banking-records-reveals-unsavory-clients&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These are some of the clients of the bank described in the whistleblower article: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A Yemeni spy chief implicated in torture. The sons of an Azerbaijani strongman who rules a mountainous territory as his own private fiefdom. Bureaucrats accused of looting Venezuela’s oil wealth and hastening its descent into humanitarian crisis.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Credit Suisse’s clients included the family of an Egyptian intelligence chief who oversaw torture of terrorism suspects for the CIA; an Italian accused of laundering criminal funds for the infamous ‘Ndrangheta criminal group; a German executive who bribed Nigerian officials for telecoms contracts; and Jordan’s King Abdullah II, who held a single account worth 230 million Swiss francs ($223 million) at its peak, even as his country raked in billions in foreign aid.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Venezuelan elites accused of plundering the state oil firm funneled hundreds of millions of dollars into Credit Suisse accounts. The money flowed during a period when widespread looting from government coffers precipitated an economic collapse that has prompted six million people to flee the country and driven others into near starvation. The bank kept its Venezuelan clients’ accounts open even as global media exposed corruption cases against many of them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These kind of people have zero problems laundering their ill gotten wealth via the banking system, but damn if you earned more than $600 in staking rewards, you have to start reporting via Form 1099, if you spend $10k in crypto, it will have to be reported directly to the IRS. All these regulations and laws are put in place to track crypto because regulator and central bankers constantly attack crypto as a conduit for money laundering. However the biggest criminal enterprises solely rely on the banking system for laundering their funds.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Drug cartels or Venezuelan elites who looted their own government have no issues with KYC, but if you make a p2p or anonymous crypto transaction, you can risk your funds being locked!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The loops you have to go to have your crypto income accounted as a legitimate source of earning, only for those in the government to accuse crypto of facilitating money laundering, crimes and whatnot...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But when the actual allegations come out its invariably the central banking system that facilitates money transmission operations for some of the largest criminal enterprises in the world, including drug cartels and human rights abusers and corrupt rulers. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These are quotes from employees of Credit Suisse:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“When someone wants to engage in money laundering after he loots assets of the country, for example, he needs to transfer the money. So holders of big accounts go directly to the very senior managers,” he said.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The system was based on plausible deniability, said former employees. Bankers are given strict rules, but the incentives are to ignore them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“The bank’s compliance department are masters of plausible deniability,” the former senior manager said. “Never ask a question you do not want to know the answer to.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fast forward to a whole 7 days later and there are multiple posts about being in a crypto winter for the foreseeable future. This is the volatility that comes with the territory of being in the space so instead of riding the roller coaster it might benefit some to just unplug from the daily/weekly news and chart watching. If you set your limit orders and price alerts then go live your life, it’s much harder to be affected by the constant volatility. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Who knows what’s in store for next week? Personally I think it’s bearish news for the foreseeable future with, coming interest rate hikes, tax season, and the constant threat of global conflict despite institutional involvement being at an all time high.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

So please keep an open mind.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here&amp;amp;#39;s my story:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Installed Nami wallet. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Started a withdrawal of just 5 Ada from Kraken to this wallet, it took 30 minutes (??) for funds to arrive.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Went to SundaeSwap, tried to swap 1 Ada for 1.4 Sundae but kept saying that I have insufficient funds, apparently Sundae has additional fees that I was not aware of (2.5 Ada + some refundable deposit of 2 Ada).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Waited another 30 minutes to withdraw more Ada.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Big red warning on the Sundae page that the network is heavily congested. Checked the explorer and blocks were indeed (85%+) full while running at 2 tps. How is that possible?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;First 4 swap attempts failed with 0 warnings, nothing to be found on-chain in the explorer, just pending attempts that disappeared after reconnecting my wallet.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The 5th one I think was recorded on-chain and remained in pending.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;40 minutes later another on-chain swap attempt magically appeared, probably from the first 4 &amp;amp;quot;failed&amp;amp;quot; txs. Wtf?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Tried to cancel this second order...cancellation pending with 0 feedback on what is happening, tried to cancel 3 more times... nothing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Exactly one hour and 7 minutes later the first swap completed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m used to getting near instant confirmations and swaps on other networks, 1 hour+ is definitelly the longest I&amp;amp;#39;ve ever had to wait on any Dex by a factor of 1000x and combined with all the fails and weird behaviour that I got I can&amp;amp;#39;t call this a good UX.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This sub is something way more volatile than crypto. Any minor movement causes a complete shift from bull to bearish in this subs sentiment. And during major movements like this, the sub goes completely crazy. Making predictions of either 100k in a week or as now 18k tomorrow. If you would listen to this sub you would absolutely master buy high sell low. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You should not listen to anyone actually during rough times and during very amazing times. Those are the moments you should keep your plan to yourself. Just strictly follow it and sell/buy when YOU think it&amp;amp;#39;s right. That way you won&amp;amp;#39;t regret it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The main focus, as Vitalik stated, should be 2 things:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;• The move to PoS&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;• Sharding&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Any additional features are just polishing the network to make it as perfect as possible.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the meantime, Vitalik is solely focused on Zk rollups as the future of scalability for Ethereum.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This decision to build around rollups came back in 2020 when Vitalik wrote an article titled “A roll-up-centric ethereum roadmap” where he explained how Ethereum would be all in on rollup tech (Give it a read its very interesting).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I guess this is why he’s so fond of MATIC recently considering they’ve invested into every single ZK rollup tech available on the market and have proven to be top dogs when it comes to scalability.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So while the final stage or ETH2.0 might take a while, we should soon start seeing a lot more improvement from both Ethereum and side chains like Polygon.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

About two weeks ago I recently won a little bit of money gambling and couldn’t transfer it to my bank, I could however withdraw it in BTC and was just going to set up an account on Coinbase and withdraw it when it hit. I didn’t know anything about BTC or crypto (and I still know very little) and after this price drop I started panicking a teeny bit and was confused. I found the subreddit  and started browsing it and I realized, Bitcoin isn’t about making a profit or a quick buck, it’s a slap in the face to the government and banks who think they can control every aspect of our life. It’s a slap in the face to people like Trudeau who thinks they can freeze our accounts because we don’t comply to their every demand. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thank you all for showing me the real meaning behind crypto and BTC. Going to invest a little more and get a cold wallet soon. F the Gov n F the greedy ass banks.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Looking close at those 7 million dollars. A lot of the buyers were brand new . I mean, there were so many that had never done anything on ether scan before. A series of shadow wallets all created by one person that was all buying tons of Squiggles.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A single account, that spent 800 Ethereum, which is over 2 million dollars spread across two transactions, that created hundreds of new wallets .Each of these shadow wallets, then bought three squiggles a piece and immediately listed them on open sea for less money.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You might be wondering why do this? Why buy two million dollars worth of squiggles only to sell them for less? Well, the only reason that makes sense to me is they were trying to give the illusion of huge interest to get people to buy in to make people think this had a lot of trading volume , a lot of hype. The only people who could possibly want to do that is of course the team behind squiggles.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Fidelity, BlackRock, and greayscale our some of the big institutions accumulating BTC on the sideline and giving way to major adoptions to conservative investors and curious investors who wants to dip in digital assets.  Given that big institutions are entering the market are you seeing the bright future of BTC along the way.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He has always talked about how he’d love to Bitcoin mine on a small scale. Around December, I told him we should do it. Our current home would sell for a great price, we’d move to a state with the best energy rates (Arkansas is our choice). We’re going to buy a much less expensive home with land, pay for it almost in full with the equity from our current home and buy 11-12 machines to start with the remaining equity.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We’ve already calculated everything - the energy costs in the area we’re purchasing in and how much profit we’d make as well. We wouldn’t be living luxuriously, especially with two young children, but it would be enough to pay the bills and my husband to not need to work anymore.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I’m nervous about this new adventure, but also excited.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

And, weirdly enough, it seems this wasn&amp;amp;#39;t against any rules - and to be fair, this doesn&amp;amp;#39;t necessarily need to be shady in any way, but it&amp;amp;#39;s a really bad look. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/27/dallas-fed-president-kaplan-to-retire-early-on-oct-8-citing-trading-disclosure-distraction.html&quot;&amp;gt;Some people had to leave their positions&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, even though nothing illegal happened, this was a pretty bad look.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Okay, so now they &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/18/fed-approves-rules-banning-its-officials-from-trading-stocks-bonds-and-also-cryptocurrencies.html&quot;&amp;gt;approved rules banning their officials from doing that&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. This is very reasonable. Should it have been done earlier? But, considering things happened already, is there anything better they could have done? I mean... not really? They reacted appropriately. There were no rules, this was bad, now there are rules. No reason to praise them for it, but they did the correct thing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So what does this sub do? You can guess it, &amp;amp;quot;government bad&amp;amp;quot;. Read the replies in &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/swam4i/according_to_a_decision_by_federal_open_market/&quot;&amp;gt;this post&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, or the ones in his even worse post titled &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/swcozf/feds_get_caught_insider_trading_government_says/&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Feds get caught insider trading, government says OOPSIE&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. Let me quote a few: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;This is just stupid&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;This will just make shit worse&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Oh so now they want to prohibit it after all the years they made millions upon millions of dollars.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;In completely unrelated news the average net worth of thr spouses of these employees has gone up 500%&amp;amp;quot; (yes, of course this is prohibited now as well, as you would know if you would actually read any article)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Fuck the government and the feds. They only do shit that benefits themselves.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;They&amp;amp;#39;re all fucking crooks&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Rules are beneath us. - Governments, prolly.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;People, what do you want? This is an example of a government body seing a bad situation and actually improving it. I am not a fan of the US government, but in this case, what tf do you want? Do you not understand the situation at all, or is the only situation you would say something positive about the government if they said &amp;amp;quot;we give everyone 10 BTC!!!&amp;amp;quot;?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Ugh. Sorry for the rant, but this is really ridiculous.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

All physical copies of the seed phrase are destroyed. This money is now mine and no one else&amp;amp;#39;s. I could be stripped of all my possessions, thrown in jail, declared an enemy of the state etc... but as long as I still remember that seed phrase the money is MINE. If that&amp;amp;#39;s not the coolest way to store value in history I don&amp;amp;#39;t know what is. Its like magic.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If anyone is wondering how I did this, I used a memory castle. This is a great thing to learn and not that hard. The core principle is to attach whatever you want to memorize to something in your long term memory. I just used my childhood home growing up. I take each seed word, and create a silly image of that thing in relation to some part of the home I grew up in. Then I can just imagine myself moving around my childhood home, and I see each of the seed words in relation to something I could never forget (The table my parents did taxes on, the entryway to the kitchen, the fireplace I sat next to in the wintertime etc etc.).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cryptocurrency isn&amp;amp;#39;t just a way to get rich. Its an incredibly powerful new technology. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;EDIT: Well guys you were right... I was putting on my pants this morning and fell over due to the weight of my massive balls. I struck my head and now my seed phrase is lost forever. At least they can never take away my massive cock and balls. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
