There&amp;amp;#39;s no promise of some complex protocol to come 3, 5, or 10 years down the road. It does what it&amp;amp;#39;s supposed to now without self promotion from the founders.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;BTC takes out the corruption of humans, because the humans that created it stepped away. Sure, people will build corrupt systems around it, but BTC itself is a simple, pure, and elegant vehicle that will silently tick away in the background until the ticking becomes so loud that no one can ignore it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;so yeah we all know that UST has drastically de-pegged.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;most people here believe that Citadel and Gemini or whoever did a coordinated attack to lower its value because they had loans in it (basically shorting it). Not like anyone cares to provide any sort of evidence for that because &amp;amp;quot;trust me bro&amp;amp;quot; is more than sufficient for that.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;other people say that LUNA and its stablecoins were always a ponzi scheme or a rugpull or whichever other words the average redditor wrongly uses as a synonym for any sort of scam, fraud, flaw or loss of value to appear smarter than the Safemoon crowd.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;in reality LUNA and UST are just massive failures due to a pretty significant flaw in the way UST was supposed to keep its peg. thing is its not backed by real USD and its also not overcollateralized, like DAI for example.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;the way algorithmic stablecoins keep their value (or don&amp;amp;#39;t apparently) is that you can always burn them for $1 worth of LUNA. Not for any fixed amount of LUNA, but for whatever amount of LUNA currently has a value of $1.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;this does have the advantage that you don&amp;amp;#39;t rely on a centralized company or on people that take risky DeFi loans to mint the stablecoin. But this completely collapses if too many people cash out at once.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;See you only get 1 US dollar thru that algorithmic approach if you burn 1 UST for LUNA and then sell your LUNA. This is a problem because if LUNA is being sold it is losing value and if masses of people sell it at once it could lose its value faster than you can sell your $1 worth of LUNA for $1. And in that case UST is practically no longer backed by enough value.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Maybe there was an attack, maybe not. That a stablecoin loses its value at any exchange for a short period of time isn&amp;amp;#39;t a problem. That happens all the time, even if only rarely to more than one percent. But that the algorithm that gave UST its value is completely unable to let the UST holders cash out without eating each other alive always made it a ticking time bomb. There is no need for any sort of attack for UST to collapse, this was bound to happen at some point.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I have the majority of my portfolio in BTC and ETH with smaller positions in some alts, so around the end of October to the beginning of November my portfolio was up around 70%. At that time pretty much everything in my portfolio was up. Some assests were up 300%+, but I was part of the DCA and hold crowd, so I did just that.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I held all of my profits and didn&amp;amp;#39;t take any profits at all. Everyone was saying &amp;amp;quot;$100k BTC by the end of the year!&amp;amp;quot; and I fell for it. I thought the bullrun would continue, and decided to just keep holding. Then the bear market hit.... Everything was down more and more, but I was still in profit due to having an average BTC buyin price of $34,000 and the performance of alts like SOL, KCS and LUNA (😭) that I bought in at a good price for and were still up a lot from my buyin price. Then this crash happened. My 70% in profit portfolio just seven months ago is now 20% in the red. All those unrealized profits have been wiped out. It&amp;amp;#39;s all play money that I could afford to lose so it doesn&amp;amp;#39;t matter too much and won&amp;amp;#39;t affect my life at all, but it taught me a valuable lesson to take profits when you get them. Holding is fine and will probably still work out, but I could have had a lot more money to invest now if I had taken those profits.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;TL;DR:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Don&amp;amp;#39;t sit on profits too long. Take profits when you can, because they could disappear at any moment.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Dip is 10-20% down. Don&amp;amp;#39;t buy it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When it happens, Redditors will jump on you screaming &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;BUY THE DIP&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; directly to your ear. Don&amp;amp;#39;t buy it. You&amp;amp;#39;re calm, your mind is clear, you aren&amp;amp;#39;t fueled by emotions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Soon it will dip 20-30%. You will notice frequent memes like&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What I thought was the dip. The dip. The actual dip. The actual dips dip.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Logically, you still don&amp;amp;#39;t take the bait. You play the waiting game. You are in charge here.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Next leg is minus 30-40%. Some people are borrowing money to buy here, since they spent all of their money on previous dips. Some people start questioning is this just a correction or bearmarket. You will notice posts like&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When Bitcoin was 60k you wished you bought it at 40k. Now it&amp;amp;#39;s below 40k buy now as you promissed!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You just smirk reading this post, take a sip of your tea, scroll down, turn on radio or something.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Next leg is minus 40-60% from ATH. Alts are massacred. You will notice that no one will even mention buying the dip, even as a joke. Even people who bought the dips are now down so much, that their stress is somehow even as the literal top buyers. People are now posting predictions of low will it go.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At this point, you start stretching. Counting your money. Calculating how much can you afford to spend on crypto. Getting prepared for the last stage.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;60-80% correction, bearmarket acceptance and capitulation phase&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Suicide hotline number is posted, and pinned by moderators. Divorce rates increase. People are selling for a loss, because they are emotionally damaged and don&amp;amp;#39;t want to play this game anymore. Others are just deleting apps related to crypto on their phones. Moonboys are out. Newbies are out. Sub is pretty much dead, low number of comments and posts. There isn&amp;amp;#39;t hope on a horizon.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is where you start buying. You also accumulate every now or then when you can afford. You do this for next two years or whenever next rally starts. Here&amp;amp;#39;s how to recognize when to exit, also know as top signals:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;People are understandably upset, posts here are now emotionally charged. However the writing was on the wall as highlighted in my previous post&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I don&amp;amp;#39;t intend this to be a told you so post, I want to simply urge people to be cautious and think twice before overinvesting.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is NOT a dip, this is likely the start of a drawn out bear market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Inflation and rates are still on the rise, there are no immediate fixes for the supply issue, covid is still running rampant and the risk of war escalating grows by the day.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Luna debacle broke alot of trust in stablecoins and crypto generally. People are all of a sudden realising these so called guaranteed stable coin returns were actually unrealistic and made of unicorn dust. Alot of people are taking a step back and thinking, are the returns on my staking realistic? Could I be like the Luna holders and not be able to take funds out in the event of a crash? Where are the returns coming from?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All valid risks, people are much cautious. The authorities will regulate this space as a result. They have their catalyst. They could force other stables like tether to reveal their assets and they too could be made of unicorn dust.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My message is this. The risks are still very grave here and if your not prepared to whether the storm think seriously about investing and never invest more than you can afford to lose.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I am still bullish long term. I will be patiently DCAing awaiting the next run. We will all be ok, just be sure you understand now is an extremely risky time to be investing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On most staking networks, you have a long unlock period. Its 14 days or something for Luna, 21 days on other chains.. and this period is enough for your coin to lose 99% of its value when an onchain event plays out. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To prevent staking unlock period risk, you can go for liquid staking but that has its own risks like smart contract risks and trust in a third party app and code. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the present scenario, if you had bought Luna at a higher level and staked it, you are shit out of luck. If you had not staked it, you could have exited at a much higher level. Stakers are most likely going to lose all the value.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Hysteria in &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/Coinbase&quot;&amp;gt;r/Coinbase&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, you&amp;amp;#39;d think there&amp;amp;#39;s blood running in the streets.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As I myself can attest, many people are unable to get their USD or coins out of Coinbase. Mysterious error messages happen if you try. (I can put money in and buy though.)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Why? This is speculation but you know it&amp;amp;#39;s true: a classic bank run. All the hysteria and FUD on Reddit is contributing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It happens every crash like clockwork.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Coinbase simply doesn&amp;amp;#39;t have the cash to cover the run. Like all CEXes including Kraken and Binance, they&amp;amp;#39;re fractionally reserved. The balances shown are not actually on any blockchain or cash vault - until you withdraw or transfer. (In fact it&amp;amp;#39;s very possible that once the last BTC is mined or close to it, that someday CEXes will sell more BTC combined than actually exists.)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There&amp;amp;#39;s nothing inherently &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;wrong&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; with that. Nowadays banks can get away without &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;any&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; reserves. But the FUD on Reddit is not helping, so blame your fellow Redditors. I&amp;amp;#39;m not saying I like it, but it is the way the world works for now. And in a world economic system that falls apart if constant exponential growth is not maintained, what else do you expect? Don&amp;amp;#39;t like it? Vote for people who promise to change that fundamentally flawed system.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Either way, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Coinbase is not going bankrupt anytime soon, certainly not this crash&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. Relax. They&amp;amp;#39;ll be back online. I&amp;amp;#39;m not happy about it either, but take a frickin chill pill already.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Each time this happens, it seems they get better at covering runs. Maybe they increase their reserve policies each time, who knows. Either way, you&amp;amp;#39;ll get your coins. Sucks now, no doubt, but you aren&amp;amp;#39;t going to lose your money. Not this time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The memes, the fear, the panic, and the echo chamber quality of it all.  But above all, I stay for the quality memes.  Here are some of my musings.  Hopefully it can offer some comfort for those of you who bought at ATH.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;1) Don&amp;amp;#39;t mention explicitly the total amount that you have.  I made this mistake early on and the amount of &amp;amp;quot;advice&amp;amp;quot; I got to sell from the original run from 1000 to 3000 was incredibly irritating.  You cannot imagine how much louder it got from the 17k or 18k peak when it went all the way back down to 4k or 5k.  The panic was everywhere.  Do not be surprised if the same happens again on this downturn. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;2) Stick to the fundamentals.  Price discovery does not necessarily reflect the underlying value of bitcoin.  Are blocks being mined? Are transactions being processed? If yes, just keep your head down and continue holding.  I anticipate, even expect, that bitcoin will keep getting attacked; bad actors will keep coming and going (Jihan, your tweet will forever be hilarious).  If you want to do your part (and can afford to), run a node.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;3) Please do not trade (including leveraged trades).  I started off as a &amp;amp;quot;trader&amp;amp;quot;.  I started with 100 and tried to do the compound math game of closing the day with 5% gains.  Being able to pull it off for a few days in a row (in a bull market), I thought I was a genius then all those years ago.  After a month, however, I ended up with slightly less than 100.  Then, by a sheer stroke of luck, it clicked for me that trading was a fool&amp;amp;#39;s game.  Most traders lose.  I did not think I was the exception to the rule.  It was after this moment I started to just quickly buy and hold.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;4) For whatever reason, being in bitcoin has somehow changed my spending habits and how I view material things.  I try to live on less and I try to unsubscribe from the endless consumerism that is everywhere.  It almost feels as if unchecked consumerism, inflation, and capitalism are all somehow interconnected for me.  Someone else can probably word it more eloquently.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;5) I have found it helpful to view bitcoin as a savings vehicle.  I continue to buy today, even when it was above 55000, 40000, etc.  It does not matter.  I just want to protect what &amp;amp;quot;value&amp;amp;quot; I have in FIAT from getting eroded by monetary policies that do not quite seem to benefit the small fish.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;6) I have not found it helpful to talk about it with friends and family.  So I mostly stay quiet now, even going so far as to feign ignorance on the topic if needed.  I think I am terrible at explaining it (might be why).  The reactions I have seen over the years are is that it is fake, can be manipulated, what if it goes to 0, what if I am wrong, and when will I sell?  I rarely try to correct their thinking.  I do subscribe to the quote that people will buy into it at the price they deserve.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;del&amp;gt;7) I must confess, I have not read the whitepaper.  I have copies of it, but I have never read it.  Yes, this is heresy.&amp;lt;/del&amp;gt;  At the encouragement of some, I mustered up the courage to read the whitepaper.  It was not as scary as I thought!  Thanks!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;8) I do not own anything else.  I just do not understand it.  There are so many technical terms now that are thrown around.  It is intimidating.  I remember receiving messages back in the day when a certain coin, starting with E, was priced at $3.  Maybe some of you can too.  What I have seen, however, is that a lot of these other things come and go, like the seasons.  I wonder why that is. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;9) Stay for the memes! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I cannot and do not say these things in real life anymore.  May this help some of you new bitizens in this space.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;PS. Hopefully, I did not make any typing errors.  English is not my main language!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Other stablecoins are suffering the pressure as well as people try to cash out. This may be nothing really, and I hope it&amp;amp;#39;s nothing. USDT has hold for so many years. But we better be safe than sorry. This is just a warning for people here and I hope everything goes smoothly for USDT and other stablecoins during the next few days where the pressure for cashing out will be kinda high. I&amp;amp;#39;m sorry for everyone that lost on the Terra / Luna disaster, remember money is not everything and you learned an important lesson. Also, people with money on Celsius and other high APY &amp;amp;quot;projects&amp;amp;quot;, please think twice before going for a promise of double digits APY.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Every single post 9 times out of 10 was pure hopium and anyone with a different view was downvoted into oblivion. Majority of the posts here reminded me of the whole DOGE to the moon phase.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I don&amp;amp;#39;t learn anything new in here and have to resort to other subs to keep myself up to date with tech.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And the people I see claiming to be in crypto for 10 years and just HODL are so full of shit by just doing a simple search through their post history.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;People were telling you at $50k &amp;amp;quot;invest all your bags!&amp;amp;quot; and &amp;amp;quot;BTC is on sale it will never be this low again&amp;amp;quot;. Those same people claimed we were in a &amp;amp;quot;bear market&amp;amp;quot; I honestly heard that term thrown out so much that I even question if I know what it means anymore.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Welcome to an actual bear market. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You have the idea to HODL but many of you are completely over leveraged. You over invested what you could afford to lose and have the mindset that you&amp;amp;#39;re still going to HODL. That&amp;amp;#39;s ok.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Heres what&amp;amp;#39;s going to happen over the course of the next year or so.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto market could get worse and stay like this for a couple years. Most of you will lose hope and something will come up in life (bills, trips, etc). You will take a little bit out promising you will put more back in eventually. Slowly depleting your portfolio. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Years will go by and the next run will come and then you will reinvest again but this time will be different.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Your lessons will be your own. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We&amp;amp;#39;re all full of shit on here no one knows shit. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Start learning about the technology behind everything and the backend stuff in order to fully believe in crypto. Hopium posts on Reddit, MSNBC, tech crunch articles are not going to keep your hopes up.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit 1: There’s other subs on here that will be helpful. Discord groups, reading white papers, even Twitter has gold.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Terra&amp;amp;#39;s market dropped from 6.7 billion USD to 790 million USD in 24 hours. Do people seriously think that this sharp decline in price can be tied to retail dumping billions in a matter of hours? Bullshit. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Few whales got together and exploited the mistake on Terras part, eventually wiping out retail money for their own profit. There is no evidence yet as it is too soon to be 100% sure, but there are many theories about potential exploits and some people have been warning in the past about it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But few really knew how hard can it be to hodl through a market crash.
Fewer even knew the toll it will take on your mental health.
And they were mostly 2018 market crash survivors.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Most of us who bought at 2021 bull run are suffering heavy losses. If we sell of course.
It is really hard not to panic. And even harder to see your 10k worth 2k.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I wish we all have strength to hold and wisdom to buy instead of panic selling because this is the correct time to buy and not at peak hype of 2021.
And those of us who hold through this will get rewarded. And if you came out of this mess with a nice profit, when someone talks about how lucky you were, you owe it to yourself to tell them to go F themselves.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Have a great day&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I just want to share it with someone and sadly I don&amp;amp;#39;t know anyone involved in crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When CRO sunk, I sold my $ 10k worth of CRO and bought LUNA. I was already at loss but somehow I saved 10k. Before they were 20k. CRO was 50% of my whole portfolio. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yesterday my 10k became 2500$. I was shocked that 20k became 2.5k just because someone decided to make a mess. I have no problem with normal fluctuations, I invest in crypto since 2 years and I don&amp;amp;#39;t panic when the market is not bullish. But man, cro and Luna did a mess because of their owners! It&amp;amp;#39;s different! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I never did margin trading. I always just bought and hold relevant projects. My initial and only investment was 400$ 2 years ago, I&amp;amp;#39;m not rich and all my portfolio was built by holding. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I decided to take 1250$ and use it to short Luna. It was worth 25$. I went to sleep and this morning it was worth 15$. I was so happy for few seconds, then I realized that I got liquidated during the night so I actually lost all.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I ended up with my last 1250$.
Luna was still falling. I decided to put everything and short it again. 
It went down to 9$, I took profit and short it again by reinvesting everything (previous profit included). &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It went down to 6$, I took profit and short it again everything I had. Now my liquidation price was 6.1$&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It went down to 4$. If I sold, I would take back almost everything I lost. I decided to wait, I suffered to much because of this mess and I deserved to get a full refund.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It went up to 5.5$. I started to panic. Just few cents and I would get liquidated. You&amp;amp;#39;ll never believe me, but for few seconds it went up to 6.15$, I throw away my phone thinking I got liquidated, but for some mysterious reason it didn&amp;amp;#39;t happen.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I checked back my phone after 1 hour. LUNA was now worth 2.90$ and I realized I didn&amp;amp;#39;t get liquidated! I closed my position and thanked the Gods of crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;ll never margin trade again, I&amp;amp;#39;ll never invest in shady projects, I&amp;amp;#39;ll keep investing in btc, ETH and few others like I always did before.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
