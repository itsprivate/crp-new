Crypto hasn&amp;amp;#39;t yet lost its steam and it was dragged down by the stock market for the past few days. This has accumulated A LOT of shorters.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/lx6hz6ct4vf81.jpg?width=1525&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=3a4eec27f4f445c3f55ba4977521da9c6237463b&quot;&amp;gt;Short positions are extremely high&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Just looking at this alone should give you a picture of what has been happening. There are a lot of people that are shorting the market right now, and a Bitcoin short squeeze is likely considering that whales have been eating up the weeks long selling pressure with huge purchases. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Short  Squeeze Indications&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Substantial amount of buying pressure.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;  ✅ &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;RSI below 30 for an unnatural amount of time.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; ✅ &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Short interest way above 20%.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;  ✅ &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Huge sudden uptick in price.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; ✅ &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The market indications are suggesting a textbook short squeeze scenario for Bitcoin, and that might potentially reverse the Crypto market&amp;amp;#39;s trajectory. Remember, Bitcoin is already 10% up in a matter of a few hours. This means people shorting are at a loss and they will either have to sell at a loss or borrow more shares, driving up the price. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;TLDR:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Bitcoin closed one of the biggest green candles in over a year, and it is most likely the beginning of a short squeeze due to an unusually large amount of people shorting the market. Moreover, surpassing 40k in a matter of  hours just invalidated weeks of FUD. If this continues, investors will be looking at a bullish Crypto market and a bearish stock market which is possibly the best environment for another huge bull run.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Investigating Latency&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;We&amp;amp;#39;re investigating latency on Coinbase.com and the mobile app and difficulty with trades / payments. Our teams are working to restore full service ASAP.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Interesting that the exchanges never go down when the market crashes. When that happens and everyone scrambles online to try and paperhand sell their crypto in a race to the bottom they seem to always work impeccably.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However, the markets suddenly surge over 10% and they suddenly just cannot handle the bandwidth. Almost as if they had significantly too little crypto in their reserves and a sudden price hike would mean they didn&amp;amp;#39;t have the time to increase their reserves. Almost as if they were expecting the market to drop further and that gamble didn&amp;amp;#39;t pay off so better bring out the ol &amp;amp;#39;we&amp;amp;#39;re experiencing technical difficulty please stand by.&amp;amp;#39;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

This figure may change quite a bit as it was 85% when I started writing this post and now it&amp;amp;#39;s at 88%. The 122 million figure may change as well as time passes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some simple math of 88% multiplied by 122 million means that approximately 107 million dollars in shorts were liquidated. Take that bears!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At the time of writing, over 50 million dollars were Bitcoin shorts and over 40 million dollars were Ethereum shorts. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The largest single liquidation order happened on Okex - BTC-USDT-SWAP valued at $3.18 million.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the past 24 hours, 54542 traders were liquidated.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is the risk of trading with leverage and the saying &amp;amp;quot;invest only what you can afford to lose&amp;amp;quot; applies the most if you decide to dabble with this strategy.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That&amp;amp;#39;s why I was very pleased to learn today that Kraken has &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kraken.com/proof-of-reserves/?utm_source=content+announcement&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;amp;utm_campaign=por+announcement&amp;amp;amp;utm_content=content+link&amp;amp;amp;j=239745&amp;amp;amp;sfmc_sub=49972818&amp;amp;amp;l=227_HTML&amp;amp;amp;u=3691634&amp;amp;amp;mid=514004678&amp;amp;amp;jb=121&quot;&amp;gt;just launched a new way&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; for their customers to verify, with cryptographic proof, that their tokens are actually in their accounts.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s called &amp;amp;quot;proof of reserves&amp;amp;quot;, and here&amp;amp;#39;s how it works. Twice a year, an auditor takes an anonymized snapshot of all balances held and aggregates them into what is called a Merkle tree, a private database that encapsulates all client balances. Some cryptographic magic happens (the actual operation is quite complicated to go over in this post), and voilà! Users can now verify their balances with a few clicks.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;You don&amp;amp;#39;t have to take Kraken words for granted : they can prove to you they&amp;amp;#39;re actually holding the tokens you bought.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In full disclosure, I have to say that I&amp;amp;#39;ve been a Kraken customer since I started in crypto, so I&amp;amp;#39;m not entirely neutral. However, in my opinion, this kind of practice allows our ecosystem to gain credibility. The days of Mt. Gox and Quadriga are well and truly over!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;First of all no government is perfect there will always be some degree of corruption and wasteful spending. As for actually agreeing with how your government spends money, most people don’t, that’s why there are differing political parties. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Live in a third world dictatorship full of corruption, well fuck pay your taxes anyway so you don’t get arrested. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Most of the sub lives in the United States, a democracy with 538 people fighting on where money is spent every day. If you don’t like it vote differently. I know crypto has a big libertarian base, but your views do not justify cheating the system. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“I’d rather donate the money”, Do it then! Guess what, tax deductions for charities exist if you want to donate your profits. Put your money where your mouth is and stop making excuses&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you hide your crypto profits you are no better than millionaires with offshore accounts&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;wow some of you are incapable of civil discussion and feel the need to insult anyone with a different opinion than you&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The benefits of crypto go far beyond just having it replace Fiat to a degree, there can be dozens of unforeseen benefits even for people who aren&amp;amp;#39;t using crypto and taxes are one of those. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Within hours, a trading desk Jump Capital agreed to replenish the entire amount so that the liquidations calamity is avoided. The loss of the peg due to the hack could have sent the network into cascading liquidations arising out of leveraged positions. In stepped a VC to save the day.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/adhsxhuefqf81.jpg?width=1172&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=7ed759f03c763a7cfd07d8bb35a03cff7aa3921d&quot;&amp;gt;Lost $320m? Thats fine.. we got you covered. &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The fact that VCs are ready to cover these kind of losses shows that the entire Solana &amp;amp;quot;ecosystem&amp;amp;quot; is just one big sham propped up by these same VCs. They dont want their baby to die just yet. Apparently Jump Capital owns a significant stake in Wormhole and is ready to sink such a huge amount to cover losses. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In Solana, the top 1.34% of addresses owns 99% of the circulating supply. Most of the supply was sold to early VCs and insiders at a massive discount to retail. Insiders and bad actors like Chamath have publicly joked about using Solana as a vehicle to play their pumps and dumps out, leaving retail to hold the bags when the sham unfolds. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;VCs dont just sink in $300m to save the day, unless they have already taken out 50x that amount - that is what Solana has enabled them to do already.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So a buncha SOL Shills be like hurr durr even ehtirium had hacks and was saved by fork. Well the DAO hack was solved by cryptography solutions (forking), not by VCs stepping into save the day. If you think both are the same, you clearly understand NOTHING about crypto whatsoever. The DAO hack and the hard fork took over a month to assess, propose solutions and resolve. It wasnt an overnight fix, like what solana is known for. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When Solana goes down - over night fix.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When bridge hacked? - overnight fix. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How long will Solana depend on overnight fixes to bail the network out?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Christ if traditional banking was this flakey the government would haul it over the coals and watch it burn.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yet people still invest in this centralized garbage. Litecoin for example (and I am sure there are many other examples that people can name) has had 100 percent uptime with literally no hacks or exploits, yet people label it as a deadcoin that is garbage.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It brings me to the conclusion that we don&amp;amp;#39;t really care about fundamentals in the crypto space, only juicy profits. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So it brings me back to the original point of this post, why an earth are people investing in SOL when it is the least secure and reliable chain in crypto?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m calling it right now, the metaverse will be a big failure. The only reason the metaverse seems so popular is because of the advertisements and the amount of memes. Nobody is going out of their way to buy an Oculus headset for $400 and try to bid on a house to be snoop doggs neighbors.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Facebook is losing 1 million users daily. It&amp;amp;#39;s very possible that the Facebook Era goes downhill from here on out.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;We expect first quarter 2022 total revenue to be in the range of $27-29 billion, which represents 3-11% year-over-year growth. We expect our year-over-year growth in the first quarter to be impacted by headwinds to both impression and price growth.&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;On the impressions side, we expect continued headwinds from both increased competition for people&amp;amp;#39;s time and a shift of engagement within our apps towards video surfaces like Reels, which monetize at lower rates than Feed and Stories.&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;On the pricing side, we expect growth to be negatively impacted by a few factors:&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;First, we will lap a period in which Apple&amp;amp;#39;s iOS changes were not in effect and we anticipate modestly increasing ad targeting and measurement headwinds from platform and regulatory changes.&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;Second, we will lap a period of strong demand in the prior year and we&amp;amp;#39;re hearing from advertisers that macroeconomic challenges like cost inflation and supply chain disruptions are impacting advertiser budgets.&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;Finally, based on current exchange rates, we expect foreign currency to be a headwind to year-over-year growth.&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So, Apple&amp;amp;#39;s &amp;amp;quot;Ask App not to track&amp;amp;quot; feature has negatively affected Facebook&amp;amp;#39;s ad revenue and ad campaigns as they can&amp;amp;#39;t track these users anymore, steal their data and making money off of targeted ads more efficiently.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And as Zoomers are more into tik tok, reels based ads have lower monetization rate.So, what does Zucc do? Zucc is thinking about creating their own metaverse, kinda like Sandbox or Decentraland, but with actual VR and monetize it by playing ads(Like how people are buying lands in Sandbox and Mana to advertise their business) and stealing more data from users.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is because, they realized, since they will not have a majority chunk of iphone users data which is always a big part of their revenue because majority of the United States use iphone and ad rates are better for Western countries rather than third world countries, Zucc realized he can&amp;amp;#39;t control mobile devices anymore, hence he wants his own Matrix style Dystopian Metaverse with targeted ads.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Facebook has literally shaped how modern society is. The harm what facebook has done and is continuing to due on many fronts to the population is irreversible. Facebook should not be allowed to succeed in it&amp;amp;#39;s Metaverse plans.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Who is CoinShares? A company whose &amp;amp;quot;mission is to expand access to the digital asset ecosystem&amp;amp;quot; - in other words, a company that is dependent on crypto succeeding. If you read the report and you don&amp;amp;#39;t have rose-colored glasses, that becomes obvious for you - even though they pick the numbers most favorable for them, they find that BTC accounts for only 0.08% of CO2 emitted worldwide.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Think about that, that&amp;amp;#39;s almost a thousandth of all CO2 - for something that really isn&amp;amp;#39;t used all that much. That number is huge, and probably even higher in reality.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s a laughable effort of declaring BTCs environmental problems FUD. In a few decades, when we hopefully have mostly solved crypto&amp;amp;#39;s environmental problems, we will look back at studies like that the same way we regard &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.history.com/news/cigarette-ads-doctors-smoking-endorsement&quot;&amp;gt;cigarette ads from the 1930s and 1940s&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; with doctors saying they are not at all bad for your health.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now I don&amp;amp;#39;t know what to do with all this ETH. It&amp;amp;#39;s worth approximately 250 millions USD, which is not bad, if you ask me. Should I stake it all and get the 4% rewards? This way I would get passive income, something like 10 millions USD/year, which is theoritically enough for my family to live a comfortable life. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also, by staking, I would be contributing to the security of the blockchain, which is a big plus for me - I wanna do my part!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But is this the best course of action for me?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I also thought about getting into liquidity pools, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;but I am afraid of smart contract risks&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. What if I put all my ETH into a LP on Solana, and then some asshole comes and drain the contract? I worked very hard for this ETH, that would suck. And there&amp;amp;#39;s also the risk of impermanent loss - what if my ETH on Solana decoupled from the ETH on mainnet?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyway, thanks everyone, and I look forward to read your ideas.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I see a lot of people on this sub saying that crypto is their path to financial freedom, early retirement and a lambo. Many of these people boast a portfolio of up to 100% in crypto. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you don’t have much invested to begin with, let’s say $10,000 or equivalent in your country (which I’m sure is more than a lot of people have in crypto), then you would have to see some out of this world gains to get rich.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What people actually need to do is to invest in themselves, get a good job and funnel some decent earnings into crypto. That being said it needs to be in a proportion that goes with a high risk investment. Other things like property and stocks can’t be overlooked. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sometimes I get the impression people here are selling lemonade out the front of their house and putting $20 into crypto a week expecting to get rich.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Honestly I feel like it’s one of the most overhyped projects on the market especially with other chains like Polygon being MUCH more consistent, cheaper and faster.
At least when Polygon gets DDOSed it doesn’t come to a complete stop like Solana. In fact even with the attack, Polygon still had one of the cheapest fees ok the market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I honestly don’t know why anyone would keep supporting and hyping this chain anymore…&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
