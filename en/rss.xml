&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I really thought we would encounter at least some greater real world usage by now, but atm we only have ponzi like DeFi Apps, NFT that suck all the &amp;amp;quot;usage&amp;amp;quot; and copycats all over the place. I seriously thought crypto would have a better impact by now or at least some useful usage, kinda disappointed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Most tokens feel so useless, a lot are just made for governance, but really how is that decentralized? A centralized system where everyone can only vote once is way more fair than a decentralized governance where the biggest whales dictate everything.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And if they are not only made for governance, they are made for staking/farming aka ponzi like tactics, which is very short term. Most of the DeFi apps can function well without the token and just use the native token they operate on, but the team behind it just wants to milk as much as possible so they create a token and give high APY to make it &amp;amp;quot;useful&amp;amp;quot;. High APY where they give the same token you stake is never going to end well. Don&amp;amp;#39;t ever hold these tokens long term.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then we have all the copycats. If you have one dApp or chain that&amp;amp;#39;s &amp;amp;quot;successful&amp;amp;quot;, everyone is copycatting it. Just look at the amount of EVM compatible smart contract chains, it&amp;amp;#39;s getting out of hand. Or STEPN which attracted a decent chunk of users, got copied straight after and so many more examples...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Pretty much all smart contact chains have the same dApps trying to milk every DeFi user there is. Most unique dApps still come from Ethereum and they all get copied to the cheaper chains.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto projects like STEPN are P2E games, all these games are made for short term. Enjoy the gains while it lasts, because the unlimited high emission is going to kill every P2E game. They also attract a TON of bots, so you pretty much are competing with perfect human like players.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then we have countries that are pretty much dictatorships that &amp;amp;quot;adopt&amp;amp;quot; bitcoin, while in reality they just buy bitcoin with the money they steal from their country. Statistics already show these countries aren&amp;amp;#39;t adopting bitcoin in anyway. Also very funny how you see a posts here in front page about some house being sold for BTC for the first time in a country. Like really? Bitcoin has been around for so long and we are proud because of one single private transaction? Lmao.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So really, what did crypto achieve that&amp;amp;#39;s really something to show off with? Curious to see others opinion.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We&amp;amp;#39;re in a bear market. Shit sucks. But that doesn&amp;amp;#39;t mean we can&amp;amp;#39;t still have some fun right?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For those that were around at the beginning of the year, you might remember that I created this. The FOLIO OF HATE. I invested (yolo&amp;amp;#39;d?) $100 into this subs most hated coins. Some coins are hated because of utility, some because of corruption, some because of the the shills. Whatever the reason, I decided to act on the theory that this sub can actually pick winners by investing into the ones that we all hate the most.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So, $100 was invested on the same day to each of the ten coins/tokens. Here is how it fared.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/nfz7ezwmz8y81.png?width=991&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=d0ac739a8375280fe14e47eb7564c5a1d6d7fc0e&quot;&amp;gt;Folio of Hate&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Down 46% or $460 in five months.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What about the individual results? Surely they&amp;amp;#39;re not all bad? Right?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Best performer:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; USDT -0.01 %&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Worst performer:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; LRC -70.13 %&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Surprise Performer:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; DOGE -31.01%&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/mbx8ck2j09y81.png?width=1007&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=87d85fccc2bb402f75ac9b570a37b9cd73b866ec&quot;&amp;gt;Folio of Hate Individual Performance&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Personal points of interest:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Investing in Dogecoin - yes Dogecoin - was a better investment than Solana, Cardano, Ripple and Binance.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Safemoon was not the predicted worst performer ...yet.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Tether - FUCKING TETHER - was the folios best performer. Props to &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/u/entschida&quot;&amp;gt;u/entschida&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; for getting that one right.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I am aware that perceptions and opinions shift over time, so it is of course possible that we hate these coins more than ever. Oh, and fuck you Crypto.com&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Original post from &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rng996/here_it_is_the_subs_most_despised_coins_combined/&quot;&amp;gt;five months ago&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Well after a long and exhaustive battle of coins being shilled in just a couple of hours, I have found the list of the subs most hated coins. There was definitely a lot of hate out there. I put $100 into each and stored it on a seperate group of wallets to my real bags. To make it easier to track, I create the folio of hate using coinmarketcap to track them more easily. I&amp;amp;#39;ll post the updates every month and hope to see some big gains going against us all (even my most hated coin is in this group).  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There was a lot of hate from users, towards some coins more so than others. The two most hated were the most hated by a very long way. Merry Christmas everyone!  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The final list in order of most votes and comments is listed in the comment below because the filter won&amp;amp;#39;t let me create a post with that many coin names in it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

You can&amp;amp;#39;t associate constant dumps and weak pumps Bitcoin has been going through for the last 4 months as a bull market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Benjamin Cowen is one of the few people I follow and I enjoy his content. It&amp;amp;#39;s sad to him say his theory of lengthening cycles is dead, because it made the most sense. As an asset gets bigger, it obviously takes more money to move it up hence more time. Also, every Bitcoin cycle has seemed like it was progressively getting longer if you measure it from cycle bottoms.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/ym1kycwyl8y81.png?width=595&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=77e259cb883425ccc915974eb75452c90cf84073&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/ym1kycwyl8y81.png?width=595&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=77e259cb883425ccc915974eb75452c90cf84073&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/mc0c80fwm8y81.png?width=589&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=0560ebfc99b268861e9bc617644a307749ff8417&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/mc0c80fwm8y81.png?width=589&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=0560ebfc99b268861e9bc617644a307749ff8417&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What he says makes sense, even if we were to somehow pump up from here it wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t erase all this downwards movement we had to go through. It would be hard to classify the past 2 years as part of the bull market. If the high inflation numbers and the situation with the FED wasn&amp;amp;#39;t a thing, I think his theory would have been correct. What do you think?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s getting ugly out there.
Bitcoin is down over 8% this week and has fallen nearly 50% from last year&amp;amp;#39;s all-time-high. The situation isn&amp;amp;#39;t much better for Ethereum, down 5% over the week, while newer best-of-breed coins like Solana (SOL), Terra (LUNA), and Avalanche (AVAX) fell over 10% this week. Things haven&amp;amp;#39;t looked this bad in a while, and it&amp;amp;#39;s going to get worse before it gets better.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But don&amp;amp;#39;t be alarmed. Like the meme of the dog in a bowler hat sitting in a house on fire: This is fine.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Before getting into why things will be (mostly) fine, let&amp;amp;#39;s take a look at what&amp;amp;#39;s causing crypto to melt down in the first place.
The primary culprit is the global macroeconomy. Governments around the world are being walloped by inflation levels not seen in 40 years, and central banks are finally taking measures—like jacking interest rates and shrinking their balance sheets—to fix this. Unfortunately, this has meant taking away the cheap money punchbowl that has powered decades of surging stock and real estate prices.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The result has been a wipeout in both stocks and crypto (Bitcoin is more closely correlated with the Nasdaq than it&amp;amp;#39;s been in ages) and fear among investors. Meanwhile, other global events—from the war in Ukraine to new Covid lockdowns in China—are fueling further sell-offs and adding to the sense of unease. 
In these circumstances, is it any surprise people are flushing their Shiba Inu tokens? Many crypto enthusiasts, and Bitcoiners in particular, like to believe blockchains will supply an alternative financial reality when the world goes to hell, but it&amp;amp;#39;s clear that&amp;amp;#39;s not (yet) the case. Crypto is as prone to macroeconomic shocks as everything else.
Meanwhile, the crypto industry itself has become a bubble waiting to pop. Pick your example—from the glut of worthless Layer 1 chains to fly-by-night NFTs to Floyd Mayweather&amp;amp;#39;s latest pump-and-dump. There&amp;amp;#39;s a lot money being squandered in stupid ways. That&amp;amp;#39;s fine as long as there are enough &amp;amp;quot;greater fools&amp;amp;quot; out there to buy that garbage, but when the music stops, it&amp;amp;#39;s going to look a lot like the ICO fallout of 2018.
We might be at that stage again now. Paradoxically, though, the current carnage we&amp;amp;#39;re seeing should be cause for optimism.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Since the birth of Bitcoin, the crypto industry has been marked by spectacular booms followed by painful crashes. If history repeats itself—and I&amp;amp;#39;m betting it will—the impending downturn will serve as a healthy cleanse and reboot for the industry.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That&amp;amp;#39;s what happened in 2013 when the price of Bitcoin brushed the once jaw-dropping figure of $1,200, only to plummet afterward. It took years to reach that level again, but in the interim, something remarkable happened: dedicated teams put their heads down and built a series of innovations that transformed the industry. By the time the next boom rolled around in 2016, crypto had gone from being just Bitcoin and a handful of altcoins like Litecoin and XRP to encompass smart contracts, utility tokens, and a multi-chain future.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A similar thing happened after the bust of 2018. When crypto came roaring back in 2021, the technology had changed profoundly. A series of stylish NFT platforms had eclipsed the primitive CryptoKitties of the previous boom, DAOs took off for real, and the entire plumbing of the industry had become far more sophisticated.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s going to happen again. Just as in the past, the dilettantes and hustlers will move to some other shiny thing, while the real crypto believers will stick around to lay the groundwork for the next era of Web3.
It&amp;amp;#39;s hard to predict exactly what this next era will look like, but a good bet is that it will feature low gas fees, easy-to-use Layer 2 options, and NFTs moving to the core of the music and entertainment industries. It&amp;amp;#39;s a
fun future to imagine—provided you have the stomach to get through another Crypto Winter.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Been hearing about Bitcoin since 2009, Thought it&amp;amp;#39;s farmville money. I had a GPU that could mine hundeds of Bitcoin a week in 2011 but I rather played Call of Duty with it. Till 2021, I didn&amp;amp;#39;t give a damn about what Bitcoin is but now it is all I research about (watching Greg Foss for Hopium, What Bitcoin Did for philosophy and money Benjamin Cowen for TA)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Started stacking sats from Jan 2021, flipped some shitcoins, DCA&amp;amp;#39;ed monthly into stacking via the lightning network and finally arrived here.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Used to hold it in a single account ledger wallet, but did not feel safe because of dictionary attacks. So, now HODLing into sparrow multi sig wallet (2 of 2 both Ledger Nano X). Stored my seed phrase safely burned underground in my backyard in a layer of concrete. HODL mode on!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Best of all, its KYC free.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Well, on to the next goal of 2 BTC.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here we are one year later. Since then DOGE only was in a downtrend from 0.70$ to 0.12$. Reasons are the overall Crypto dump but also fading interest and hype in the crypto itself. Which they are even trying to tackle right now with actual development and a roadmap. But this is not about doge. This is about not being too overconfident with your investment.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Being to overconfident will lead you to the blinded HODL. While holding may be a very good strategy in crypto its not always. Some cryptos rise others disappear you have to look into the market to know where your investments are heading.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If your crypto look weak over the longterm you should take the profit or if your crypto has done an unsustainable pump you should take a profit. Taking profit is not bad, it&amp;amp;#39;s smart and wise, also you always have the option to buy low afterwards.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIUrE7Ovm5k&quot;&amp;gt;In the latest Coffeezilla video&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, our intrepid investigator finally confirmed that John Karony, the CEO of Safemoon, definitively owns the infamous &amp;amp;quot;Gabe&amp;amp;quot; wallet - the BSC wallet that ends in &amp;amp;quot;6abe&amp;amp;quot;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I might make a future post about this, but a quick summary is that the Gabe wallet bought a &amp;amp;quot;Moondog&amp;amp;quot; NFT, which John then tweeted about, and also wrote an instagram post about moving it. He also attended Austin SXSW and received an exclusive NFT that is transferred to your wallet for attendees only.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This (among other evidence) was the smoking gun and confirmed John&amp;amp;#39;s ownership of said wallet, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;which was previously highlighted as problematic as it has been receiving millions of dollars from Bitmart which was supposed to be sent to the liquidity pool&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, and yet these funds are being withdrawn as cash or spent on frivolous items.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;hr/&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With that out the way, we know that Karony owns this wallet, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/6zSJko3&quot;&amp;gt;and he received a tip off from the slimy Ben Phillips&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; to buy some shitcoin called &amp;amp;quot;Stonks&amp;amp;quot;.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://bscscan.com/token/0xb966150c7a0150ed4ea979e04f18d109301aab95?a=0xd51d1d5503dcff819e214faa66c3b6f0ebb06abe&quot;&amp;gt;On that same day, Karony bought $150,000 worth of Stonks&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, becoming the 2nd largest token holder.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Unfortunately, John&amp;amp;#39;s investing savvy is secondly only to his FUD-fighting savvy, and his FUD-fighting savvy is fucking awful, and so I regret to say that his $150,000 worth of Stonks tokens are now... alas...  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;$5,107.46..&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;That&amp;amp;#39;s a 96.6% loss.&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;hr/&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If this was his own money, who gives a shit. But to actually misuse taxed funds from investors which was supposed to go into the liquidity pool to help secure price stability of Safemoon, in order to buy cringey worthless NFT&amp;amp;#39;s and hundreds of thousands of dollars of shit tokens is a new low.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Especially considering Safemoon currently has a very serious liquidity issue. With just over $6m in BNB liquidity left, it only takes a couple whales to drain the LP and slam the door shut on everyone else.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A bank run is a comin&amp;amp;#39;!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I&amp;amp;#39;m getting pretty tired of our little market. There&amp;amp;#39;s so much that is just so rediculous.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For starters, wasn&amp;amp;#39;t the whole point to get away from the mainstream markets and banks? Now here we are, directly correlated to the moves of the stock market, driven by bots, Wall Street bankers and big finance whales.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And while we have such a tiny market cap, so much money is diverted into an entirely seperate market that recently blew up, NFT&amp;amp;#39;s. How much retail interest that otherwise would have gone into crypto&amp;amp;#39;s longer term was wasted on the NFT market by buying shitty JPG&amp;amp;#39;s of monkeys and rocks with laser eyes? What the hell were crypto people thinking promoting that BS other than trying to make a quick buck off the backs of ignorant retailers? If people had any forsight, that interest and limited funds would have been much better used in crypto projects. And that new retail would have been much better off for it too. Sure, many would have left with the market downturn, but many would have held too. But now all that new interest has been wasted by getting burned by a (so far) shitty use case in a side-market that&amp;amp;#39;s &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/nft-sales-plummet-92-market-133403653.html&quot;&amp;gt;down over 90%&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. A large percentage of whom never entered the crypto market itself.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And then there&amp;amp;#39;s all the news driven BS and shitty meme coins. Doge coin? Shiba inu? Are you f*cking kidding me? Meme BS like that does nothing but damage the markets credibility, and again ... divert limited funds away from legitimate projects.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And we&amp;amp;#39;re entirely dependent on people like Elon Musk (who I like, but that doesn&amp;amp;#39;t change the fact that the market depending on his involvement is rediclulous), that something-something-Miller guy, Saylor, Kwon, ... Since when do we care what a few rich folks do? As retail we have the power to move the market. Too many people are just wasting their money on shitty NFT&amp;amp;#39;s and futures trading, rather than buying spot.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s sad to see this market turn into such a joke and be entirely at the behest of Wall Street ...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hell I still remember back in 2018 everyone was bemoaning the fact that the entire market was tied to the price of Bitcoin. Now here we are, not only still tied to Bitcoin but to the stock market too. What a sad joke.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Grow up. Be the change you want to see. See people about to waste their money on NFT&amp;amp;#39;s? Slap them. Thinking about participating in the futures market? Stick with spot. Thinking about shorting? Don&amp;amp;#39;t, just buy the dips. See news about Elon, Saylor or Kwon? Don&amp;amp;#39;t give a f*. Just DCA, stake, build, whatever it takes. Invest only what you can afford to miss for the long run and ignore the short term noise. This is the only place a lot of us see as an alternative to the old world. A potential for escape from all the control and restrictions. The endless boomer politicians sticking their grubby paws into everything. And however small we are as individuals, as a whole, we &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;can&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; move markets and change things. In more ways than one. We need an alternative system and so far, this is the best one we&amp;amp;#39;ve got. Don&amp;amp;#39;t waste it or let the old world shake you out and undermine it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you&amp;amp;#39;ve made a bad decision, and have to accept a negative outcome it&amp;amp;#39;s worth aknowledging that to move on. Alot of people struggle with this.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;No more blaming outside parties, or us against them. Blocking out all criticism. Putting more and more faith into delusional utopian outcomes. Going into the whole &amp;amp;quot;well at least we aren&amp;amp;#39;t X project&amp;amp;quot; and so, so much more.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;No one likes being made a fool of, and no one likes to admit they were ignorant in their choices. Yet it is something that needs to be done to wake up to the reality of the situation and make the decisions that need to be done. Dwelling on a dead or dying project is only going to hold you back.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As stated numerous times on this subreddit. Everyone wants to be the $500 to $100k holder as that&amp;amp;#39;s what everyone hears about. No one wants to be the $1000 to $0.01 holder, yet a majority of us will be and we will need to accept that when it happens.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is your call to make as you are the person who holds yourself back or pushes yourself forward. Choose wisely.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then in 2022 … Bitcoin went below $40K and everyone thought that the Digital Gold is gone forever&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I am not telling you to buy or sell, I am not telling how much to invest or or what to invest in, I am just telling you the history and don’t worry if you are true believer of crypto and the project you choose to invest in&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also, I can‘t wait to buy more cheap Bitcoin in 2026 when it goes below $400K and everyone is thinking it’s gone forever&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Minting their “Otherdeeds” cost 305 APE and generated over $550 million in sales in the first day all on the hope that they’re going to do something interesting with virtual real estate. I don’t get why the vast majority of the hype is around virtual real estate NFTs when there are several projects already doing stuff with &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;real life&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; real estate via NFTs.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I learned about these Web3 real estate projects recently and they seem so much more tangible than most metaverse projects. It’s not like Web3 real estate projects are immune to issues. Balcony DAO, Propy, CitaDAO, etc. all have their issues and I’m not going to pretend like they don’t. DeFi is the future but there are a lot of kinks that will have to be worked out. But I continue to be surprised that so much hype and money goes towards virtual real estate on the expectation that &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;maybe someday&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; these virtual spaces will have enough users rather than going towards projects focused on real buildings that people really need to live in and can produce income from.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If anyone is curious, here’s some of the real estate NFT projects that seem most interesting (in alphabetical order):&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.balconydao.com/&quot;&amp;gt;Balcony DAO&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;: This is in the early stages but they’re one of the most interesting ones.  Their goal is to take major real estate investment opportunities (think residential skyscrapers) that are normally inaccessible to the average investor and turn them into investing opportunities for regular people via NFTs. They have a fully doxxed team with founders who are well known and respected in the real estate space.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://citadao.io/&quot;&amp;gt;CitaDAO&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;: They want real estate to be tokenized and transacted on chain. One of their focal points is steady rental income from their projects. They’re starting with property in England and their process involves staking USDC in a pool. Their initial fundraising effort failed to capture enough revenue, falling about 30% short of the total they needed, but still felt like a good proof of concept for the DAO. They still have future plans to pursue another IRO (Introducing Real Estate On-chain) round.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lofty.ai/&quot;&amp;gt;Lofty AI&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;: They’re a startup where you can buy shares in tokenized rental properties. Shares can go as low as $50 so the ceiling for involvement is very low. They’re similar to existing projects like Fundrise and Roofstock but they have a lower bar for entry.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://propy.com/&quot;&amp;gt;Propy&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;: Propy is maybe the most well known player in this space. Their focus is on normal real estate transactions in the Web3 world. Instead of buying or selling your house through normal means, you can trade it like an NFT. They claim to have sold the world’s first real estate NFT.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I can safely say that i am certainly sure I have addiction issues with crypto. As it is, quite literally like gambling.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I loved the highs, but frankly I have only begun to dig my own grave by the amount of lows I&amp;amp;#39;ve been through. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bad decision making, thinking &amp;amp;quot;yeah this&amp;amp;#39;ll work out&amp;amp;quot; and being a fucking gambling addicted idiot.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I have sold the last but of my crypto, and I am genuinely done. I&amp;amp;#39;ve gone through to many sleepless nights of uncertainty, too many days of overthinking. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I am out. Goodbye fellas.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;PS: Don&amp;amp;#39;t get into crypto if you have:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A) an addictive personality
B) have mental health issues
C) think it&amp;amp;#39;s smart to invest money you actually need&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
