&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If anyone listened to Powell speak, he hinted towards a US Stable coin in 2023.   Most likely will bring regulation to all other stable coins and crack down on them.  I’m pretty sure everyone here knows Tether isn’t fully backed and it’s a matter of time before the house of cards falls.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This isn’t fud, just trying to help some people out there.  No need to sell your BTC, ETH or any other projects you believe in.  But be very cautious with yields and stable coins.  Ideally it’s best to hold your own coins in cold storage.  Keep stacking&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The large wick to 17.6k had indeed caused a ton of damage and a lot of people to actually sell. The realized losses, meaning actual losses after people sell, have reached about $22.67 billion and is likely even over $23 billion as we are speaking.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Is this a bottom signal? No, definitely not but this just shows how brutal this crash has been so far you can very well argue that this has been worse than 2018 and makes the 2021 may correction look like literally nothing. And in this environment it is definitely remarkable how many are still here.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We may get to $40b realized losses or more. But all that matters is that you don&amp;amp;#39;t get caught by paper hands and sell yourself. Of course we very likely won&amp;amp;#39;t hit a new ATH this year. But as Crypto has shows in the past that patience is key.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There is so much arrogance when money is flowing, a lot of people are wrongly assuming that people in crypto all have the personna of a Do Kwon/Justin Sun/The other weirdo who think he was Satoshi(I forgot his name).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Until I actually looked at the data.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While there was indisputably some positive effect of having extra cash on the market, numbers showed that the effect wasn&amp;amp;#39;t as big as you would expect. Nor was it even what triggered the bull market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Why wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t over $5 Trillion of extra cash not have a profound impact on Bitcoin and the crypto market?&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Keep in mind, the full $5 Trillion didn&amp;amp;#39;t go into stimulus checks, much less into crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Only $1.8T went to individuals.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The rest went to healthcare, local government, airline industry, businesses, etc...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Something that would maybe still help stocks more, but not so much crypto  (at the time, the correlation to stocks still wasn&amp;amp;#39;t strong, around 0.4-0.5).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Even the $1.8T didn&amp;amp;#39;t all go to stimulus checks. A big part went to Child tax credits, SNAP, unemployment, retirement.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/11/us/how-covid-stimulus-money-was-spent.html&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/11/us/how-covid-stimulus-money-was-spent.html&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;$817B went to stimulus checks.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;What percentage of the stimulus checks actually went into crypto?&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;According to Mizuho research, about 10% of stimulus recipient planned on investing their check in stocks or crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yahoo.com/video/nearly-10-of-the-380-billion-in-stimulus-checks-may-be-used-to-buy-bitcoin-and-stocks-survey-131009531.html&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.yahoo.com/video/nearly-10-of-the-380-billion-in-stimulus-checks-may-be-used-to-buy-bitcoin-and-stocks-survey-131009531.html&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Mizuho has estimated that the amount used from stimulus check would only have added about a 2-3% to the market value of Bitcoin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;What was happening to Bitcoin before Covid, and did Covid and Fed printing trigger the bull run?&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One of the first problems I ran into with this theory, is Bitcoin was already at the beginning of a bull market, and had already made its turning point, before any of the stimulus checks, or before Covid became a big world issue.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/aazxmafqge791.jpg?width=1788&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=111c221e82f6d7859d354c3d58de342b33dd7a97&quot;&amp;gt;Turning point for Bitcoin, beginning of bull market, and Covid interruption&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Stimulus checks didn&amp;amp;#39;t trigger the bull market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The bearish and selling pressure had already been exhausted, already reverted to bullish and buying pressure, already had a breakout, and already had its first parabolic run to $13K. Which had already corrected, and the resuming bull trend got interrupted with the Covid crash.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;The actual timeline of the stimulus checks versus the price of Bitcoin.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the following chart are the zones where the stimulus started to hit people&amp;amp;#39;s accounts.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Direct deposits are yellow, mailed checks are orange.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s in &amp;amp;quot;zones&amp;amp;quot; because not everyone got their checks instantly or at the same time. There were also waves, delays, etc...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Keep in mind, there would likely be additional time between the time those funds are received, and the time they can actually be traded on an exchange, especially if they have to open their first account.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/tpxt0245he791.jpg?width=1541&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=a3f51200f2bfb45246c73a66930c0db3e24de6c6&quot;&amp;gt;First stimulus check distribution&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/76eb4hjbhe791.jpg?width=1890&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=2c390383b9f16cebe85c8dcecdb697c75e971463&quot;&amp;gt;Second stimulus check distribution&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/dvfy5w79he791.jpg?width=1890&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e89c99f58dc4a41551e987b9e33d0fbd9f8f0342&quot;&amp;gt;Third stimulus check distribution&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All 3 distributions are followed by a downtrend.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The difference is in the 3rd distribution, there is crabbing throughout most of the distribution, followed by a crash.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Research has found that the stimulus checks may have only affected Bitcoin trading by an estimated 3.8%&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;According to the research done about stimulus checks, by the Federal Reserve Bank, only 0.02% of all the Cares Act fund distributed went into Bitcoin, with only an estimated 3.8% increase in trading resulting from the stimulus money.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/newsroom-and-events/publications/working-papers/2021-working-papers/wp-2113-impact-of-covid19-stimulus-checks-on-retail-trading-in-bitcoin.aspx&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/newsroom-and-events/publications/working-papers/2021-working-papers/wp-2113-impact-of-covid19-stimulus-checks-on-retail-trading-in-bitcoin.aspx&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;3.8% is still impactful, but probably nowhere near as high as people would have expected. Much less the source of the majority of the trading.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;The true effect of the stimulus checks.&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The stimulus checks still had some effect.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But not so much in creating or increasing the bull market, but in compensating and decreasing the negative macros and fears of the Covid crisis.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The market was in high fear of businesses closing, and going into a bear market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The stimulus checks wiped out a lot of that fear.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The effect didn&amp;amp;#39;t come so much from the stimulus checks going into crypto, as the data shows, but came more in a psychological way in wiping out the fear of a bear market from the Covid crisis, just enough to allow the crypto bull market to resume.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The stimulus check didn&amp;amp;#39;t add much money or liquidity to crytpo, but it kept average Joe from running out of money, and removed the pitfall of Covid, to allow the crypto bull market to continue to run free and unimpeded.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;According to &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.coinbase.com/the-rise-of-crypto-in-higher-education-81b648c2466f&quot;&amp;gt;this study&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; from 2018 (surely the number is higher currently), 42% of top 50 universities offer a course in blockchain or cryptocurrencies.  Here&amp;amp;#39;s a list of schools offering courses in crypto that I know of or was able to find with a quick search, in no particular order. If you know of any more, please comment and I&amp;amp;#39;ll add it to the list. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

You can check the data of previous crashes and make some conclusions. This is not advice, but if you’re in the group that thinks that “history repeats itself” it could be a good idea to wait a few months until the stock market and the crypto market dumps again and find a better enter position.
On the other side, I think that is not a bad idea to start a DCA strategy since we are really low in prices right now, specially BTC and ETH. I’m sure they will dump in the future, but maybe not enough to try to time the bottom.
Anyways, this year can be a great opportunity to buy if you believe in crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

This is always laughed at by people saying how bi-polar it is in here. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However, like everything in social media, I believe there are agendas from bots/paid actors, multi accounts that deliberately push to sentiment here in a bullish/bearish direction for their financial gain. They could be either shorting or going long with heavy positions. When the market shifts directions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I have never interacted with so many experts that say crypto is dead now, and only meant for scams/ponzis - the tech is all BS. I also have received many downvotes for stating that crypto, mainly BTC is fine and will rebound - but when crypto is climbing, its filled with upvotes. This heavy sentiment shift leads me to believe there is an agenda to attack indecisive investor emotions to either sell or buy, so they can profiit.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So don&amp;amp;#39;t forget, when there are profits to made that can leverage off the public, the people you are talking to here or other platforms with their crypto advice could actually just be trying to move the market in one direction. In other words they could ultimately believe in BTC but just want to talk crap so you sell, and they scoop up more cheap BTC.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Stick to your plan no matter what people say who just want you to follow the sentiment.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Voyager&amp;amp;#39;s exposure to 3AC consists of 15,250 BTC and $350 million USDC. The Company made an initial request for a repayment of $25 million USDC by June 24, 2022, and subsequently requested repayment of the entire balance of USDC and BTC by June 27, 2022. Neither of these amounts has been repaid, and failure by 3AC to repay either requested amount by these specified dates will constitute an event of default. Voyager intends to pursue recovery from 3AC and is in discussions with the Company&amp;amp;#39;s advisors regarding the legal remedies available. The Company is unable to assess at this point the amount it will be able to recover from 3AC&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Few hours back just out of curiosity I tried leverage on Binance.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I started with 78 USDT and used leverage of 3x with BTC, voila I made a profit of few dollars and felt like a king. I increased the leverage to 5x and the winning streak continued. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Next, I leveraged with Ethereum and leveraged 10x and it was wonderful. I was feeling on the top of the world, nothing could stop me. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After first timers luck the degen ape in me woke up and I leveraged 25x on ShibaInu and the house of cards came falling in front of me. All of my profit from earlier trades was wiped out and my capital of 78 USDT decimated to 50 USDT. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I was hysterical and went all in on Shiba again with leverage of 50x and recovered my loss and made a mind boggling profit of 5 USDT.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My take from my experiment with leverage : &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Don&amp;amp;#39;t leverage, Don&amp;amp;#39;t play with futures, it is very demanding.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;You will be constantly checking prices/profit or loss.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;It is addictive and this gambling can ruin you financially. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;My mental peace was gone and I was barely able to sleep for 2 hours and even in my sleep I was dreaming about charts.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;conclusion - Don&amp;amp;#39;t leverage / play with future else it will destroy your future. If you want to do it properly follow stop-loss.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Given that we are going to get diminishing returns and still get bear markets of -70 or more,  does HODL truly make sense?  We’ve officially reached the cycle where the diminishing returns are so apparent that we breached previous ATH.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It seems that the smartest strategy is to buy in the bear market and sell your whole stack in the bull run.   Obviously you won’t catch the top or bottom but it’s a better way to preserve your capital.   Will you be DCA’ing in the next bull run once/if we break 70k?   I just hate how taking profits it’s frowned in this community and ppl are encouraged to HODL which is a penny stock promoter scam tactic.  To each their own.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m sure bitcoin still has big bull runs in its future but I don&amp;amp;#39;t see any evidence of what libertarian hard-core crypto people claim about it happening.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Ultimately though I think much of the massive money that gets put in by whales is to pump up the market and eventually cash a lot out when it gets big enough, and leaves retailers in many cases screwed over. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The new CEO of Tether. We are a Multi Billion dollar company. That&amp;amp;#39;s at least four zeros in our net worth. But not before a decimal place&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I know that the cryptocurrency space has been generally weary weary of us. Despite us doing audits from people that &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;we&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; trust.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Look. It was hard for us to back the asset 1:1 with a dollar. That shit is mad worthless these days. We did so initially. And it was the plan. But you know, things happen.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But we have heard you guys out. You guys want to know WHAT our tokens are backed by. You DON&amp;amp;#39;T want it backed by &amp;amp;quot;commercial paper&amp;amp;quot; and other fun things. We will do an &amp;amp;quot;actual&amp;amp;quot; audit soon. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is why we shall just swap all 70 billion USDT with DAI, which IS backed by US dollars. Doing some simple math,&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;USDT = DAI = USD&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;USDT = USD&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Ask me anything&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Bitcoin dominance will consolidate and is already creeping above 70% in terms of volume.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As someone who first bought bitcoin in a barnes and noble off localbitcoins in 2013, I consider myself a Bitcoin Maxi — but I would be lying if I didn’t say that my biggest gains haven’t come from altcoins. Remember that ether itself was once considered a shitcoin. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Historically, here are the two best things you can do during crypto winter:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;DCA into bitcoin&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Study and pick your alts.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Many coins that were by no means unknown in 2018 went on to produce 10-100x gains. Here are some prices for reference on Dec 22, 2017 — right after Bitcoin fell 30% over the course of two days (sound familiar?)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;BNB: $5.54&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Link: $0.57&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;KuCoin: $0.88&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now, one of the bad things about the crypto industry is that people try to it make more complicated than it needs to be. Bitcoin needs a white paper; Floki Shiba Inu Monkey Pox coin doesn’t. This is why I wrote an &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bitscrypto.com/cryptos&quot;&amp;gt;ELI5 Description of Every Coin on Coinbase&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. A few well placed investments into the right alts while dollar cost averaging into BTC/ETH has historically been the best bear market strategy — and there is no reason to think this time around is any different.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Even more important than picking the right alts is to &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;set up a DCA strategy and stick to it&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. I like to keep my crypto investments proportional to how much money I’m actually spending day to day, so I actually wrote myself an ios/android app that rounds up my everyday purchases and invests the spare change into my coinbase portfolio. This is a strategy I’ve been employing for a few years now, but only just recently made the code user friendly enough to be used by strangers and added a “boost” setting so you can ramp investments up and down with spending. I made it free with no current monetization plan (it’s in the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://9u9hu.app.link/e/view&quot;&amp;gt;app store&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, so reviewed by Apple/Google).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
