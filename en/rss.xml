&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I considered dumping everything into crypto. Taking out leverage. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But I didn&amp;amp;#39;t because this sub would have posts from vets saying - dont do that. Warning that crypto winters are coooold and hard. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So I DCAed in. I avoided alt coins. I didnt spend more than I can afford to lose. I diversified into energy stocks. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now its the end of the world - and I feel fine! No leverage so my crypto can sit there. I have cash so I dont need to panic sell. Im actually getting ready to buy when we truly hit the bottom! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So thanks to all the gloomy bastards who spent the last two years warning to be careful - I was ready for this shit show because of you.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Why not spend a little more time paying attention to the economy in the short-term, so you can make proactive decisions about your investments? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here&amp;amp;#39;s a bit of reality for all you genius apes.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The fed meeting is tomorrow and its going to be a .75 basis point hike.  First time since 1994.  Some of this is already baked into markets (I&amp;amp;#39;m assuming you&amp;amp;#39;ve realized by now that your stocks are down almost 10% and crypto is down 30% since Friday), but there is always more room to drop and more pain to come. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A lot more.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When JP pulls a switcheroo from .5 to .75 a mere 36 hours before the Fed meeting, you had better bed your ass that he&amp;amp;#39;ll open up the doors for more hikes at .75.  And he should.  A CPI at 8.6 is bonkers with a base funds rate of 1.5%.  It&amp;amp;#39;s borderline economic catastrophe.  Since the invention of the dollar, rate hikes have only successfully brought down inflation once they got within 2.5% of the inflation rate.  Get your calculator out bc that means if the inflation rate were to stay at 8.7 (yea right) it would take 6 more rate hikes to get us in the functional range. When he says that &amp;amp;quot;we are now considering .75 rate hikes in July and September, possibly higher&amp;amp;quot; you had better believe people are going to trade whatever they can for cold hard cash.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And that&amp;amp;#39;s not all.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You&amp;amp;#39;ve probably heard of Quantitative &amp;amp;quot;Easing&amp;amp;quot;.  That&amp;amp;#39;s how the Fed &amp;amp;quot;prints&amp;amp;quot; money into existence. They create the money on a magic computer and use it to purchase treasuries and mortgage-backed securities (those bundles of mortgages you heard Christian Bale and Steve Carrell talking so much about in The Big Short).  The Fed bought 3 boatloads of this stuff in 2008 (these purchases are referred to as the &amp;amp;quot;bailouts&amp;amp;quot;), and up to now they&amp;amp;#39;ve got about $8,500,000,000,000 worth.  That&amp;amp;#39;s trillion, with a T. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now we get to play a new game.  Quantitative &amp;amp;quot;Tightening&amp;amp;quot;.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Starting tomorrow (Wednesday for anyone late to the party), the Fed will sell $45,000,000,000 in assets onto the open market.  That&amp;amp;#39;s going to be a whole lot of pressure on markets to stay up and we all know people aren&amp;amp;#39;t exactly buying-hand-over-fist right now.  Their purpose is to bring markets down.  That, by definition, is fighting inflation.  Remember: price up = bad.  Price down = good.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But the QT fun doesn&amp;amp;#39;t end there.  The Fed is going to sell another $45 billion in assets in July, and another $45B in August.  Then, they will increase the rate to $95 BILLION EVERY MONTH starting in September.  At that rate of monthly selling they won&amp;amp;#39;t run out of MBS for 7.5  years.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Let&amp;amp;#39;s talk about those mortgage-backed securities for a second. Those bundles of thousands of mortgages we call MBS start out when you buy a house. Or when your cousin buys a condo to rent on Airbnb.  Remember when you finally closed on your house and 2 days later you received a letter saying that your loan was purchased by another lender?  &amp;amp;quot;Underwriting&amp;amp;quot; is your lender making sure there is a buyer ready and willing to buy this loan the moment you close on the property.  That&amp;amp;#39;s why you get the notice right away.  As you were figuring out to whom you should make your mortgage payment that new lender was bundling your loan with many others to sell yet again to a bigger bank.  The bundle grows each time and at some point they refer to them as MBS, and for some reason they are considered much more secure than individual mortgages.  They are given ratings like A, BB, CCC, etc.  Picture Ryan Gosling playing jenga.  Now when the biggest MBS customer not only stops buying but starts dumping MBS onto the market, you can imagine the demand for these bundles of joy will shift.  Soon smaller banks can&amp;amp;#39;t sell to bigger banks as easily as before. And eventually not at all.  This past Friday the market for MBS actually hit &amp;amp;quot;zero bids&amp;amp;quot; for the first time since 2008 (you might have seen a tweet from the actual Michael Burry).  As loans become harder to sell, will also become harder to write.  And we know what that will do to the housing market.  Remember: price down = good.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now you&amp;amp;#39;re getting it.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Lastly, because my legs are asleep, you need to understand that most of the money that came into crypto since 2017 was not from people here on reddit.  Many of them do not share your diamond hands conviction, and their crypto investment doesn&amp;amp;#39;t represent an &amp;amp;quot;inflation hedge&amp;amp;quot;.  It represents the riskiest thing they&amp;amp;#39;ve ever done with their money.  Ever. Big risk = big reward.  And when both the stock market and the housing market get tumultuous, risk assest get sold first.  That is what you are starting to see. An almost perfect correlation between crypto and the Nasdaq, just where the swings in crypto gains and losses are exaggerated. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Unfortunately we are probably one or two cycles away from certain cryptos being seen and used like the scarce resource inflation hedge that they really are.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So here you are, with all this new knowledge and a bag of Shitcoin Potpourri.  And there is a train coming tomorrow that will last until at least through September.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Good luck!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The relative strength index (RSI) is a momentum indicator used in technical analysis that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions in the price of a stock or other asset. An asset is usually considered overbought when the RSI is above 70% and oversold when it is below 30%.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The RSI will rise as the number and size of positive closes increase, and it will fall as the number and size of losses increase. The second part of the calculation smooths the result, so the RSI will only near 100 or 0 in a strongly trending market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Going on the Weekly charts only, as this is a very long term outlook. Not even the Daily provides this broad of a perspective.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In 2011, just two years after the birth of Bitcoin, the weekly RSI was at 21. The price of bitcoin was $2.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In January 2015, it hit 27. Price was $154.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In December 2019, it hit 29. Price was $3150.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These levels are all textbook oversold values. In the past, every single time it hit these condition levels, it went back to 50 points over the next ~6 months, and hovered around that price for most of that time. After that, it has never again returned to those prices.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Right now, it is at 26, and this is the most oversold it has been in 11 years. I am buying for the next six months. Merry Christmas.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Could it be them just sending their lender more collateral?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I don&amp;amp;#39;t know how that&amp;amp;#39;s handled, but it&amp;amp;#39;s getting close to the level where they are supposed to post more collateral...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In other news...Michael Saylor posted this on twitter, “MicroStrategy has a $205M term loan and needs to maintain $410M as collateral. MSTR has 115,109 BTC that it can pledge. If the price of BTC falls below $3,562 the company could post some other collateral”.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Panic sells off the back of 10% market drops seem like yesterday.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Memories of maximizing apps followed by panic shrieking hair tugging still as clear as day.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Middle of the night portfolio checking, trawling the web for hint&amp;amp;#39;s of good news and sympathizing with fellow redditors losing their shirts.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Months pass... then you realize that somewhere along the way you it appears you have developed a military grade calmness in the face of  obliteration.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A flippant fearlessness that sees the folio figures updating to highlight a 20% loss... closely followed by thoughts of &amp;amp;quot; I wonder whats for dinner&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Browsing net, mainstream media outlets running stories proclaiming another nail in the crypto coffin...closely followed by... shit, better let the dog out for a crap.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Somewhere along your epic crypto journey it seems you&amp;amp;#39;ve developed a superhuman anti-fud kill switch, enabling you to desensitize you&amp;amp;#39;re inner fears in an instant.     &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;No longer are you just calm... you&amp;amp;#39;re crypto calm and frankly with a long-term goal in mind... just couldn&amp;amp;#39;t give a fuck.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Edit&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fun Fact: At pixel o&amp;amp;#39;clock the No-Fuck-O-Meter of 2018 (241 ups) has been surpassed in 2022 after just over an 1hr!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Even people who used to be bullish.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/dd587er72i591.jpg?width=360&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=5222a022b79e765365f90c1d0da53e85be4a27f8&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/dd587er72i591.jpg?width=360&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=5222a022b79e765365f90c1d0da53e85be4a27f8&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The confidence in the market and in the price holding up has faltered. And now it&amp;amp;#39;s no longer &amp;amp;quot;we&amp;amp;#39;ll probably crab at $30K&amp;amp;quot; or &amp;amp;quot;$28K still has good support&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That has changed to &amp;amp;quot;I&amp;amp;#39;m just waiting for the drop below $20K&amp;amp;quot; or &amp;amp;quot;it might even dip below $10K&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And how many times has the suicide hotline been posted now? I almost know the number by heart now.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/6rj1tagtuf591.jpg?width=1896&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=9361989a2d19f3d6eb29a176e46e84079dfd1b81&quot;&amp;gt;Here&amp;amp;#39;s what the last capitulation looked like.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I remember when we dropped below $4k in 2018.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While it&amp;amp;#39;s beginning to smell a lot like the same capitulation, this doesn&amp;amp;#39;t mean it&amp;amp;#39;s the full bottom yet.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It was reeking capitulation when we dropped below $4K, and we still continued all the way to $3.2K. But at the same time, the drop was fueled by a Bitcoin selloff from the Hash war.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We aren&amp;amp;#39;t fueled by any huge sell-off from a Hash war this time. But there is the fuel from inflation fears, and a little of CEL fear added to that.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And a better log chart, shows that if we follow 2018, we probably still have a tiny bit more bottom to make.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/knv7almjvf591.jpg?width=1380&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=27088843452ab3137959f8c24ec8bac2aabe8253&quot;&amp;gt;Log chart comparison of capitulations, with moving average ribbon.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When we capitulated in 2018, it seemed like the drop was never gonna end. Any optimism was gone. Even when we dropped below $3.5K, people were talking about &amp;amp;quot;it will probably go lower than $3K&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Even bulls were saying that.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In fact the difference between bulls and bears, is bulls believed it would drop to only $2K, while bears believed it would drop to $200.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Today, it&amp;amp;#39;s starting to look like we have 2 camps: the bulls who believe the bottom will be somewhere below $20K...maybe around $15k. And the bears who believe it will go even lower than $10K.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But let&amp;amp;#39;s not forget about one important thing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The market movers, the whales, big players, with their quants and bots, are still playing the market, and they are still interested in making money. And just like after every major crash we&amp;amp;#39;ve had in the past, there is a period of accumulation. Because people never run out of desire to make money, especially not in this crazy and volatile market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Volatility and chaotic markets offer the biggest opportunity to make money. And right now, this one is deep in fear and with lots of blood on the street.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And perhaps, like the stock market, everyone is holding their breath right now for one little thing: whether this week, Jerome Powell will talk about .50 or .75 basis points.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That could be the difference in how bloody the rest of June will be. And if crypto will go much lower or not.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I actually paused mine on Friday because of Gemini stopping free withdrawals, which turned out to be a bit of a lucky break because of this weekend crash, but I might start back up again at the end of this week on a different platform.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At this point in time, though, people would probably be better off keeping an eye on global equities news rather than crypto news. This thing won&amp;amp;#39;t get any better until the macro stuff is sorted out.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;EDIT:In other news, Bitcoin dominance actually fell today, which is surprising. But Bitcoin + stablecoin dominance went UP. Maybe this crypto winter is the one where BTC.D stays below 60% because people are keeping their money into USDC and DAI instead.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Everything in the crypto market is propped up by this shady stablecoin, yes even Btc. I think if it somehow collapsed then all things considered, we maybe actually have a scenario where crypto very briefly hits pre 2017-2018 bull market prices.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In that sense it would truly be a once in a lifetime to get many alts like Eth, Monero and perhaps even super cheap Btc.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is not fud, do your DD and you’ll come to the same conclusion.   Store your BTC on a ledger and if you have any money in tether get it out immediately.  It’s not a matter of if it’s a matter of when tether collapses.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yes it is. Go do it. Celsius closing withdrawals is just the tip of the ice berg.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Things can get much worse or better from here, who knows. But you have control over your own coins is better regardless rather than being robbed by an exchange going through a liquidity crisis.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Familiarize yourself with ledger or whatever your preferred wallet is and you’ll realize that it’s not that hard to move things back and forth if you want to sell or buy when the time is right. But that peace of mind is unmatched.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Do it. Your seriously kidding yourself if you think the exchanges wouldn’t sacrifice you to save their sinking ship&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Are you thinking about tapping out? Cool. Nobody is gonna judge you. We all need to eat from time to time.
But you missed the golden rule of investment and I&amp;amp;#39;m not gonna say it here ... Every comment is about the veterans  telling the newbies what they should have done... but greed is a human flaw.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;King Solomon supposedly said it first:
This too shall pass.
I told myself the same when we reached 50k last year and started saving for the rainy days.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We need bad times to appreciate the good times.
The only question is ... Is your bag full of solid tokens that can stand the test of time like Bitcoin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Personal opinion: I&amp;amp;#39;m not buying anything untill we are under 20k. If we never come that low again it&amp;amp;#39;s also a win for me. I don&amp;amp;#39;t need the money I put in.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
