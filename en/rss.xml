&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Dear EU parliament member, &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As counterintuitive as it might sound, proof of work network such as bitcoin is acting as a value generating load balancer in many countries, allowing renewable energy to be developed at a higher speed. As we need to become more independent from Russian gas, renewable incentives are ever more important.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To illustrate the above in a very simplified way, please consider this: Electricity usage of a country is not constant, we could build renewable generators for median usage and supplement with gas and oil at peak hours, or we could build for peak usage, and let excess energy at off peak hours goes into proof-of-work. This shorten the return on investment significantly and give us a way to build enough capacity for tomorrow.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Further data:
- Global gas flaring (thrown away energy) can power 5.5 time the Bitcoin network
- Renewable curtailment (thrown away potential energy at off peak hours) in China alone can run 80% of the Bitcoin network

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Please ask the ECON Committee to oppose Amendments ALT A and ALT G. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is important for the future of renewable, energy innovations and energy independence in Europe&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Kind regards&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Buying a lot of Cardano before the launch of smart contracts.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Trying to time the market to make profit from Doge/Shib by rumors&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thinking day trading is easy money lying on the floor.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Buying too many different coins instead of investing in a few good ones.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Panic selling/buying&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But I guess those can be summarized to our favorite buy high sell low and believing rumors/upcoming news.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yes, there are many other options for example buy Bitcoin, a property or YOLO all in shitcoin but given the overall uncertainty of world politics and high inflation, it could be a great way to live from your savings!?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I mean you could chose a few different platforms and stake a 100k on each platform just in case they go bust.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Given you can easily get 10-12% in returns, it would be a very attractive option. Or do I miss anything?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Let me explain:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There have been three different Bitcoin symbols in use since its inception. The original one was designed by Satoshi and looked &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/Bitcoin_old.png&quot;&amp;gt;like this&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; - a picture made out of a few pixels, depicting a gold coin with &amp;amp;quot;BC&amp;amp;quot; on it, looking really, really awful. I think it&amp;amp;#39;s pretty interesting that Satoshi himself designed the logo as a gold coin, as I&amp;amp;#39;ve seen many people complain over the years if the media illustrate stories about crypto with physical coins with crypto logos on them, because that&amp;amp;#39;s a wrong depiction. I always thought that was weird criticism - it&amp;amp;#39;s difficult to illustrate crypto stories, are they supposed to print a picture of code if they need a picture? - but it&amp;amp;#39;s interesting that Satoshi himself used a physical coin as a logo.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The second design was also by Satoshi and was presented on the Bitcointalk forum &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20130524055823/https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=64.0&quot;&amp;gt;on February 24, 2010&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; (archived version because the pictures don&amp;amp;#39;t work with the current one). It&amp;amp;#39;s closer to the current one, still a gold coin, but with the ₿ on it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The third and final design, the white ₿ on orange background, was presented about 8 months later, on &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20130525203057/https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1631.0;all&quot;&amp;gt;November 1, 2010&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; (again, archived version for the same reason as above) on Bitcointalk - by Bitboy. Okay, not &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;that&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; Bitboy, but a forum user with that name on Bitcointalk. Seemingly a pretty random user that only made a few posts on the forum. Crazy to think that the logo of a trillion-dollar-asset was not designed by a graphic designer but by a random guy on a forum. He said he was inspired by the Mastercard logo. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I think the current logo still looks quite good almost 12 years later, and I&amp;amp;#39;m glad we didn&amp;amp;#39;t stick with the Satoshi logos!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;i just wrote up an email in german and compiled a list of all german MEP Email adresses. If you cant be bothered to write something up yourself or to look for all the email addresses, please just copy and paste my email below and send it out to the adresses i provide at the bottom.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;Sehr geehrte/r Abgeordnete/r,die anstehende Abstimmung über den MiCA Regulierungsentwurf im ECON Committee beinhaltet seit kurzem Unterpunkte wie ALT A und ALT G, die ein weitreichendes Verbot für Kryptowährung basierend auf dem Konsensus ModellProof of Work zur Folge hätten. Dies würde die bei weitem bedeutensten und wichtigsten Kryptowährungen Bitcoin und Ethereum einschließen, die zusammen für den absolut überwiegenden Großteil der Innovationin diesem neuen Technologiesektor verantwortlich sind.&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;Dieses Verbot würde einschneidende Folgen haben:&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;Die Innovative und wachsende Branche für digitale Güter in Europa wird erheblichen Schaden nehmen und sich in Länder verschieben, in denen das notwendige Klima für technologische Innovation geschaffen wird.Die EU hat bereits verpasst auf die letzte technologische Revolution des Internets rechtzeitig aufzuspringen, als Resultat sind die USA absolut dominierend mit Unternehmen wie Google und Facebook. Bitte ersticken Sie jetzt nicht die Web 3.0 Branche im Keim indem Sie ein vorschnelles Verbot aussprechen.&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;Kryptowährungen wie Bitcoin und Ethereum können zwar verboten werden, dieses Verbot kann aber letztlich nie vollständig durchgesetzt werden da der Austausch dezentraler digitaler Güter nicht verhindert werden kann. Alles was dieses Verbot von Proof of Work erreicht, ist dass sich dieser Austausch außerhalb eines regulatorischen Rahmens entwickeln wird, was erheblichen negativen Einfluss auf den Komsumentenschutz hat.&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;Präsident Biden hat erst vor ein Paar Tagen mit seiner exectuive order zu Kryptowährungen gezeigt, dass die USA plant die führende Rolle in dieser neuen Technologiesparte zu übernehmen. Bitte lassen Sie die EU nicht Kapitulieren, bevor der Wettstreit überhaupt beginnt, indem Sie Proof of Work verbieten.&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;Zitat:“We must reinforce United States leadership in the global financial system and in technological and economic competitiveness, including through the responsible development of payment innovations and digital assets.  The United States has an interest in ensuring that it remains at the forefront of responsible development and design of digital assets and the technology that underpins new forms of payments and capital flows in the international financial system[.] Continued United States leadership in the global financial system will sustain United States financial power and promote United States economic interests.“&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;Deshalb bitte ich Sie eingehend, GEGEN das Proof of Work Verbot in MiCA zu stimmen, maßgeblich gegen die Punkte ALT A und ALT G.Ich vertraue darauf, dass Sie das richtige tun und diesen historischen Fehler verhindern.&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Stock market and Crypto saw massive sharp unexpected dips. All that happened for Crypto during a bear market period after the 2018 parabolic top. That was the time where BTC and Crypto were called &amp;amp;quot;officially death&amp;amp;quot; even by its own investors as this was very unexpected and many did not have any hope for a return.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here we are two years in the future. BTC recovered from a -80% down from its ATH and even after then made another +200%. All that from - 80% to +200% happened in about one year. And today just a year later those FOMO levels are the new Fear levels.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That up and downs are completely normal for Crypto. The ones who don&amp;amp;#39;t give up and stick to their strategy are those that will be rewarded. Even in the darkest of times we should know that everything is just transitory.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

It is also Non-fungable, meaning that it is not interchangeable with other NFTs, unlike Bitcoin or Monero, as 1 BTC will always be equal to 1 BTC, same with Monero.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And to people who will say that NFTs are nothing more than a bubble(or the entire crypto ecosystem for that matter), yes the current art market for NFTs are most likely a bubble and more than 90 percent of those &amp;amp;quot;projects&amp;amp;quot; will either crash or turn out to be scams. These things are not what I am interested in. I am interested in its practical applications.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now, onto the potential use cases for it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It can be used for:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;1 - Event ticketing, making counterfeiting tickets impossible, as when exactly each NFT was sold would be traceable in the blockchain, ensuring that only those that purchased it before a specific date could attend an event.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;2 - Real estate and cars. This would help in avoiding all the red tape of taxation, as when you purchase an NFT, it would automatically pay it&amp;amp;#39;s taxes to the authorities, ensuring that buying real estate would be as easy as buying the JPEG of a monkey.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;3 - Going into debt to fund a business in a decentralized way that also avoids major institutions like banks, as some actions that banks would take a fee off can be handled by the smart contract. For example, you create a collection of 10.000 NFTs, each selling from a price of 100. You ensure by the smart contract that it will buy back these NFTs exactly 1 year later for 107 dollars, if it has the capital. All this means that you took a loan with 7 percent interest rate not from a bank, but from the average individual who might have risked only 100 dollars.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;4 - Preventing naked short selling. Naked short selling occurs when a group of investors short stock that doesn&amp;amp;#39;t exist. This is suspected to have happened during the GME saga. Each and every single stock being traceable in the blockchain would ensure that no activities such as this can take place.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There are many other practical uses for NFTs that I can&amp;amp;#39;t think of right now, but I will post on reddit once I find out about them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I will have a look in the morning, as I will be going to sleep now.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I tried posting the exact same text on &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/unpopularopinion&quot;&amp;gt;r/unpopularopinion&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; before posting here, it got deleted from &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/unpopularopinion&quot;&amp;gt;r/unpopularopinion&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; because it had NFT in it. This just proves the point I am making in my post LOL.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you live in Europe, you can make a difference - contact your Member of European Parliament (MEP) and let them know that you oppose a Bitcoin ban in Europe&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;E-mail, call or tweet your MEP and tell them: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“An outright ban of proof-of-work assets will cripple the EU market, encourage circumvention of law, worsen consumer protection, and push the industry outside the EU – all with no benefit to the environment! Please ask the ECON Committee to oppose Amendments ALT A and ALT G.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you have enough time, a call and personal rephrasing of the above is preferred.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Wasn&amp;amp;#39;t this a big &amp;amp;quot;f*ck you&amp;amp;quot; in the face to everyone who are against crypto?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Imagine one country being at war. The situation is pretty bad, I don&amp;amp;#39;t have to explain why.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now imagine that country seeking for help in crypto? That country is, we all know, Ukraine.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And we can ask everyone - Why is cryptocurrency, extremely volatile asset, detached from the financial system, highly speculative asset used as a safe haven for people in need? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Because it allows anyone and everyone to be able to convert their personal wealth into highly portable, most of the time decentralized,  forms of money. And people who are leaving their homes, who want access to their funds, who want to be able to keep them safe will use crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Isn&amp;amp;#39;t this a strong use case? This is what we talked about for years. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;People from Ukraine are using crypto to survive, escape, buy something.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Ukrainian central bank limited ATM withdrawals, placed restrictions on the country’s official electronic-currency system and suspended the foreign-exchange market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Russian citizens, considering their national currency downtrend are also seeking help in cryptocurrencies.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are really on the global stage right now.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What crypto community did for Ukraine?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The idea was to build a tool that would allow people to automate their trading strategy using powerful customisation in an easy to understand package. Some of you have given some amazing feedback a while ago and we&amp;amp;#39;re doing our best to implement it into the platform.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Right now the logic, database and all the other backend bits are pretty much done (still largely untested though).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We&amp;amp;#39;re now working on finishing the front end and it looks like we might be ready for closed beta by the end of April!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The interface might still change up until then but here are some sneak previews:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/k3lt9ffwz4n81.png?width=1181&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=7d8542ad371bd21c9dbaa990d3506bc25d1ddfe6&quot;&amp;gt;Trades dashboard&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/8z0dcz5wz4n81.png?width=702&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=1c095a6f30ee1b8073e16e75e930d7c69a7fdfe9&quot;&amp;gt;Detailed bot configs&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The tool would allow you to create custom signals by combining a multitude of sources (indicators, volatility and even social media analysis in the future).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We&amp;amp;#39;re also planning to add copytrading in the future where you can just simply copy a profitable bot and run it yourself.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Join us at &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/aesirofficial&quot;&amp;gt;/r/aesirofficial&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; for more updates and to join the closed beta&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;1/ rooting for crypto as an investment that can buy you financial independence through fast paced growth. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;2/ rooting for crypto as a form of payment used in everyday life. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I understand that the intended purpose of crypto is closer to 2/, but unless it finds ways to firmly stabilize its value, I don’t think it can ever really succeed. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;1/ implies taxable events, holding, and risk. Using my crypto to pay for something leads me to tax exposure, potentially liquidating assets at the wrong time, and reducing potential future gains in the good times. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There is a reason we don’t pay for everyday things in stocks. We may reward them in shares (eg RSUs), but nobody treats stocks as a method of payment because it belongs in the investment assets class.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;From this POV, how can anyone say they want what behaves like an investment asset with limited supply to serve as a currency?  Shouldn’t the valuation (and supply) of each token aim to be a lot more stable than what most projects offer?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: some people are pointing out the existence of stable coins - I know, and that’s kind of the point. I’m puzzled by the constant celebration of non stablecoins being accepted as payment. I think paying for your latte with ETH is what makes zero sense (unless you’re an absolutist).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

After an exciting year in 2021, the cryptocurrency space is becoming a ghost town, like the elders from 2017 prophesied. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I am not just talking about prices, which has been depressed for a few weeks now ; the hype surrounding our ecosystem is fading. Google Trends clearly shows that searches for terms like &amp;amp;quot;bitcoin&amp;amp;quot;, &amp;amp;quot;NFT&amp;amp;quot; and &amp;amp;quot;crypto&amp;amp;quot; are at their lowest level since summer, and the activity on this sub has been falling off a cliff. The Daily barely have 2k comments...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But here&amp;amp;#39;s the deal : &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;I am convinced that, in a few years, people will look at that slump as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; If you are still holding, or even better, DCAing, you&amp;amp;#39;re gonna make it. Well, probably.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Every single person that was there in 2017 told me the same thing : those who bought and hold during the brutal bear market made insane amount of money when the bull came back. And, from a long-term perspective, there is a lot of reasons to be bullish. Ethereum will finally switch to proof-of-stake in about three months, Bitcoin has been hold surprisingly well against growth/tech stocks, a lot of new protocols are being worked on/launched, Biden basically told us last week the US will regulate - but not ban - cryptocurrencies...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Could the prices get lower in the next few weeks? Absolutely. Inflation, war, recession : it&amp;amp;#39;s possible that we drill further down. But if you hold through this tumultuous period, you will emerge on the other side wealthier.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is in moments like these that characters are forged. I hope that in ten years you can look back on this time and be proud that you stayed true to your convictions!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Well, if that is true, you still want to lump sum,  so that you have as much time as possible in the market. On average, for Bitcoin, you want to buy as early as possible. And with DCA you don&amp;amp;#39;t buy as early as possible.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then you have to consider, if DCA were such an amazing strategy, then everyone on Reddit should be really rich by now. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;But DCA&amp;amp;#39;ing during the bull market only makes your average cost higher.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But don&amp;amp;#39;t take it up with me, take it up with the data:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/q468okd5oym81.png?width=1229&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=0f5938fae7696a27eb0220776090031d6d84299b&quot;&amp;gt;DCA underperforms lump sum 81&amp;amp;#37; of the time.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I expect that everyone will disagree with this post, because all Reddit can say is &amp;amp;quot;DCA and hold&amp;amp;quot;, but that&amp;amp;#39;s whatever. If it works for you, it&amp;amp;#39;s fine.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Just know that you underperform everyone who just invests as much as possible as early as possible.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
