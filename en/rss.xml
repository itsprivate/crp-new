&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I remember first time I got into crypto, I was checking the charts every 5 minutes and get real depressed if my coin drops more than 5%. I don&amp;amp;#39;t feel that anymore. I just don&amp;amp;#39;t.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also I don&amp;amp;#39;t think about crypto all the time like I used to. I don&amp;amp;#39;t even think about my coins 90% of the time lol.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Regarding that other popular post, this doesn’t mean Ticketmaster can’t charge us ridiculous extra fees for facilitating concert ticket sales because they work with the people who own and operate the venue. Not the artists. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This has nothing to do with centralization and it has nothing to do with the form of currency they’re ripping us off in. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto won’t solve asset seizure or sanctions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It’s not designed to help you evade your taxes. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It’s not going to “dethrone” fiat currency because it’s not a competition. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Crypto is a tool like the internet is a tool. It’s one component in a large machine and can be used to serve and to fuck us, usually at the same time. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We aren’t going to replace governments with a crypto backed DAO because the problem corrupt governments isn’t that we don’t have a shared ledger. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anytime there’s a problem and you think crypto can solve it, consider what the problem actually is and what having access to shared record would solve with respect to that problem. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Media blackout in your war torn country? Crypto doesn’t solve this. PayPal, gofundme, etc stopped processing your cash? Unless you can exclusively pay all your bills and be paid in crypto, it won’t help you there either. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At the end of the day, remember what blockchain is. It’s a decentralized ledger. It’s a SQL database that everyone can see and no one can modify. Only it’s slower and consumes far more resources than a single SQL server. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Unless the issue is ultimately rooted in ineffective record keeping, crypto doesn’t really solve it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;I will just say outright I am not a fan, and let me tell you why...very few transactions are actually handled by bitcoin, and many of those do take place on bitcoin are illegal, illicit transactions&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The whole criminals and terrorists use crypto narrative.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;To the extent it is used, I fear it&amp;amp;#39;s often for illicit finance&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://news.bitcoin.com/janet-yellen-admits-crypto-has-benefits-treasury-working-on-crypto-regulation/&quot;&amp;gt;And now&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; that all the big banks have started buying up crypto all of a sudden according to dear Janet &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Crypto has obviously grown by leaps and bounds and it’s now playing a significant role&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;There are benefits from crypto and we recognize that the innovation in the payment system can be a healthy thing&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What a surprise that the government employee&amp;amp;#39;s tone on crypto changes once the people with the money are starting to use it to make more money!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I was recently reminded again why Ticketmaster is one of the most hated company in the world. I wish them a quick bankruptcy. I bought tickets for a concert and the tickets fees were more than 75% of the original ticket price. Which is absurd. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The internet is full of people complaining about Ticketmaster and their fees. For instance this hilariours woman:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Why are Badbunny tickets so expensive? Y’all making me want to sell pictures of my husbands feet on only fans – frustrated Ticketmaster customer&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@_j_e_n_n_/video/6950782961763601670?is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.tiktok.com/@_j_e_n_n_/video/6950782961763601670?is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the “Last Week Tonight” show, John Oliver explained the shady behavior of Ticketmaster in an entertaining way, including clips of frustrated Ticketmaster customers (like the one above). &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;A short recap:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- Average prices of tickets have more than tripled, since the 1990s (even before tickets hit the resale market)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- Ticket fees are determined in collaboration with Ticketmaster’s clients (Venues, Promoters, sometimes the artists)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- These other parties that share in the tickets fees are mostly owned by… Ticketmaster&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- Ticketmaster facilitates professional scalpers and multiple account use&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- In some cases less than 8% of all tickets for shows of major artists gets sold directly to the public. Where do the rest of the tickets go? To professional ticket scalpers&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- Professional scalpers represent the overwhelming majority of sellers on secondary market places&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- Scalpers mark-up the price  on average with 49%, but sometimes even hike up the price more than 10x&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- Secondary markets charge exorbitant fees&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The result of this is that the ticketing industry is very inefficient. Parties that do not create any value for fans and artists receive a big cut of the revenue &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_Y7uqqEFnY&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_Y7uqqEFnY&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;How can blockchain technology improve the ticketing industry?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- Blockchains are transparent and immutable. Scammy practices such as direct selling on secondary markets or selling huge amounts of tickets to professional scalpers will be visible to fans&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- Smart contracts can be programmed with a maximum resale price or maximum mark-up from the original price &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- Blockchain cut out the middle men allowing artist to sell more directly to fans&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- Tickets can include a royalty fee for artists, when tickets are sold resold (similar to royalty fees on NFT art). &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- NFT tickets become tradeable digital collectibles, allowing artists to interact with their fans even after the event&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;R.I.P. Ticketsmaster. I hope we will soon be able to buy tickets for our favourite artists without ridiculous ticket fees.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In this post so many people said they&amp;amp;#39;d steal all of the funds from a wallet they accidentally got access to. I think this is monumentally fucked up and shows how desperate and immoral a lot of people are. If you decide you&amp;amp;#39;d steal someone else&amp;amp;#39;s money given a chance and consider this a lottery ticket, then you are no different at all from the hackers and scammers that have ruined peoples lives. Apart from the intelligence of being able to directly carry off a plan to complete such a goal. To complain about anything revolving around a hack or a rug pull in the future would be the epitome of hypocrisy. So don&amp;amp;#39;t complain. Instead, endorse and show your true colors.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

To put it short, it&amp;amp;#39;s a decentralized Reddit alternative that will use public key based addressing and p2p subnetwork to operate. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s pretty crazy alright. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Esteban believes that this design would solve the problems of a serverless, adminless decentralized Reddit alternative. It would allow unlimited amounts of the so-called subplebbits (subreddits), users, posts, comments and votes. This is achieved by not caring about the order or availability of old data. It would allow users to post for free using an Reddit like interface. It would allow subplebbit owners to moderate spam semi-automatically using their own captcha service over peer-to-peer pubsub. It would allow for all features that make Reddit addictive: upvotes, replies, notifications, awards, and a chance to make the &amp;amp;quot;front page&amp;amp;quot;. All this without any fears of illegal content as it wont allow any media hosting. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So technically, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://plebbit.eth.limo/&quot;&amp;gt;Plebbit&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; client developers to serve an unlimited amount of users, without any server, legal, advertising or moderation infrastructure. PLEB is their native token which will be used for the Plebbit similar to the what reddit does with it&amp;amp;#39;s community points if you will. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;His &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/plebbit/whitepaper/discussions/2&quot;&amp;gt;github&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; has been constantly updated for a while with a lot of work and he seems really dedicated. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I took some info from their &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@plebbit&quot;&amp;gt;Medium&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; article.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

According to kraken, when a deposit is sent on the Binance Smart Chain to a standard Ethereum address, the private keys would need to be exported and then imported into a Binance Smart Chain wallet in order to recover the funds. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However, this is not possible with their ERC-20 deposit addresses, as they are generated using smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Addresses generated this way don’t have private keys associated to them, therefore they have nothing to export.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Therefore, my money gone. Therefore, I am a fool. Dammit.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If this is the only thing developers of the project are forcing, targeting, then chances are high that you invested in a shitcoin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Not only that, but sometimes you will see a massive 50% burn immediately after the launch.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They will talk about great burning of 50% like it is the best thing in the world and the only &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;thing that matters in crypto.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With that they will also try to &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;hide their whales messing around with % of the coin ownership&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; (&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;for example on BSC scan, if you have 10m tokens and supply is 100m tokens, they burn 50%, BSC scan will show you as the owner of  10% while truth is you own much more then that. It is because BSC count the burn address in the pool aswell)&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I don&amp;amp;#39;t even know why do we keep calling it &amp;amp;quot;shitcoin&amp;amp;quot; when most of them are &amp;amp;quot;shitTOKENS&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now I am not saying that you are not able to make money with it, its your call and your decisions, not all of them are a rugpull. Also some legit projects are burning coins, but that is not the main thing of their project.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you plan to hold it long term, beware&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The big source of money during a bear market. But in reality staking does not help much, it won&amp;amp;#39;t make you rich through passive income unless you already put in very high sums to stake, then you may gain some reasonable amounts.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Many have that misconception here that staking is that cool &amp;amp;quot;passive income&amp;amp;quot; that makes you money while you sleep. But you really won&amp;amp;#39;t make much money at all. It&amp;amp;#39;s actually an amount you can just ignore. Personally I staked and committed ALGO to governance (the possibly simplest staking coin), still I did not got any amount that may be worth the time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Obviously it&amp;amp;#39;s always nice to get some bonus and as it&amp;amp;#39;s free money you should definitely take it. But don&amp;amp;#39;t think that you will become rich due to it. Staking is just a way to expand your fortune, not change it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Since March 11, Ether has climbed by roughly 24%, while Bitcoin has increased by about 16%.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The enthusiasm around a planned software upgrade that promises to minimize the blockchain&amp;amp;#39;s carbon footprint while also improving the network&amp;amp;#39;s scalability and efficiency is driving the Ether gains. The next significant, ambitious milestone for the Ethereum network is expected to attract millions of additional users.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As far as I can tell, the merge, which is Ethereum&amp;amp;#39;s transition from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake blockchain, has been greatly anticipated and may be the network&amp;amp;#39;s most significant development since its founding in 2015.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I believe the price of ETH will skyrocket since all transactions formerly carried out with USDT BEAN and other stablecoins, as well as other cryptocurrencies, can and will be carried out on the ETH network. Definitely the next big thing in the crypto realm, and I&amp;amp;#39;m looking forward to seeing it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

While it does seem like its more oriented towards stablecoin regulation, there are some interesting takeaways for defi too.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;First, they aim to bring stablecoins under regulation, so it can be used as a form of payment! This is massive for the entire crypto space! Imagine if you can spend USDC and possibly GBP stables straight from your wallet on e-commerce websites, travels, and even instore shopping? It could be a game changer for crypto adoption. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Stablecoins to be brought within regulation paving their way for use in the UK as a recognised form of payment.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On DeFi: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The UK government will explore ways of enhancing the competitiveness of the UK tax system to encourage further development of the cryptoasset market in the UK. It will review how DeFi loans – where holders of cryptoassets lend them out for a return – are treated for tax purposes&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Treating defi loans has been tricky, with some countries like Sweden even considering defi loans as a capital gains tax event. (For example, if you borrow stables from crypto, it is treated as if you sold the crypto. This is by far the worst treatment). Friendly regulations here could grow the crypto market in the country, as users can take loans from defi protocols without it being considered as a tax event. This in turn could spur the economy, as the money borrowed from defi can be used in regular economic activity. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak said: It’s my ambition to make the UK a global hub for cryptoasset technology, and the measures we’ve outlined today will help to ensure firms can invest, innovate and scale up in this country.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Overall, the move seem positive and the full proposal is much awaited! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Something that moves 20% [overnight] does not feel like a currency. It is a vehicle to perpetrate fraud&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To this&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/31/bitcoin-goldman-is-close-to-offering-bitcoin-to-its-richest-clients.html&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/31/bitcoin-goldman-is-close-to-offering-bitcoin-to-its-richest-clients.html&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;We are working closely with teams across the firm to explore ways to offer thoughtful and appropriate access to the ecosystem for private wealth clients&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;There are also a large contingent of clients who feel like we’re sitting at the dawn of a new Internet in some ways and are looking for ways to participate in this space&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;We’re still in the very nascent stages of this ecosystem; But I think it’s fairly safe to expect it will be part of our future.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So from a vehicle for fraudsters to the dawn of a new internet that their wealthiest clients cant wait to invest in. And these are the people we are supposed to trust to invest our money huh?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Every successful market needs a ton of products. We can&amp;amp;#39;t always rely on one. But obviously BTC is and will always remain the godfather of Crypto but good development would show even better products coming.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It can happen to anyone. You&amp;amp;#39;re tired, arguing with your gf, distracted, etc... nobody is perfect. He lost everything. I can&amp;amp;#39;t afford that. Shit gives me nightmares.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;ve been intending to buy a Trezor for some time now, but I keep hesitating. I&amp;amp;#39;ve been so nervous about the whole thing. What if I lose my seed phrase? I live n NYC, someone breaks into my apartment, a fire, collapse, etc.. call me paranoid.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now that Coinbase One offers insurance, I&amp;amp;#39;m not even going to worry about cold storage. I sleep better this way. I don&amp;amp;#39;t care about all the &amp;amp;quot;not your keys not your coins&amp;amp;quot; arguments. I have a legally enforceable contract with Coinbase now that I pay for.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;True, it&amp;amp;#39;s price is kinda steep at $30 a month, but to me it&amp;amp;#39;s worth it. It comes with no trading fees which sweetens the pie. Also comes with &amp;amp;quot;priority&amp;amp;quot; customer support, which I tested and only had to wait 2 minutes before I was speaking to a live agent.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So yeah, fuck that. I&amp;amp;#39;m just too paranoid. If US gov ever looks like it&amp;amp;#39;s on the verge of collapse, then yeah, I might put it in cold storage before I bounce out of the country. Until them I rest easy with my coins insured on an exchange.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Let the hate begin...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Stablecoins are a huge part of the defi infrastructure, and whoever controls stablecoin market stands to gain the most adoption in the space. This is why commercial banks and even central banks are interested in the crypto space so much - there is a ton of money to be made. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;UST has been making headlines in recent months, both positive and negative. It&amp;amp;#39;s market cap has grown to several billions in a short time, and recently has been buying up billions worth BTC to backstop their stablecoin. However it has not gone without criticism and concern, many have pointed out how it is less of an algorithmic stablecoin now and more of an asset backed stablecoin. In reply, Terranauts have maintained that the ends justify the means - the stated goal of Terra is to be the most widely adopted stablecoin. Whether it is purely algorithimic or asset backed is dependent on how the market evolves. If the market feels it is risky for $20 bn worth stablecoins to be just backed by algorithm, then Terra team will ensure the demands of the market are met. With UST, many users were uncomfortable that it is unbacked by assets, and hence they came up with a proposal to buy bitcoins. A comparison can be made with a space flight programme - the goal is to reach space. Whether it uses an internal combustion engine or pivots a few years later to electric ion thrusters doesnt change the goal. Similarly, the only goal of Terra is to be the largest stablecoin in terms of adoption. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Earlier this year, the founder of Maker DAO (DAI stablecoin) called UST a &amp;amp;quot;solid ponzi&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/6neert82s8r81.jpg?width=2274&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=b4017b735a9c143ebcee4363da91276a05b8197c&quot;&amp;gt;Rune: \&amp;amp;quot;UST and MIM are solid ponzis\&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In return, UST teamed up with another stablecoin Frax to announce a Curve 4-pool as a competitor to replace 3-pool.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/t8pvbscds8r81.jpg?width=1346&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=ce4a70d6eab1e854350420ea3c4efe06a105c524&quot;&amp;gt;Curve 4-pool launched with UST and Frax&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;What is a curve pool?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Curve is the DEX with the highest TVL for stablecoins, and curve pools provide deep liquidity for stablecoin swaps. For example if you are swapping 1m USDC to DAI, you will find a better rate on Curve compared to other swaps like Uniswap. Curve wars have been going on for a while now, with several protocols looking to capture Curve emissions. Together with Convex (CVX), DAOs are able to gain userbase by directing incentives to pool participants. If Curve is the king of Defi, Convex can be regarded as the King maker. CRV+CVX combo can direct large portions of defi markets and are primitive protocols behind the defi infrastructure. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Curve 3-pool has been the standard stablecoin liquidity pool across defi till now. Many protocols utilise the 3-pool for their liquidity requirements. Now, UST and Frax are looking to disrupt this. Terra with Frax along with additional partners like Redacted Cartel control a huge portion of the CVX supply. With this, they are able to direct emissions towards the 4-pool, thus they will able to sustain a higer APY for 4-pool over 3-pool and move liquidity from 3-pool towards the new 4-pool. For instance, if the 3-pool has 1.5% APY and 4-pool is able to sustain 5% APY due to their control over CVX, a lot of liquidity from 3pool will migrate to 4pool. Currently, 3pool has around $3.5 BN worth liquidity that is going to be incentivized to move to 4-pool.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;What does it mean for DAI?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To put it shortly, a war has been declared on DAI. 4-pool excludes DAI, so if a lot of liquidity from 3-pool moves towards 4-pool, the liquidity of DAI will drop drastically. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/6m7rw60nv8r81.jpg?width=1308&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=d582977937d7916486992c84260425971adec58a&quot;&amp;gt;DAI liquidity could drop dramatically. &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Currently, there is no incentive to provide any liquidity to the 3-pool. With incentives on 4pool, we could see a lot of the TVL migrate. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/r8z7egpgu8r81.jpg?width=1316&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=ff4f22b66b540c2b9e8a420e7b3ac49c3572dcb6&quot;&amp;gt;Do Kwon: The goal is to starve 3pool. &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While Maker DAI has been publicly attacking UST and Terra, Terra have been working behind the scenes to make their move and have partnered with influential protocols like Frax and Redacted Cartel. And it is a bold one. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Dethroning 3-pool isnt as easy as most of defi liquidity is based on 3pool currently. However USD+Frax DAOs control a big chunk of CRV and CVX so they will definitely give it their best shot. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/z14aj4hju8r81.jpg?width=1320&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=4e173236f93c40cca408453f8c538560e1ff34bf&quot;&amp;gt;DAI liquidity on most DEX is just a few millions. &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Everyone is now interested to see what will DAI&amp;amp;#39;s next move will be!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
