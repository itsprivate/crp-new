&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Instead, you keep reaching for one of the thousands of sweets that seem so delicious. They have such interesting names and the packaging says all sorts of great things. When you&amp;amp;#39;re out shopping, you just can&amp;amp;#39;t avoid putting them in your cart.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The sweets can satisfy your cravings much better than the boring broccoli. You know that could hurt you. Obesity or diabetes but you need that quick dopamine rush.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So guys, stay healthy and brush your teeth properly. Tooth decay is no joke.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;We expect first quarter 2022 total revenue to be in the range of $27-29 billion, which represents 3-11% year-over-year growth. We expect our year-over-year growth in the first quarter to be impacted by headwinds to both impression and price growth.&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;On the impressions side, we expect continued headwinds from both increased competition for people&amp;amp;#39;s time and a shift of engagement within our apps towards video surfaces like Reels, which monetize at lower rates than Feed and Stories.&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;On the pricing side, we expect growth to be negatively impacted by a few factors:&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;First, we will lap a period in which Apple&amp;amp;#39;s iOS changes were not in effect and we anticipate modestly increasing ad targeting and measurement headwinds from platform and regulatory changes.&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;Second, we will lap a period of strong demand in the prior year and we&amp;amp;#39;re hearing from advertisers that macroeconomic challenges like cost inflation and supply chain disruptions are impacting advertiser budgets.&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;Finally, based on current exchange rates, we expect foreign currency to be a headwind to year-over-year growth.&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So, Apple&amp;amp;#39;s &amp;amp;quot;Ask App not to track&amp;amp;quot; feature has negatively affected Facebook&amp;amp;#39;s ad revenue and ad campaigns as they can&amp;amp;#39;t track these users anymore, steal their data and making money off of targeted ads more efficiently.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And as Zoomers are more into tik tok, reels based ads have lower monetization rate.So, what does Zucc do? Zucc is thinking about creating their own metaverse, kinda like Sandbox or Decentraland, but with actual VR and monetize it by playing ads(Like how people are buying lands in Sandbox and Mana to advertise their business) and stealing more data from users.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is because, they realized, since they will not have a majority chunk of iphone users data which is always a big part of their revenue because majority of the United States use iphone and ad rates are better for Western countries rather than third world countries, Zucc realized he can&amp;amp;#39;t control mobile devices anymore, hence he wants his own Matrix style Dystopian Metaverse with targeted ads.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Facebook has literally shaped how modern society is. The harm what facebook has done and is continuing to due on many fronts to the population is irreversible. Facebook should not be allowed to succeed in it&amp;amp;#39;s Metaverse plans.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sincerely, FUCK FACEBOOK!  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I saw it posted today), a company called &amp;amp;quot;CoinShares&amp;amp;quot; published &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://coinshares.com/research/bitcoin-mining-network-2022&quot;&amp;gt;a report&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; that tries really hard to push the narrative that BTC is totally not bad for the environment and that all of that is FUD.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Who is CoinShares? A company whose &amp;amp;quot;mission is to expand access to the digital asset ecosystem&amp;amp;quot; - in other words, a company that is dependent on crypto succeeding. If you read the report and you don&amp;amp;#39;t have rose-colored glasses, that becomes obvious for you - even though they pick the numbers most favorable for them, they find that BTC accounts for only 0.08% of CO2 emitted worldwide.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Think about that, that&amp;amp;#39;s almost a thousandth of all CO2 - for something that really isn&amp;amp;#39;t used all that much. That number is huge, and probably even higher in reality.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s a laughable effort of declaring BTCs environmental problems FUD. In a few decades, when we hopefully have mostly solved crypto&amp;amp;#39;s environmental problems, we will look back at studies like that the same way we regard &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.history.com/news/cigarette-ads-doctors-smoking-endorsement&quot;&amp;gt;cigarette ads from the 1930s and 1940s&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; with doctors saying they are not at all bad for your health.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now I don&amp;amp;#39;t know what to do with all this ETH. It&amp;amp;#39;s worth approximately 250 millions USD, which is not bad, if you ask me. Should I stake it all and get the 4% rewards? This way I would get passive income, something like 10 millions USD/year, which is theoritically enough for my family to live a comfortable life. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also, by staking, I would be contributing to the security of the blockchain, which is a big plus for me - I wanna do my part!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But is this the best course of action for me?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I also thought about getting into liquidity pools, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;but I am afraid of smart contract risks&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. What if I put all my ETH into a LP on Solana, and then some asshole comes and drain the contract? I worked very hard for this ETH, that would suck. And there&amp;amp;#39;s also the risk of impermanent loss - what if my ETH on Solana decoupled from the ETH on mainnet?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyway, thanks everyone, and I look forward to read your ideas.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Either it’s down cause its out of RAM, got attacked by a DDOS and now it got hacked.
There’s always something wrong with this chain.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Honestly I feel like it’s one of the most overhyped projects on the market especially with other chains like Polygon being MUCH more consistent, cheaper and faster.
At least when Polygon gets DDOSed it doesn’t come to a complete stop like Solana. In fact even with the attack, Polygon still had one of the cheapest fees ok the market.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I honestly don’t know why anyone would keep supporting and hyping this chain anymore…&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

(Around $3200 for approximately 8800 Tezos tokens)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Today, the IRS has decided to issue that refund. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They will not refund any amount that was sold obviously but the couple is getting refunded for the entire amount requested, the tax they paid on the rewards that they did not sale. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This could be huge for everyone involved in cryptocurrency. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Nothing else is taxed at the moment of creation&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The records will be made public Thursday and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;the IRS has not made any public statements&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Source: Blockworks .com&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Jarrett couple argued that new coins are tax-payer created property and should not be taxed until sold or exchanged. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Edit: For those that are unfamiliar, capital assets like cryptocurrency are taxed in more than one way.&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;When you sell, trade, or dispose of a capital asset you incur &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;capital gains tax&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;When you receive crypto through staking rewards, mining, airdrops, the IRS views that as income and it’s subject to &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;income tax&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, just like interest you earn on fiat in a traditional bank.&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;You owe income tax on it whether you sell or not.&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;This is what is in question, taxing something that has not been sold or traded, only created.&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

However, the people who did not leave are the ones who went through at least 2 Bitcoin bull cycles and the whales. A 45% steady price decrease is nothing but an accumulation strategy, and we can see this across the board with veteran wallets.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Largest Individual Bitcoin Wallet (Accumulating)&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/2n5hczi7fhf81.png?width=1512&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=0f811ada619e43b9c547d3e4f4c77dbf74f548d4&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/2n5hczi7fhf81.png?width=1512&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=0f811ada619e43b9c547d3e4f4c77dbf74f548d4&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The largest individual wallet has also been accumulating Bitcoin in anticipation of a continued bull cycle. This wallet seemed to have been largely correct on calculating when to start accumulating. Moreover, MicroStrategy and El Salvador are just two other examples out of hundreds of other corporations and whales that have started to accumulate cheap Bitcoin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Bitcoin Supply on Exchanges at Multi-Year Low&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/6cg71z74ihf81.png?width=1434&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=2f079f70bc3009f4271694b9551eca03c25a0534&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/6cg71z74ihf81.png?width=1434&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=2f079f70bc3009f4271694b9551eca03c25a0534&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Despite the selling pressure from people that are panicking, the exchanges are actually losing Bitcoin supply as most of it is being bought for cheap by whales. The Current supply has dropped to 13.27%, and at this rate we could see huge supply shortages by 2028-2030, or even faster as the next Bitcoin halving will have a significant effect on supply.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TLDR: The only people who are currently selling are panicked investors or newbies who&amp;amp;#39;d rather take a 45% loss now than reduce that loss by DCAing. Whales are not selling, and instead they&amp;amp;#39;re buying up huge amounts of Bitcoin which has historically been a very bullish signal for the price.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But thus subs own crypto MOONS are also, definitely, a shitcoin. It&amp;amp;#39;s far away from any utility, let liquidy be it is not even listed on ANY good-enough exchanges, let alone the major ones. There is no easy or understandable way from selling those apart from a 45 step swap.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And there is no real roadmap for the near future with specific dates. The only thing we know is that a mainnet is coming. Someday.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I definitely do not say MOONS will forever be shit, but they for now are and there is no point against that and in also sure people are currently working to change that and I appreciate those people.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Honestly last time i saw that kind of crash was with ICP crypto&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

This post is for those of you that do.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What is staking? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Staking is a mechanic where you lock up your cryptos and generate passive income as you are helping to secure the blockchain through said mechanic. So you don&amp;amp;#39;t have to do anything and you can generate passive income through staking. This is just like interest in banks but only with much better APY. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Let&amp;amp;#39;s say I have 32 ETH and I am staking them for a 6% APY. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So 32 ETH x 6% = 1.92 ETH&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That gives you 1.92 ETH for free by staking every year. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There are many coins that let you stake. BTC doesn&amp;amp;#39;t let you stake but you can lend it out to generate some passive income. Generally, the APY for staking is around 5% give or take. Some provide more some provide less. If you are HODLing anyway, why not let your crypto make you more crypto. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That&amp;amp;#39;s a win-win.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The thing is, when it comes to addictions, the vast majority of them trigger dopamine, when you do that particular activity. That&amp;amp;#39;s the main reason why you KEEP doing it. This will mess with your thinking, because you are chasing only that.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When you are trading crypto, you will definietly need to get your mind right before making any decisions. 
We all know that good feeling when we see the gains. It triggers dopamine, just like an addiction. Now, I want to say there is nothing wrong with feeling good about the gains. However, unfortunately if you have an addiction (doesn&amp;amp;#39;t matter what kind: drugs, porn, smoking very regularly) you are much more likely to just trade for the feeling of it. 
I experienced this myself.
It&amp;amp;#39;s also dangerous to trade when you are in the process of kicking the addiction!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you can&amp;amp;#39;t get rid of it alone, get help from others and don&amp;amp;#39;t be ashamed of it! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also, if you have porn addiction, feel free to DM me if you want. I&amp;amp;#39;m no professional but I&amp;amp;#39;m ready to help!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thanks for reading!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
