&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A new NFT collection was launched on Saturday by the Bored Ape Yacht Club team. The Ethereum blockchain was crushed by the demand.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Bored Ape Yacht Club crashed Ethereum on Saturday night. As part of the upcoming Bored Ape metaverse called Otherside, developers Yuga Labs on Saturday launched a new NFT collection which consists of 100,000 land deeds for the virtual world. Interest in the drop was immense -- too much for the Ethereum blockchain to handle. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Users ended up paying thousands of dollars in fees for failed transactions, and Ethereum proved unusable for hours due to its inability to distribute the load.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How are users ok spending thousands in fees for failed transactions and why are people so hell bent on saying Ethereum is the place to be when launching such products, as the gas prices can at times outweigh the amount you spend on a transaction?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I just don&amp;amp;#39;t understand why there cant be a refund mechanism for failed transactions, especially in circumstances when the blockchain is overloaded by users.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hey Guys,&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Tesla founder Elon Musk’s acquisition of Twitter ought not to have taken anyone by surprise — least of all those of us in the cryptocurrency community. But there may be some ill feeling in the air.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Musk’s dalliance with crypto has seen him in the Twitter spotlight since the crypto market began soaring to all-time highs early last year, and he has remained prolific in his commentary on Bitcoin and other tokens that are now, thanks in large measure to his influence, well known.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He has been sued multiple times by shareholders of his own companies and others — including Twitter — over potentially market-moving tweets, which have been described as “erratic,” among other things.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yet Musk’s purchase of Twitter has now given him a bigger megaphone than ever.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What Musk’s latest acquisition means for the crypto space, however, is moot, although it is abundantly clear that his conduct has alienated many in the community, and he has been accused of treating crypto investors like playthings as the values of their portfolios have undergone wild swings amid the caprice of his Twitter messaging.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This man is truly unstoppable and humanity should be looking forward to his exploration of Mars in 2029. If you ever wondered how Elon Musk would look like if he got attacked by aliens on Mars, there is a good representation of this portrayed by Mutant Musks NFT. I found it quite intriguing as an NFT veteran.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What will Elon do next?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bitcoin&amp;amp;#39;s halving cycles are the prime target because they are the main catalyst behind all crypto bull cycles. When bitcoin rallies, fresh capitals flow into crypto, and those seeking higher returns flow from bitcoin into altcoins with emerging narratives. When a bull cycle ends most of these profits then flow back into bitcoin and a fraction of these into fiat and stablecoins. As inflation materialises, it exposes more of the flaws and corrupt nature of central bank controlled fiat currencies. As result the incentive for capitals to jump back in crypto, or stay in crypto altogether by parking in stablecoins, is/will be stronger at the end of the current cycle than it was at the end of any of the earlier cycles where expansionary monetary policy was at an earlier stage. Vis-a-vis increasingly inflationary fiat currencies and never ending expansionary monetary policies, non inflationary cryptos such as bitcoin become a natural hedge against inflation as they allow savers to preserve more of their purchase power.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Less people using fiat currencies undermines the authority of central banks. CBs are the strings through which big private banks and corporations (puppeteers) pull the strings of politicians and policymakers (puppets). To maintain their power and relevance banks will not go down without a fight, and putting up a good fight is what they are doing, especially in the EU. Banks&amp;amp;#39; mission is to strangulate a competitor that generates more value for society, crypto, and for this they have come up with a doctrine on where and how to hit crypto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;The Ideologue&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The chief ideologue is &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alex-De-Vries&quot;&amp;gt;Alex De Vries&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, an analyst of the central bank of Netherlands and founder of the anti crypto blog &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://digiconomist.net/&quot;&amp;gt;Digiconomist&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. De Vries is also a researcher of the University Vrije of Amsterdam. By going through his research papers on Researchgate, I found out that he has been obsessed with the idea of ending bitcoin&amp;amp;#39;s halving cycles to undermine its profitability for holders and role as inflation hedge. He has re-affirmed it over and over in all possible mediums, not just academic but also in political and financial salons as well as (pseudo) procrypto conferences such as Consensys.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In one of his latest statements, commenting on crypto&amp;amp;#39;s climate footprint debate and the role bitcoin could have in climate change, De Vries has listed the 2 ways in which Europe could contain (capitals flows into) crypto without upsetting the US crypto players, investment funds and corporations that have added crypto to their balance sheets:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Taxation and transaction limits&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Implementing trading restrictions against some cryptos (bitcoin)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Pertaining the first weapon, we are already seeing laws &amp;amp;amp; regulation to kyc unhosted wallets and eventually roll out additional limits that were unthinkable before. This &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2022/04/24/target-the-bitcoin-price-internal-documents-reveal-how-the-eu-could-try-to-ban-bitcoin-and-protect-ethereum/?sh=6efeb9e27201&quot;&amp;gt;Forbes article&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; is also revealing as it discusses pushes from lobbyists to orient policymakers towards measures that discourage activities that could act as a price catalyst for bitcoin by encouraging traders to orient towards ethereum instead. The excuse is, of course, climate change. In reality however the reason is that Ether was always designed to have a limited upside price wise.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Why crypto bull cycles undermine the stability of the Euro (but not the USD)&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As explained in the above paragraphs, Europe is the epicenter of the efforts of anti-crypto strategies meant to discourage adoption and create entry barriers for capitals looking to enter crypto markets. The ultimate objective of the guidelines published by the DNB and CBE is to make crypto less profitable by breaking the halving cycles. If crypto stops being profitable for &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;hodlers,&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; they could still be used as a store of value, as it happens in the US, but without doing too much damage to the euro. It is this principle on which Fabio Panetta&amp;amp;#39;s most recent statement stands:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2022/html/ecb.sp220425%7E6436006db0.en.html&quot;&amp;gt;We should make faster progress if we want to ensure that crypto-assets do not trigger a lawless frenzy of risk-taking.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fabio Panetta is a member of the executive council of the European Central Bank. What Mr Panetta means with &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;lawless frenzy of risk taking&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; is nothing less than price rallies that would allow savers to obtain higher profits by investing in crypto than by investing their savings in traditional investment vehicles controlled by the institution in whose executive board Mr Panetta sits. Obviously, dinosaurs like Mr Panetta that have abused with impunity European savers and the European middle class for decades, are horrified by the prospects of crypto adoption. It is a simple matter of competition not only against crypto, but also against the US dollar. In fact with every bull cycle more capitals flow into crypto and with profit taking most of capitals that originated from euro are then parked into US dollars. The main reason for this is the absence of any euro stablecoins (there are some, but with negligible adoption).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This flight of capitals at every bull cycle is another reason why European banks (spearheaded by the ECB and DNB) are more wary of crypto than their US counterparts. The US Treasury is well aware of this mechanism and the positive effect it has on the US dollar.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;The difference between the US and EU crypto approach&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The influence on crypto markets from the EU and US are different because while in the US we see increasing institutional involvement, in the EU it is the retail market to have expanded most in the past couple of years. US institutional adoption has contributed to minimise crypto volatility mainly through the emergence of institutional investors, that act as long term hodlers. Another mechanism is the fact that having the US become the global crypto mining hub, US miners have more access to capital markets and don&amp;amp;#39;t need to sell their coins on the spot. This displacement of spot markets from Asia into the US has/will stabilise prices further limiting also the upside since crashes are one of the strong catalysts for higher highs. I&amp;amp;#39;ve found &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ar.ca/blog/author/katie-talati&quot;&amp;gt;Katie Talatie&amp;amp;#39;s&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; comments on the impact of US markets on crypto particularly enlightening in this sense.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/n4nq0hbb7ww81.png?width=1274&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=8c26e0b61a453b203e26fd283d95e79c717a45d9&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/n4nq0hbb7ww81.png?width=1274&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=8c26e0b61a453b203e26fd283d95e79c717a45d9&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Talati explains best what she is closest to, the dynamics of US crypto markets. In Europe the situation is different, as shown also in the above chart, retail adoption/activity prevails in European markets. This is why in Europe the optics are different and non inflationary cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are seen as a double threat to the euro, because try also facilitate capital flights into usd. This brings us back to the second weapon proposed by De Vries to limit the impact/competitiveness of crypto against the euro without upsetting US players, that is that of limiting/restricting the trading of bitcoin (the most hated crypto by EU banks). It won&amp;amp;#39;t be long before we see some laws in this regard in EU.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Conclusion&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Every crypto enthusiast, especially in the EU, should be aware of the sophisticated attack orchestrated and executed by the DNB and ECB against crypto. This attack is happening right under everyone&amp;amp;#39;s nose and is aimed at keeping europeans backed in a corner with no choice but to keep their wealth in euros, from where it can be siphoned off/stolen through inflation. It is likely that other regulators around the globe will copy these strategies or become more receptive to them. While I believe that crypto markets will eventually shake them, I think this will be a long war as regulators and banks won&amp;amp;#39;t give up easy. `&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Beware and distance yourself of politicians or political parties that are aligned to these policies.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; This is a fight that has to be fought by today&amp;amp;#39;s population of crypto enthusiasts. We need to keep exposing and educating.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/vjdeu6fc7ww81.png?width=2292&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=40b9032eb90e57fe19f1539d0dc3edb9e0dba23d&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/vjdeu6fc7ww81.png?width=2292&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=40b9032eb90e57fe19f1539d0dc3edb9e0dba23d&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Another attack vector is privacy. As people opt out of the euro, surveillance laws like the proposed last month on unhosted wallets, should become more frequent and more invasive. As many surveys by the European Commission itself have shown however (chart below), privacy is where the efforts to strangulate crypto are more likely to become a political issue because europeans, even those who are not necessarily into crypto today, value privacy more than anything else when it comes to their finances.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;TLDR&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;: The current anti crypto EU regulations are based on a doctrine by Alex De Vries, a DNB analyst and University researcher, who argues that breaking bitcoin&amp;amp;#39;s halving price rally cycles is the most effective way for europeans to undermine crypto adoption. He specifically proposes taxing/limiting crypto transactions and implementing trade restrictions against certain cryptos.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The massive demand led to ETH fees worth nearly $200 million to be spent on gas for the land sale in one hour. This is because their contract had nearly zero gas optimizations.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Will Papper, the co-founder of Syndicate DAO, tweeted a few “tricks” that could have “saved many millions.” Here are some parts of the Twitter thread:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Gas optimization 1: Remove the ERC721Enumerable extension.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/h36vcy84ouw81.png?width=1200&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=0fe910f48ab3529bf7f5abba2c4d4aab3d677602&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/h36vcy84ouw81.png?width=1200&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=0fe910f48ab3529bf7f5abba2c4d4aab3d677602&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The ERC721Enumerable extension is used to track the owners of an NFT on-chain. Mints that remove the ERC721Enumerable extension save around 70% in gas costs. This tiny change would have saved around $70M that hour. The ERC721Enumerable extension is mostly unnecessary. In the majority of cases, tracking ownership on-chain is not useful. Why? You can just grab the data off-chain on the front-end and pass it into smart contracts instead! Every front-end is able to handle this easily.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Gas optimization 2: Use ERC721A (erc721a.org). ERC721A is a standard developed by the @AzukiOfficial team.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This extension means that minting multiple NFTs to the same wallet is nearly the same price as minting a single NFT. This would save money for every multi-mint. ERC721A makes transfers slightly more expensive but mints dramatically cheaper. In this case where the gas fees on the mint are so high, this is clearly worth it. The vast majority of the mints were multi-mints. All of these incurred 2X or more in unnecessary costs ($10M+)  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Gas optimization 3: Switch from _safeMint() to _mint()&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/8p5c8zg8ouw81.png?width=1199&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=a1cf3f45f2826502d7ea517cf948d8573adb9b70&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/8p5c8zg8ouw81.png?width=1199&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=a1cf3f45f2826502d7ea517cf948d8573adb9b70&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;_safeMint() checks every address to ensure that it can handle NFTs. If the address is not able to handle NFTs, it ensures that the transaction will fail. This is unnecessary. Every address minting can likely handle NFTs. Image _safeMint() is one of the more annoying and unnecessary parts of the ERC721 standard. In theory it ensures that mints are going to wallets that can handle NFTs, in practice it adds gas and makes mints less safe!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/ahzeq1neouw81.png?width=1199&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=1719f786d9941d7690cfa7b833f0bea33ce609d3&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/ahzeq1neouw81.png?width=1199&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=1719f786d9941d7690cfa7b833f0bea33ce609d3&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This condition is only hit for very non-standard smart contracts. Image Implementing these gas optimizations would be as simple as:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Change the word &amp;amp;quot;ERC721Enumerable&amp;amp;quot; to &amp;amp;quot;ERC721&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Import ERC721A&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Change the word &amp;amp;quot;_safeMint()&amp;amp;quot; to &amp;amp;quot;_mint()&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Modifying a few words would have saved $80M+.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yuga Labs also addressed the event&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/c669czzoouw81.png?width=1058&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=09b6b7ef2a5cfe22ed3ebcc334c1d2e76af6d96f&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/c669czzoouw81.png?width=1058&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=09b6b7ef2a5cfe22ed3ebcc334c1d2e76af6d96f&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I have my own little conspiracy theory that they had this inefficient launch on purpose to justify having an “ApeChain”.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I actually think it’s kind of neat that the ETH got burned because of yuga’s carelessness (and my selfishness lol). Instead of that $100m going to yuga and the apes, it got kinda redistributed to every other ETH holder.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;EDIT: Solana is at 2 TPS right now and is basically down LMAO&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now I’ll press ahead.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yeah it’s fast and cheap since it boasts what might be the highest TPS in the market.  But what use is this ultra high TPS if half of the time I can’t even use the network cause of its awful downtime?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Even their own freaking CEO notoriously said “it doesn’t matter if the network crashes”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If the CEO of a platform or service doesn’t trust its performance, then why tf should I trust it? It just makes no sense how this coin is still at number 6 in rank.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sure, almost every chain on the market has suffered from downtime here and there but never to the extent that Solana did.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I would much rather stay where I am on Polygon right now. Transactions are just as fast and even cheaper and their ecosystem is WAY more superior with recent news about more than 19k dApps build on top of it.
But most importantly, its way more reliable.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And its not just Polygon. I just mentioned it cause its the platform I use the most. Literally any other platform right now is more reliable than Solana.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yet people still invest in this centralized chain.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Litecoin for example (and I am sure there are many other examples that people can name) has had 100 percent uptime with literally no hacks or exploits, yet people instantly dismiss.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It brings me to the conclusion that we don&amp;amp;#39;t really care about fundamentals in the crypto space, only juicy profits. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So it brings me back to the original point of this post, why an earth are people investing in SOL when it is the least secure and reliable chain in crypto?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Everybody saying that now is the time to buy are just a bunch of bag holders who want you to invest so they can sell as soon as breaking even. Even genius investor Warren Buffett has stated that he wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t buy bitcoin for $25 dollars, who are we to disagree with 150 years of experience in the crypto space?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/e4hrhnjzxqw81.jpg?width=1284&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=05dacabdee2543b6080b3b0c9955db5236ddf551&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/e4hrhnjzxqw81.jpg?width=1284&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=05dacabdee2543b6080b3b0c9955db5236ddf551&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;as you can see above the crypto Fear and Greed index has hit a new low of (-20) Fire sale&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;what does this mean?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I heard reports that crypto investors are jumping out of their cabanas out in the Caribbean, sure they are landing in the ocean but that besides the point. It really does appear that after a decade Bitcoin has finally died.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;this was a great journey friends but we should probably sell any remaining crypto we have and put that money into a savings account with a high interest rate of 0.001%, we should be able to retire with it after another 50 years.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;good luck to you all!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Let me run down why for you:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;GPU prices are going back closer to MSRP&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;New gens of GPU and CPU are released later this year&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;mainstream medias supression of the announcement has suppressed LRC price, but that is bullish for us&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I personally know of a few friends who gave up gaming and sold their rigs when they changed jobs/ had children.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I spoke to some of them the other day about Loopring X GME and they told me they were considering building a new rig so they could experience what the GameStop NFT marketplace had to offer!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They were excited about the following:
- unique skins for weapons for your account
- unique content/ DLC which only you own
- certifiable ownership of your games on the blockchain (suck it, steam!!)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So really, this downturn coupled with MSMs suppression of GameStops announcement is probably going to work against them in the long run.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As our messiah Byron wrote on discord “sometimes you have to pick the highest mountain to find the most precious flower” and wow - LRC is that flower, and we are almost at the top!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Lööp up, brothers!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: wow, paid FUDders already downvoting! Bullish!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit 2: thanks for the suicide bot report, kind stranger!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/rxswfz611ow81.png?width=701&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=3ff222bc0575ad917c34ba5930da13242bf7532a&quot;&amp;gt;GoDaddy Broker first offered $500 &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;GoDaddy Broker first offered $500 for the domain which was already an insane amount for $16 domain But he negotiated his way to $450K.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/bnvw70hc1ow81.png?width=702&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=ec17a99a030332a6c37948e0a96f7f410806676d&quot;&amp;gt;This person had some dedicated. He declined  12,500x profit.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/5j0hocrh1ow81.png?width=620&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=d6ce979bbc9a48b0f1bea3ddf9af56e2cf3a5743&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/5j0hocrh1ow81.png?width=620&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=d6ce979bbc9a48b0f1bea3ddf9af56e2cf3a5743&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;First the broker didn&amp;amp;#39;t like his 10 BTC demand, was also shaming him for his insane demand. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

After 5 red weeks back in 2018 there was 1 green week and another 2 red weeks. The second of them found the bottom - 3156$ wich was lowest price for that cycle.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If history is going to repeat, it all can means, that bottom is really near and we will see rebound soon.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But this only one way of look.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The 2nd one is, we know shit about fuck and this thought doesn&amp;amp;#39;t mean anything at all.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyway, I hope you enjoyed that. Stay safe out there people, lots of scammers on the prowl for anyone vulnerable. Never give anyone anything.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;hr/&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIUrE7Ovm5k&quot;&amp;gt;Coffeezilla&amp;amp;#39;s latest video&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;hr/&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This one is much quicker, snappier, and devastating.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The gist of it is that the Safemoon community has spent the last week and a half fervently denying that the wallets Coffee speculated were CEO John Karony&amp;amp;#39;s was a personal wallet, and therefore the movements in and out of the liquidity pools and receiving large payments from Bitmart etc were all kosher.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Someone tipped Coffee off to &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;yet another&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; pump-and-dump scheme organised by Ben Phillips, where Karony spent $300,000 on shitcoins. Ben Phillips also was part of some Hotdog NFT bullshit, and Karony mentioned he liked one publicly on twitter... that very safe NFT is owned by a wallet that Coffee uncovers.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;hr/&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The video does a much better job of explaining it than I do, but we&amp;amp;#39;re in the Endgame now fellas.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My RES tags on Reddit have been pulling overtime with all the people I&amp;amp;#39;ve tagged as &amp;amp;quot;Safemoon Cultist&amp;amp;quot;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What do they have to say? Let&amp;amp;#39;s find out.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Whale sold. Watch this dip get eaten.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Awwww. Just because you lost YOUR life savings and are butter hurt, doesn&amp;amp;#39;t mean everyone else is. Don&amp;amp;#39;t be mad... once FOMO hits, you&amp;amp;#39;ll be back.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Please stop buying bro karoney is stealing 100 trillion money i saw on ioutube truste me please stop ✋ 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We have less whales than most crypto tokens. Just check babscan!  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Well, if you would have paid attention you would know that when the youtuber posted his first video the price went down 25%... this time he posted and the price stayed pretty much the same. That&amp;amp;#39;s all  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;(That one aged like milk on a hot Texas day)  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“Why isn’t my fud working? Why aren’t they selling? Time to make up more shit!”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If it is a rug pull, would it be logical to spent 1 mln on a bill board, hire top qualified personnel, launch wallet, work on exchange, blockchain, card, websites, cross chain, etc. Would you start a LLC with liability, would you doxx, etc.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I haven’t watched any of his videos. Don’t need to  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Stopped reading at copy and paste wallet, that&amp;amp;#39;s a marching order term right there&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m fairly confident that this will be remembered as Safemoon&amp;amp;#39;s low point.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I believe this is all fud to make the price drop on purpose 😉&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So we have a mixed bag really. Most of the people who haven&amp;amp;#39;t already sold are just sticking their heads in the sand but the mounting volume of proof is starting to resonate with more and more people.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There&amp;amp;#39;s still quite a sizeable portion of people that think a turnaround is about to happen... So I guess let&amp;amp;#39;s sit back, crack open the popcorn and keep watching this incredible shit-show.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
